        "Title": "Amendment 5",
        "Content": " Amendment rationale \u2022 The main purpose of this amendment is to address Health Authority requests to provide a Risk Benefit statement (Section 3.6) previously included under introduction and purpose (Section 3.6), and allow more countries to apply the contraceptive wording originally provided for UK sites only.  \u2022 In addition, the DMC concerns regarding potential for transient symptomatic hypocalcemia after first infusion are addressed by adding additional calcium supplementation at the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for age in Table 5-1 for up to 10 days around time of infusion (in line with Institutional clinical practice guidelines). \u2022 Table 5-1 has been revised in line with the current minimum RDAs for vitamin D and calcium from the Institute of Medicine. \u2022 This amendment includes clarification of the list of eligible medical conditions other than chronic rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) already specified previously. These additional conditions are listed in Appendix 7 and the eligibility criteria have been revised to address these as follows: \u2022 Due to the inclusion of some of these additional medical conditions, the exclusion criterion of renal impairment previously defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening has been increased to normal renal function defined as < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the Schwartz formula at screening. In addition \u2018serious renal disease\u2019 in DMD has been removed as this is included under the GFR exclusion.  \u2022 The exclusion criterion \u2018symptomatic cardiac abnormality\u2019 in DMD has been redefined as follows because other conditions or concomitant medications, including glucocorticoids can contribute to cardiac disease: Uncontrolled symptoms of cardiac failure or arrhythmia. \u2022 Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations have been revised to the currently accepted definition of normal i.e. < 20 ng/mL or < 50 nmol/L at screening.  \u2022 The blood volume required for the analysis of certain markers of bone markers has been reduced from 8.5 mL to 3 mL.  \u2022 Inconsistencies have been corrected within the protocol and across supporting documents especially with respect to Serious Adverse Event reporting from signing informed consent.  \u2022 In this 12 month study, visit windows have been removed and replaced with a requirement to perform the visit close to the designated day.  \u2022 The latest Novartis protocol template has been used to aid the reader in navigating the protocol and more recent references provided that reflect the increase in knowledge of childhood osteoporosis since the protocol was first proposed. \u2022 The 12 month open label extension study CZOL446H2337E1 has been added for all patients who complete this core study. These changes are implemented throughout the protocol. Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 10 \nClinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean \n \nProtocol No. CZOL446H2337 \n \nStatus of the study as of 15-Oct-2015:  \nEighteen (18) patients have been randomized onto this study; the proposed changes will have \nno impact on the interpretation of the data with the exception of the definition of the evaluable \n(MITT) population which clarifies that patients must all have a baseline DXA (identical to \nITT) and at least one post-baseline DXA. \nChanges to the protocol \nChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown by track changes in the track changes \nversion of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions, and red underlined for \ninsertion. \nA copy of this amended protocol will be sent to the Institutional Review Board \n(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committee (IECs) and Health Authorities.  \nThe changes described in this amended protocol require IRB/IEC approval prior to \nimplementation. The changes herein do not affect the Informed Consent Form to be signed by \nparent(s) or guardian(s). \nSummary of previous amendments \nAmendment 4 \nThe main purpose of the amendment (16-Aug-2013) was to extend the study population to \ninclude subjects with Glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIO) associated with underlying \nconditions other than chronic inflammatory disorders.  \nRelax the LS-BMD Z-score inclusion criteria from -1.0 to -0.5 or worse \nInclude an assessment of urinary concentration of zoledronic acid at 6 months after dosing. \nAmendment 3 \nThe main purpose of Amendment 3 (dated 15-Jul-2010) was to update the original Schwartz \nFormula to the updated Schwartz formula: \nGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = k [height (m)/Scr (mg/dl)] \nk = Constant \nk = 0.41 \nAmendment 3 also incorporated changes which only apply to the UK sites when they enroll \nfemale patients of child bearing potential. \nThese changes incorporate additional information on theoretical risks to a developing fetus in \nthe Pregnancy section and an additional supervised urine pregnancy test at week 12. \nAmendment 2 \nThe main purpose of Amendment 2 (dated 23-Sep-2008) was to allow patients to receive their \nfirst study drug infusion (Visit 2) in the out-patient setting at the clinical discretion of the \nstudy investigators. In addition, clarification was provided for the definition of \u201cVitamin D \nand calcium supplementation\u201d and \u201clow trauma fracture\u201d. \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 11 \nClinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean \n \nProtocol No. CZOL446H2337 \n \nAmendment 1  \nThe main purpose of Amendment 1 (dated 17-Jul-2008) was to clarify and amend the \nosteoporosis inclusion criteria to include one or more \n lower extremity long bone \nfractures and/or two or more \n upper extremity long bone fractures. The following \nitems were also amended to refine the protocol and further ensure patient safety: measuring \nbone-age at screening and month 12; collecting pain assessment by the Faces Pain Scale- \nRevised (FPS-R) at Baseline, months 3, 6, 9 and 12;\n \n \nNovartis Confidential Page 12 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean  Protocol No. CZOL446H2337  ",

                "Content": "  Osteoporosis in children is a very different disease to osteoporosis in adults. Children have not attained peak bone mass, and sufficient data correlating bone density with fractures are not available. The role of lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) in the risk of fracture has been evaluated in some childhood illnesses, particularly osteogenesis imperfecta (primary osteoporosis). Although the diagnosis of osteoporosis in adults is based on BMD, Sbrocchi 2011 reported a child with glucocorticoid responsive nephrotic syndrome and fragility fracture; bone biopsy revealed signs of osteoporosis with marked thinning of the cortices and decreased trabecular bone volume, suggesting that DXA-based, LS-BMD should not be relied upon exclusively for assessing bone health in children, and that a LS-BMD Z-score of -0.5 is sufficient. Further, the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) now defines pediatric osteoporosis as the finding of one or more low impact vertebral compression fractures (Genant Grade 1 or more) in the absence of a change in BMD (Bishop et al 2014).  Patients receiving high doses of glucocorticoids are at increased risk of significant bone loss and fractures; glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is now recognized as one of the most important reasons for secondary osteoporosis in adults as well as children. Prior glucocorticoid use confers a substantial increase in fracture risk in adults, and this risk is largely independent of BMD or a prior fragility fracture (Kanis et al 2004). Studies in adults suggest that glucocorticoid treatment for 3 months is sufficient to increase fracture risk, and similar data have been collected in children and adolescents where almost one-half of the patients with fractures were asymptomatic (Leblanc et al 2015). The earliest observation of vertebral fractures in children with rheumatic disorders is 4 months after starting systemic glucocorticoids (Rodd et al 2012). The etiology of secondary osteoporosis in children with inflammatory disorders is multifactorial and varies with the particular disease. Overlapping risk factors seen in chronic inflammatory conditions include poor nutrition and malabsorption of both calcium and fat-soluble vitamins. Direct detrimental effects on bone due to high circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha have been reported. The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and nephrotic syndrome includes glucocorticoid therapy which further worsens bone mineral status.   While there is no primary bone involvement in DMD, the reduced mechanical loading and poor ambulation lead to osteoporosis, which is further compounded by the side effects of chronic glucocorticoid therapy. Osteoporosis is most profound in the lower extremities of boys with DMD and begins to develop early while still ambulatory (Larson 2000). Other examples of diseases of children treated with intermittent high doses of glucocorticoids where osteoporosis is also a risk include asthma, myasthenia gravis and Becker\u2019s dystrophy, and etc. (see Appendix 7).  Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 16 \nClinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean \n \nProtocol No. CZOL446H2337 \n \nThere is no established treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children, although treatment \nfor adult osteoporosis including GIO is currently well established for bisphosphonates. \nPlacebo controlled trials using bisphosphonates such as risedronate and alendronate have been \nshown to increase BMD and reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in patients initiating \nglucocorticoids or receiving such a treatment for a longer period of time. In adults, regulatory \napproval for treatment and prevention of osteoporosis has been granted for bisphosphonates. \nAlthough bisphosphonates have been used experimentally in the treatment of specific \npediatric metabolic bone disease, only one, neridronate is currently approved in Italy for \nosteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Pamidronate is provided as an example of bisphosphonates for \nconsideration in the management of DMD boys with \u2018bone demineralization and increased \nfracture risk\u2019 (Bushby et al 2009).  \nZoledronic acid \nZoledronic acid (ZOL) is representative of a third generation bisphosphonate and is the most \npotent bisphosphonate marketed. In a variety of assays of bone metabolism, ZOL has \ndemonstrated inhibition of bone resorption in vitro at concentrations of 0.3-30 nM and in vivo \nat doses of 0.3-30\u00b5g/kg without exerting any untoward effects on either bone formation or \nmineralization. A large difference exists between various bisphosphonates in terms of potency \nand effects on mineralization. There is an inverse relationship between potency and \nmineralization defects. These mineralization defects have occurred in patients treated with the \nupper therapeutic dose range of etidronate. In animal models, zoledronic acid has \ndemonstrated extremely high potency in terms of antiresorptive effect without adverse effects \non mineralization even at high doses; hence there appears to be a large therapeutic window \nbetween the desired inhibition of resorption and unwanted inhibition of mineralization in \nthese models [see Investigator\u2019 Brochure (IB)]. \nZOL is marketed as Aclasta\u00ae outside of the US and for Paget\u2019s disease of bone and PMO as \nReclast\u00ae within the US. As Aclasta, ZOL is approved as a single infusion for the treatment of \nPaget\u2019s disease of bone and as once annual dosing for the treatment of postmenopausal \nosteoporosis (PMO), treatment of osteoporosis in men, prevention and treatment of \nglucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO), prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis \n(PMO) and prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture in men and women. Moreover, it \nis approved for the prevention of skeletal-related events (pathological fractures, spinal \ncompression, radiation or surgery to bone) or tumor-induced treatment of hypercalcemia of \nmalignancy as Zometa\u00ae using a 10-fold higher dose on a yearly basis (4mg once monthly). \nAclasta/Reclast is currently under review for the additional indications of treatment and \nprevention of GIO and the treatment of low bone mass in men with osteoporosis. Further \ninformation can be found in the current version of the IB. \nA 2007 Cochrane Review (Ward et al 2007) of bisphosphonate therapy for children and \nadolescents with secondary osteoporosis concluded that though there was not enough \ninformation in the studies included within the review to assess if bisphosphonates would make \na difference to children\u2019s bone mineral content (BMC), and that further use of \nbisphosphonates in the context of pediatric trials was justified. \nNovartis Confidential Page 17 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean  Protocol No. CZOL446H2337  ",

                "Content": " Zoledronic acid dose selection for Study CZOL446H2337 is based on several sources of information, including safety and efficacy data from completed Novartis clinical trials in adults with postmenopausal osteoporosis, pediatric patients with severe OI, long-term safety in pediatric patients with OI, and a PK study in pediatric patients with severe OI. Published data is available from trials in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (Reid 2002; Black 2007). Adults with benign disease (Paget\u2019s and PMO) have received ZOL safely up to 5 mg i.v. by slow injection (over 15 minutes) over various dosing frequencies. Cancer patients have received between 4 and 8 mg i.v. monthly, in long-term studies (> 1 year). In the Novartis ZOL pediatric studies to date, the dose schedule was an infusion of 0.05 mg/kg (max 4 mg) administered quarterly. This dose was extrapolated from a comparison with a pamidronate infusion in patients with tumor-induced hypercalcemia that showed that 4 mg ZOL was more effective than 90 mg pamidronate. The 4 mg dose of ZOL represents an approximate adult dose of ZOL of 0.07 mg/kg or a dose of pamidronate of 1.5 mg/kg for a 60 kg adult. Pamidronate 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg administered every 6 months was the dose range and interval used in the long-term pamidronate OI study (Glorieux et al 1998). However, in this trial, the Novartis Confidential Page 21 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean  Protocol No. CZOL446H2337  pamidronate dosing interval was shortened to a 4-month dosing regimen to improve the response in bone markers of disease activity, monitored each month. Study CZOL446H2202 (see IB) is the largest Novartis-sponsored trial in pediatric patients with metabolic bone disease. This 12-month study compared the efficacy and safety of i.v. zoledronic acid 0.05 mg/kg administered quarterly to i.v. pamidronate 1.0 mg/kg on each of 3 successive days administered quarterly in 155 patients with severe OI. The results showed that ZOL was superior to pamidronate in increasing LS-BMD at Month 12 and in reducing markers of bone turnover, both formation and resorption. Additionally, clinical fracture reduction within treatment was significant overall, and regardless of OI type. The overall incidence rate of adverse events was similar between the two treatment groups. There was no evidence of a long-term effect on renal function following the administration of ZOL in this patient population. The pharmacokinetics of a single infusion of ZOL 0.05 mg/kg, in children aged 3-8 years and 9-17 years, were similar to those observed in adult oncology patients at approximately the same mg/kg dose. Plasma concentrations in the pediatric patients were generally at or below the median concentrations in adults, which may be an advantage in consideration of drug safety and tolerability in children. In a second trial with OI patients (see IB for study CZOL446H2202E1), the 12-month extension study, long-term safety was assessed in 103 patients receiving 0.05 mg/kg zoledronic acid either as an annual infusion or twice a year (6 months apart). In this study, median increases in LSBMD were approximately 1.3% higher in patients who received the twice yearly dosing of zoledronic acid. Though these data from the extension study should be interpreted with caution as the sample sizes are too small to make definitive conclusions, it is established that there is an effect of puberty on bone degradation, with children demonstrating high bone resorption relative to adults.  Therefore, the zoledronic acid dose and interval selected for this protocol, 0.05 mg/kg as two i.v. infusions at a 6 month interval, is expected to provide superior efficacy (as measured by change in LS-BMD Z-score) compared to placebo in pediatric patients with osteoporosis. The maximum allowable zoledronic acid dose of 5 mg (regardless of patient weight), does not exceed the doses already used in adults and is well within the maximum zoledronic acid dose tested in Phase I Novartis Oncology trials: zoledronic acid 16 mg by slow i.v. infusion. In this study in children with osteoporosis, zoledronic acid will be administered as an i.v. infusion over at least 30 minutes. ",

                "Content": "  Benefit The potential benefit of zoledronic acid in children at risk of osteoporosis due to underlying disease or intermittent high dose glucocorticoids is outlined below and in the IB.  There is evidence that bisphosphonates have anti-apoptotic effects on osteoblasts and osteocytes which may lead to increased trabecular thickness and thus, may partly explain why bisphosphonates produce a greater reduction in fracture risk than that expected from BMD gains alone (Plotkin 1999). Furthermore, BMD is greatly influenced by sex steroids, and puberty can be delayed in the presence of GC which can also result in short stature which may be offset by the use of bisphosphonates (Glorieux et al 1998).  The most commonly studied bisphosphonate in children has been i.v. pamidronate in the treatment of a primary juvenile osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The typical treatment protocol reported in OI is administration of pamidronate on three consecutive days in hospital (Glorieux et al 1998). There is some variation of dosing frequency (typically every 1 to 4 months, depending upon the age of the patient, with younger patients receiving more frequent infusions). Treatment requiring three consecutive days of intravenous therapy every several months can cause a significant burden of both time and cost. The efficacy of cyclic single-day intravenous pamidronate infusions in a heterogeneous group of patients between 6 to 21 years of age was studied and demonstrated similar improvements in bone density and in fracture rate as reported with 3-day infusions in patients with OI (Steelman 2003).  A direct comparison of 2-day pamidronate (PAM) to a 2-day infusion of ZOL has been published in 23 children with OI (Barros et al 2012). Twelve months after treatment, the PAM and ZOL groups average LS-BMD increased by 51.8 % (p = 0.053) and 67.6 % (p = 0.003), respectively. LS-BMD Z-score for the ZOL group at the end of treatment was higher compared with the PAM group but only a borderline significance (p = 0.053). Only mild side effects were reported in both groups and the authors concluded that ZOL was not different from PAM in efficacy and safety in this group of children. More recently, a retrospective study reviewed treatment with PAM and ZOL and followed up the children for up to 2 years (Bowden et al 2015). The authors reported that i.v. bisphosphonate therapy significantly increased BMD and reduced fracture rate during the treatment with a beneficial effect in BMD maintained for 2 years after discontinuation of therapy. A second retrospective study reviewed PAM administered in cycles of 1.5 mg/kg per day over 2 days every 3 months and ZOL as a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg every 6 months to patients aged at least 5 years with type I or IV OI (Saraff et al 2015). Twenty children were identified in each group; LS-BMD Z-scores increased significantly in both groups over 12 months (p<0.001) with no significant differences shown between PAM and ZOL. Another study has been conducted by the sponsor to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ZOL as compared to pamidronate in the treatment of children with severe OI (Study CZOL446H2202 described in IB). The ZOL treated group, had a mean 42.7% increase from baseline in LS-BMD at Month 12 compared with a mean increase of 34.7% in the pamidronate treated group. These changes were consistent with pediatric OI literature which has reported an annualized increase in BMD of 41.9% with cyclical pamidronate (Glorieux et al 1998). The deviation from normal, as measured by the LS-BMD Z-score, at both 6 and 12 months showed an improvement with ZOL. Importantly, Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 23 \nClinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean \n \nProtocol No. CZOL446H2337 \n \nboth treatments reduced the occurrence of clinical fractures per patient significantly \n(p<0.0001) following 12 months of treatment, although the proportion of patients who had \nclinical fractures in the 12 months of study treatment was similar in the two groups (ZOL: 32 \npatients, 43.2%; pamidronate: 31 patients, 40.8%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 \u2013 1.72). Of note, \nthere was a higher risk of clinical fracture in the type I patients treated with ZOL compared to \npamidronate (HR 2.12, 95% CI 0.96 \u2013 4.69), and a lower risk of clinical fracture in the type \nIII and IV patients treated with zoledronic acid compared to those patients treated with \npamidronate (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.29 \u2013 1.19). \nThe evidence of bisphosphonate therapy in children and adolescents with secondary \nosteoporosis has been reviewed (Ward et al 2007). More recent retrospective studies and \nreviews on zoledronic acid in children with osteoporosis have been published which report \nbenefits on BMD, bone pain and fractures (Baroncelli and Bertollini 2014,  Boyce et al 2014, \nBrown and Zacharin 2009) and authors agree that prospective randomized controlled trials are \nstill needed to evaluate the benefit risk of bisphosphonates. An increasing number of pediatric \nmetabolic bone experts now reserve bisphosphonate therapy for the management of low bone \nmass in children and adolescents who have symptoms of a fragility fracture (Boyce and Gafni \n2011), and there is one recent publication on the prophylactic use of bisphosphonates in the \nmanagement of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are receiving long-term \nglucocorticoids (Sarkozy et al 2014).   \nRisks \nKnown risks of zoledronic acid \nSince this protocol was first written in 2008, there have been more publications on the \npotential use of bisphosphonates in children with kidney diseases including nephrotic \nsyndrome (Gruppen et al 2013, Sbrocchi et al 2011).  \nZOL is concentrated and excreted via the kidney and, like other bisphosphonates, has the \npotential to produce renal injury. Thus, care should be taken when administering the \ncompound to patients with renal insufficiency. Although case reports have been published in \nadult medicine regarding the nephrotoxicity of ZOL with an incidence of acute kidney injury \n(AKI) between 9% and 13%, bisphosphonate-induced, AKI in children remains \nundocumented (Patzer 2008).  \n\u2022 In this protocol, patients are excluded if they have an estimated GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 \nm2 or a rising serum creatinine increase greater than 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 \u00b5mol/L) between \nVisit 1 and Visit 2. Patients who have nephrotic syndrome with osteoporosis, who do not \nmeet these exclusion criteria, have been stable for 3 months prior to enrollment, and meet \nthe remaining eligibility criteria can be considered for this study.  \nPost-infusion acute phase reactions are more common after the first infusion and can include \npyrexia, muscle and joint pain.  \n\u2022 To reduce the risk of these reactions, children will be instructed to eat and drink as usual, \nNSAIDs or acetaminophen (paracetamol) will be prescribed and an anti-emetic may be \nprovided to reduce the risk of symptomatic hypocalcemia if the child develops nausea or \nstarts to vomit. Further calcium supplements will be provided for up to 10 days at the time \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 24 \nClinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean \n \nProtocol No. CZOL446H2337 \n \nof infusion and parent/guardian instructions provided on the signs to watch for as well as \nan emergency number, if needed. \nHypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, \nbronchospasm and urticaria are listed in the IB. Therefore, children with a previous known \nhypersensitivity are excluded. Should a child develop a hypersensitivity reaction, it must be \nreported as an adverse event.  \nA rare risk in patients who receive bisphosphonates is osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). This \ncondition has been reported primarily in cancer patients whose complex treatment regimens \ninclude higher doses and frequencies of bisphosphonates, typically administered with other \ntreatments such as radiation, chemotherapy and glucocorticoids. To date and to the best of our \nknowledge, ONJ has not been reported in the literature in children or adolescents who have \nreceived bisphosphonates. Based on available evidence, a causal relationship between ONJ \nand bisphosphonates, including ZOL, has not been established.  \n\u2022 In this study a lower dose and short duration of zoledronic acid is used than has been \nreported in cases of ONJ in adults, and all children will have an examination of their oral \ncavity during the study and referred to a dentist if necessary. \nPotential risks of zoledronic acid in a pediatric population \nBased on the results from animal studies showing inhibition of bone calcification by first \ngeneration bisphosphonates (Mashiba 2001), there are theoretical concerns about negative \neffects on growth in children. In growing children, each bisphosphonate treatment cycle leads \nto the accumulation of a thin band of mineralized tissue at the interface between growth plate \nand metaphysis which is evident as a metaphyseal line on the radiograph (Land et al 2006a). \nThese lines represent persistent calcified cartilage in the horizontal trabeculae which later \nremodels into secondary bone. This interface between weaker bone and stronger \nbisphosphonate-treated bone could represent a site for potential fracture. However, in clinical \ntrials with i.v. bisphosphonates, linear growth in children and adolescents has not been \nobserved to be negatively impacted with no observed increase in fracture. To the contrary, \ncyclical i.v. treatment with pamidronate has been shown to be beneficial in children with \nsevere forms of OI (Glorieux et al 1998).  \n\u2022 To investigate this potential risk, a placebo control is used for comparison; all patients will \nhave DXA examination at 6 and 12 months and in the event of clinical worsening or \ndiagnosis of new fracture, an X-ray will be performed. \nAnother concern in children is effects on the reproductive organs. The animal reproduction \nstudies of zoledronic acid are described in the Investigator\u2019s Brochure. Teratogenicity was \nobserved in the rat, but not the rabbit when treatment during the perinatal period resulted in \ndelayed parturition likely resulting from the calcium lowering effect of the compound outside \nof bone, which negatively affects uterine contraction. There were no effects reported in males.  \n\u2022 Consequently this protocol requires contraception in all girls who are pubertal and may \nbecome pregnant and in some countries additional pregnancy checks will be made. \nThere are potential concerns regarding the i.v. infusion in children. Apart from the potential \nrisks at the infusion site of pain, infection, phlebitis, hematoma and extravasation, the infusion \nmay also cause fluid overload if the rate is too high and this can result in hypertension, heart \nNovartis Confidential Page 25 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean  Protocol No. CZOL446H2337  failure or pulmonary edema. Additional risks of the infusion can include electrolyte imbalance and embolism. \u2022 The infusion is administered in a hospital or clinic by staff experienced in administering i.v. infusions to children. The infusion line is flushed with saline before and after administration and the infusion given over at least 30-minutes e.g. in a 25 kg child, 100 mL may be administered over one hour at a rate of 5 mL/minute. Protocol procedures: blood draws and radiology The number of blood draws and frequency of hospital visits in this protocol is within the usual limit of clinical practice for children with these serious underlying diseases. The radiation exposure is increased over routine clinical practice, but within the limits for children who have suffered a fracture and no greater than the exposure during a transatlantic flight. Repeat blood draws and X-rays/DXA will only be requested when absolutely necessary i.e. safety, baseline or end-of-study visits. In summary, the risks to the children and adolescents in this trial will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria and study procedures, particularly adequate hydration at the time of the infusion, adherence to a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, regular renal monitoring and contraception in girls of child bearing potential. A maximum dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid (regardless of patient weight) and a minimum 30 minute infusion time 6-monthly are designed to reduce the risk of possible adverse effects. This dose regimen has been used in children with primary and secondary osteoporosis and has shown a favorable risk-benefit profile.  ",

However, in studies of 12 months duration, change in BMD has become an acceptable surrogate and has been shown to be a strong indicator of the efficacy of anti-resorptive therapies, including bisphosphonates such as ZOL. Bone marker assessments of change in BSAP, P1NP, TRAP-5b and NTX often parallel the change in BMD over the same time course. NTX and TRAP-5b measure bone resorption while BSAP and P1NP measure bone formation. In the growing child,  bone age also indicate the overall effectiveness of an intervention, but in this study, only trends may be observed over the 12 month period. Bisphosphonates are considered effective in managing bone pain, including fracture pain, and the FPS-R is a scale used to measure pain in children (Bieri et al 1990, Hicks et al 2001). The efficacy measurements listed above are therefore expected to be appropriate for this study. ",

Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline). Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline). All diagnosed cases of ONJ should be considered as \u201cmedically significant\u201d irrespective of whether the event meets the definition of \u201cSerious Adverse Event\u201d under current health authority guidelines. These cases are therefore reported to Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology as well as local health authorities under the guideline of SAE reporting.

Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period after the last study visit should only be reported to Novartis if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment.  All follow-up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow-up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separately as a new event. Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow up information) is collected and recorded on the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form. The investigator must assess the relationship to each specific component of study treatment (if study treatment consists of several components) complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed, signed form by fax within 24 hours after awareness of the SAE to the local Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department. The telephone and fax number of the contact persons in the local department of Drug Safety and Epidemiology, specific to the site, are listed in the investigator folder provided to each site. The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the Novartis Confidential Page 50 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 05) clean  Protocol No. CZOL446H2337  fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the case report form documentation at the study site. Follow-up information should be provided using a new paper SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow-up to a previously reported SAE Follow-up information provided must describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the treatment code was broken or not and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator\u2019s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment a Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.

The null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups in the mean change in LS-BMD Z-score at Month 12 relative to baseline.  In testing this hypothesis, it is assumed that the standard deviations for the two treatment groups is 0.93 under H0 and HA. Based on a primary endpoint of the change in LS-BMD Z-score at 12 months relative to baseline assuming a 0.63 increase in LS-BMD Z-score over 12 months with zoledronic acid and no change in the LS-BMD Z-score in the placebo group and a common standard deviation of 0.93, 82 patients are required to show a significant increase in LS-BMD Z-score at the 0.05 level with 85% power. Adjusting for a dropout rate of 10%, approximately 46 patients per treatment group are required. The amount of information from controlled trials in a pediatric GIO population is limited. The 0.63 increase in LS-BMD Z-score is based on the increase observed with pamidronate-treated children on chronic glucocorticoid therapy presented in (Acott et al 2005). The common standard deviation of 0.93 was estimated from the pamidronate-treated children and untreated control evaluated in (Acott et al 2005). This standard deviation is consistent with the estimate of the standard deviation obtained from the zoledronic acid group of pediatric osteogenesis imperfecta patients in Study CZOL446H2202. Therefore, it is inferred that the assumption of a 0.63 increase in LS-BMD Z-score over 12 months with ZOL is acceptable. ",

        "Content": " Male patients - Development of external genitalia Stage 1: Pre-adolescent. Testes, scrotum, and penis are of about the same size and proportion as in early childhood. Stage 2: The scrotum and testes have enlarged and there is a change in the texture of the scrotal skin. Stage 3: Growth of the penis has occurred, at first mainly in length; these has been further growth of testes and scrotum Stage 4: Penis further enlarged in length and breadth with development of glans. Testes and scrotum further enlarged. There is also further darkening of the scrotal skin Stage 5: Genitalia adult in size and shape Female patients - Breast development Stage 1: Pre-adolescent; elevation of papilla only. Stage 2: Breast bud stage; elevation of breast and papilla as a small mound, enlargement of areola diameter. Stage 3: Further enlargement of breast and areola, with no separation of their contours. Stage 4: Projection of areola and papilla to form a secondary mound above the level of the breast. Stage 5: Mature stage; projection of papilla only, due to recession of the areola to the general contour of the breast. The girls will be asked at each visit if they had begun to menstruate. Male and female patients - Pubic hair Stage 1: Pre-adolescent (can see velus hair similar to abdominal wall). Stage 2: Sparse growth of long, slightly pigmented, downy hair, straight or only slightly curled, appearing chiefly along the labia or the base of the penis. Stage 3: Considerably darker, coarser and more curled hair. The hair spreads sparsely over the junction of the pubes. Stage 4: Hair is now adult in type, but the area covered by is still considerably smaller than in most adults. There is no spread to the medial surface of thighs. Stage 5: Adult in quantity and type, distributed as an inverse triangle of the classically feminine pattern. Spread to the medial surface of the thighs (about age 15 years).
