The expected protocol duration will continue \nthrough successful NDA and subsequent approval (approximately 4 years).  The protocol duration will \nbe extended 4 years in the UK from the approval date of Amendment 3.01.  If it is deemed necessary to \ncontinue treatment after 4 years in the UK, either an amendment will be made to the current protocol \nor a new protocol will be submitted.\nObjectives:\nThe primary objective is to provide continued access to subjects who would like to continue \nLevodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG), after completion of an open-label study (S187.3.003 or \nS187.3.004).\nThe secondary objectives are to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of the LCIG therapeutic \nsystem, and to assess the maintenance of efficacy using data collected from US subjects.\nMethodology:\nThis is a Phase 3B, open-label, multi-center, study.  Subjects will be provided with LCIG, if judged \nmedically indicated and if it is not commercially available.  Data collected will be for evaluation of safety \nand efficacy, and for periodic assessment of the continued appropriateness of the subject's participation in \nthe study.  The decision to continue is based on the Principal Investigator's clinical judgment.\nNumber of Subjects (Planned):\nIt is anticipated that approximately 275 subjects who had participated and completed one of the \nopen-label LCIG clinical trials will be eligible for this continued treatment with LCIG, until it is \ncommercially available.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n5\nDiagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet the following criteria:\n1. The subject should have completed participation in Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004; and, in the \nopinion of the Principal Investigator, would benefit from long-term treatment with LCIG.  For \nCanada, subjects will be allowed to participate in the S187.3.005 study with a minimum of \n6 months of exposure to LCIG in the S187.3.004 study.\n2. The subject must be able to understand the nature of the study and must provide written informed \nconsent prior to the conduct of any study related procedures.  If the subject does not have the \ncapacity to provide informed consent, full informed consent must be obtained from the subject's \nlegally authorized representative.  Consenting will be performed according to local regulations.\nMain Criteria for Exclusion:\nSubjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at Baseline must be excluded from \nparticipation in the study. \n1. Medical, laboratory, psychiatric, or surgical issues deemed by the Investigator to be clinically \nsignificant, and which could interfere with the subject's participation in the study.\nInvestigational Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:\nLCIG is a homogenous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa monohydrate (5 mg/mL) in an \naqueous intestinal gel (carboxymethylcellulose).  LCIG (levodopa [20 mg/mL] and carbidopa \nmonohydrate [5 mg/mL]) is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a jejunal extension tube \ninserted via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG-J).  The intestinal gel is dispensed in a \nmedication cassette reservoir of 100 mL, designed to be connected to a portable subject-operated pump.  \nLCIG infusion is administered over a full 16-hour period.  The gel will be administered as one morning \ndose, followed by continuous infusion for the remainder of the 16-hour period.  In addition to the \nmorning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects will be allowed to self-administer additional doses of \nLCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as the deterioration of motor function.  It is \nrecommended that no more than five extra doses are given per day.  If subjects find it necessary to \nself-administer an increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to \ncontact their physician for appropriate follow-up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as needed.  At \nnight, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed with potable water.\nDuration of Treatment:\nIn countries where LCIG is not commercially available, the treatment will be made available to subjects \nwho complete participation in either LCIG open-label Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004.  Such product \nwill be made available by the Sponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is \nwarranted by the therapeutic benefit.  The latter will be determined in consultancy with the responsible \nneurologist, the subject and the Sponsor.  Subjects who continue to receive study drug will be evaluated \nat least semi-annually by the Investigator.  In cooperation with the investigational site, all necessary \nsupport will be provided by the Sponsor's local representatives.\nReference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:\nNot applicable.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n6\nCriteria for Evaluation:\nSafety and Tolerability Assessments:\nSafety will be assessed by:\n\uf0b7 Physical examination, including weight\n\uf0b7 Neurological examination\n\uf0b7 Vital signs\n\uf0b7 Resting ECGs\n\uf0b7 C-SSRS\n\uf0b7 Clinical laboratory assessments including biochemistry, hematology,  urinalysis, and special labs \nto monitor for vitamin deficiencies\n\uf0b7 Concomitant medication usage\n\uf0b7 Adverse event monitoring (including sleep attacks, development of impulsive behavior and of \nmelanoma)\n\uf0b7 Monitoring complications of the infusion device\nTolerability will be assessed by the number of subjects who complete the study.\nEfficacy Assessments at US Sites Only:\n\uf0b7 Parkinson's Disease Diary\u00a9 assessment of motor state completed for the 3 consecutive days prior \nto each clinic visit\n\uf0b7 The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)\n\uf0b7 Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)\nStatistical Methods:\nThe primary statistical objective of this study will be to evaluate the long-term safety of LCIG.\nSafety Population:\nThe Safety Population includes all subjects who have taken at least one dose of study medication in this \nstudy.\nEfficacy Population:\nThe Efficacy Population includes all subjects at US sites who have taken at least one dose of study \nmedication in this study and have at least one efficacy assessment in this study.  \nSafety:\nThe safety population will be used for the analysis of the safety and tolerability data.\nSafety will be evaluated using adverse events (AEs), complications of the infusion device, and changes in \nlaboratory parameters, electrocardiograms, vital signs, C-SSRS and the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders \nInterview (MIDI).Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n7\nStatistical Methods (Continued):\nEfficacy:\nThe Efficacy Population will be used for the analysis of the efficacy data.\nThe mean change from baseline will be summarized for the following endpoints:\n\uf0b7 Off time, On time with troublesome dyskinesia, and On time without troublesome dyskinesia as \nmeasured by the Parkinson's Disease Diary\n\uf0b7 UPDRS total score, Parts I, II, II and IV scores, and dyskinesia item score\n\uf0b7 PDQ-39 summary index and domain scores\nFor the analysis of change from baseline in efficacy measures, each subject's baseline will be their \nbaseline measure in the first LCIG study in which they participated (e.g., Study S187.3.001, \nStudy S187.3.002 or Study S187.3.004).Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n8\n"

Carbidopa, which does not cross the blood \nbrain barrier, inhibits the extracerebral decarboxylation of levodopa, which means that a \nlarger amount of levodopa becomes available for transportation to the brain and \ntransformation into dopamine.  Without the simultaneous administration of carbidopa, \nmuch larger amounts of levodopa would be required to achieve the desired effect.\nIn advanced stages of PD, patients treated with oral levodopa may develop s evere motor \nfluctuations characterized by unpredictable swings from mobility to immobility (\"on -off\" \nphenomenon) leading to significant difficulties in disease management.  Patients with \nadvanced PD continue to experience significant symptoms despite an increase in the dose \nor frequency of oral administration of levodopa; likely, this is a combined result of the \nshort half-life of levodopa and the unpredictable variability of gastric emptying.  Patients \ncan also experience troublesome involuntary movements or dyskinesias during \"On\" \nperiods so that they cycle between on periods with dyskinesia and \"Off\" periods with \nParkinsonism.\n5  Accordingly, patients with advanced disease suffer severe disability \ndespite current levodopa treatment.  However, there is increasing evidence that continuous \ninfusion of levodopa can reduce both off time and dyskinesia.\n1,6\nThe motor fluctuations and dyskinesias after oral intake of levodopa may be explained by \nan underlying progression of the disease with gradual disappearance of dopaminergic Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n16\nneurons in the brain.  When approaching a certain threshold of degeneration of \ndopaminergic and other neurons, an individuals' capacity to store dopamine in the brain \nand ability to respond to levodopa becomes increasingly unstable.  It has been \nhypothesized that the therapeutic plasma levodopa concentration window becomes \nincreasingly narrow over time.  As a result there is an insufficient response \n(Parkinsonism) when the levodopa concentration is below the window, and troublesome \ndyskinesias occur when the concentration increases above an upper threshold for the \nindividual.  The incidence of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias among patients treated \nwith oral levodopa/carbidopa varies between 20% and 50% of the patients in different \nstudies.\n3,4\nVarious approaches have been taken to cope with the increasingly unstable levodopa \nresponse.  Manipulations of levodopa dose are typically not effective.  Dopamine agonists \nmay be of some value, but are not adequate in advanced cases.  Oral formulations of \nlevodopa are often prescribed in combination with long-acting dopamine agonists and \ncatechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors.7  However, despite individually \noptimizing treatment with these conventional medications, patients with advanced PD \noften do not experience adequate control of their motor performance.  Therefore, \nadditional treatment strategies are needed for these patients.  A number of approaches \nhave been explored and utilized with varying degrees of success; they include the \ncontinuous intravenous (IV) administration of levodopa\n1,8-10 and deep brain stimulation \n(DBS).11  Due to issues of technical and logistic feasibility, continuous administration of \nintravenous (IV) levodopa has not received wide application.  DBS has been used in the \ntreatment of advanced PD patients and has demonstrated improvement of motor \nfluctuations in this patient population, but severe complications have been reported in a \nsubstantial number of patients; the procedure is not available in all settings, it is \nexpensive, and not all PD patients are candidates for brain surgery.\n12\nAlmost three decades ago, it was clearly demonstrated that constant-rate delivery \n(infusion) of levodopa to the blood markedly stabilized motor performance in advanced \nPD patients.9,10,13Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n17\nLCIG is a suspension of levodopa:carbidopa (4:1) in an aqueous gel \n(carboxymethylcellulose) with a viscosity that permits homogeneous distribution of \nmicronized substance particles.  On upper-intestinal administration, the compounds are \ndissolved in situ and levodopa is rapidly absorbed by an active carrier mechanism \nlocalized in the proximal small intestine.  LCIG provides continuous rather than \nintermittent stimulation of the dopaminergic receptors in the brain by permitting plasma \nconcentrations of levodopa to be kept within the individual's therapeutic window.  When \ndelivered via continuous intestinal infusion therapy, LCIG reduces the motor fluctuations \nand increases the \"On\"-time for patients with advanced PD who have received oral tablet \ntreatment with levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor for many years.  The motor fluctuations \nand hyper-/dyskinesias are reduced when plasma concentrations of levodopa are kept \nwithin the individual therapeutic window.  Therapeutic effects on motor fluctuations and \nhyper-/dyskinesias are often achieved during the first treatment day.\nThe delivery of LCIG directly to the proximal small intestine is anticipated to result in the \nfollowing:\n1,2,13,14\n\u25cf Continuous delivery of levodopa-carbidopa\n\u25cf Avoidance of the effects of pulsatile gastric emptying\n\u25cf Reduced variability in plasma-levodopa concentrations\n\u25cf Decreased motor fluctuations and dyskinesias\nLCIG is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a catheter inserted via \npercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy \u2013 with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J).  The LCIG \nis dispensed in medication cassette reservoirs.  The contents of the medication cassette \nreservoir are delivered via continuous administration as illustrated in Figure 1.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n18\nFigure 1. Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel Infusion System\nThe principle aim of LCIG treatment is to continuously infuse levodopa and carbidopa \ndirectly into the proximal small intestine (the duodenum and/or jejunum), where it is \nabsorbed by a carrier-mediated mechanism.  Absorption problems related to erratic gastric\nemptying, early metabolism, and competitive inhibition of intestinal absorption by large \nneutral amino acids will be markedly reduced allowing levodopa to be rapidly absorbed \ninto the bloodstream.  It has been demonstrated that an upper-intestinal infusion of \nlevodopa is associated with reduced variability in plasma levodopa concentrations as \ncompared to oral formulations of levodopa/carbidopa.\n13\nThe efficacy of upper-intestinal administration of levodopa has been demonstrated in \nclinical investigations by decreasing motor fluctuations compared to standard oral \ntherapy.  Results of a 3-week open-label cross-over study (NPP-001-02), with blinded \nassessments of efficacy, demonstrated clinical and statistical superiority of LCIG \ncompared to standard oral therapy with regard to motor fluctuations.2,15  Patients also \nreported significantly improved scores in two Quality of Life (QoL) instruments, the \nParkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and EuroQol Quality of Life Scale \n(EQ-5D).2\nThis open-label, multi-center, Phase 3B study will provide continued treatment with \nLCIG to subjects who have already participated in an open-label treatment study with the \nsame treatment (S187.3.003 or S187.3.004).

The latter will be \ndetermined in consultancy with the responsible neurologist, the subject and the Sponsor.  \nSubjects who continue to receive study drug will be evaluated at least semi-annually by \nthe Investigator.  In cooperation with the investigational site, all necessary support will be \nprovided by the Sponsor's local representatives.  Additionally, the study will allow for \nobservation of the long-term safety, tolerability, and maintenance of efficacy of LCIG \nadministered for several years in a more naturalistic treatment environment.\n6.0 Study Objectives\n6.1 Primary Objective\nThe primary objective of this study is to provide, under well-controlled conditions, \ncontinued access to LCIG treatment to subjects who have already participated in an \nopen-label efficacy and safety trial with the same treatment (Study S187.3.003 or \nS187.3.004), and in whom the need for such continuation is indicated, as confirmed by \nperiodic evaluation, until the product is commercially available.\n6.2 Secondary Objectives\nTo assess the long-term safety and tolerability of the LCIG therapeutic system, and to \nassess the maintenance of efficacy using data collected from US subjects.\nSafety and tolerability will be assessed by the following:\n\u25cf Physical examination, including weight\n\u25cf Neurological examination\n\u25cf Vital signs\n\u25cf Resting ECGs\n\u25cf Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)\n\u25cf Clinical laboratory assessments including biochemistry, hematology, \nurinalysis, and special labs to monitor for vitamin deficiencies"

The study will be conducted at approximately \n70 centers.  In addition, maintenance of efficacy will be evaluated at approximately 28 US \nsites.\nOnly subjects who have completed Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004 will qualify for \nenrollment in this study.  Following informed consent, subjects will have their \ninclusion/exclusion criteria assessed prior to beginning treatment in this study.  Subjects \nare allowed to have a caregiver, if appropriate, assist them with study requirements, Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n21\ni.e., care of the pump and tubing, etc. and the caregiver will have been trained \naccordingly.\nThe initial LCIG dose will be identical to the dose that the subject was receiving at the \nend of the previous open-label LCIG study.  Subsequent dose adjustments will be made as \nclinically indicated by the Investigator.\nIn this open-label study, a recommendation will be made to Investigators to withhold \nconcomitant PD treatments if deemed medically safe and clinically appropriate.  The \ninitiation of additional PD medication may be medically indicated and is allowed at the \ndiscretion of the Investigator.  Also, the dosages of these other PD medications can be \nadjusted upward or downward as needed based on the status of the subject's condition or \nthe development of adverse effects; resumption of discontinued PD medications may also \nbe necessary.\nIn addition to the morning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects will be allowed to \nself-administer additional doses of LCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as \nthe deterioration of motor function.  If subjects find it necessary to self-administer an \nincreasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to contact \nthe Investigator for appropriate follow-up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as \nneeded. \nSubject visit days should ideally match the target clinic visit days; however, a 14 -day visit \nwindow will be allowed as necessary.  Attempt should be made to bring the subj ect back \non the target visit day.\nThe final visit in the previous open-label LCIG study will provide baseline assessments \nfor the S1878.3.005 study.  Subjects will be reassessed every 6 months for the \nappropriateness of the continuation of treatment with LCIG.  If the subject is deemed \ninappropriate for continued treatment by the Investigator, the subject would be \ndiscontinued from treatment and the PEG-J will be removed, with a follow-up visit Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n22\noccurring 1 week later.  For subjects who elect not to continue LCIG treatment, the PEG-J \nwill be removed, and a follow-up clinic visit will occur 1 week later.\nSafety assessments should include physical examination, neurological exam, orthostatic \nvital signs, weight, adverse event monitoring, assessment of impulsive behavior and sleep \nattacks, melanoma check, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical hematology, biochemistry, \nspecial labs to monitor for vitamin deficiencies, and urinalysis.\nThe following efficacy assessments will be completed at US sites: \n\u25cf Parkinson's Disease Diary\u00a9 assessment of motor state completed for the \n3 consecutive days prior to each clinic visit (excluding the drug dispensation \nvisits),\n\u25cf Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and \n\u25cf Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39).\nAt each visit, complications or adverse events with the infusion device (i.e., the tubing \nsystem and the pump) will also be recorded and reported.  Tube placement will be \nchecked by radiography if there is a clinical indication that the tube has been displaced.  \nThe tube will be repositioned, if needed, to the original placement site just beyond the \nligament of Treitz.  At each visit the tube insertion site, including the stoma, will also be \ninspected.  On a yearly basis, at a minimum, an assessment will be made of the need for a \nreplacement of the PEG-J.  The frequency of replacement should be in accordance with \nlocal practice.\nThe protocol duration is planned until the finished product is available commercially in \nthe respective countries where subjects are participating in the study.  The expected \nprotocol duration will continue through successful NDA and subsequent approval \n(approximately 4 years).  The protocol duration will be extended 4 years in the UK from \nthe approval date of Amendment 3.01.  If it is deemed necessary to continue treatment \nafter 4 years in the UK, either an amendment to the current protocol will be made or a \nnew protocol will be submitted.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n23\n"

However, \nthere may be some exceptions to these recommendations based on the Investigator's \nclinical judgment.\nContinuous Maintenance Dose:\nThe maintenance dose is adjustable in steps of 2 mg/hour (0.1 mL/hour).  When \nsupplementary medicines are discontinued or added to the treatment regimen, the LCIG \ndose should be adjusted.  The continuous maintenance dose is adjusted individually.  It \nshould be kept within a range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg levodopa/hour) and is \nusually 2 to 6 mL/hour (40 to 120 mg levodopa/hour).  In exceptional cases, a higher dose \nmay be needed based on the Investigator's clinical judgment.\nExample:\nDaily intake of levodopa as LCIG:  1640 mg/day\nMorning dose: 140 mg = 7 mL\nContinuous maintenance dose thereafter:  1500 mg/day\n1500 mg/day at 20 mg/mL = 75 mL LCIG per day\nThe intake is calculated over 16 hours:  75 mL/16 hours = 4.7 mL/hour.\nExtra Infusion Doses:\nSubjects will be allowed to self-administer extra doses of LCIG to address immediate \nmedical needs, such as the rapid deterioration of motor function.  Extra doses may be \ngiven as required if the subject becomes hypokinetic during the day.  The extra dose \nshould be adjusted individually, normally 0.5 to 2.0 mL.  In rare cases, a higher dose may \nbe needed.  If the need for extra doses exceeds five per day, consideration should be given \nto increasing the maintenance dose.  Additionally, fine adjustments of the morning dose, \nthe maintenance dose and extra doses can be made as needed.\nDuring treatment, Investigator consideration should be given to instances in which \ndeterioration of treatment response occurs.  In the absence of pump alarm notifications, a \nsudden deterioration in treatment response with recurring motor fluctuations could be the Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n30\nresult of the distal part of the tube becoming displaced from the upper intestine into the \nstomach.  The location of the tube should be determined radiographically.  If necessary, \nthe end of the tube can be repositioned to the proximal small intestine and the new \nplacement confirmed radiographically.\nThe tube insertion site, including the stoma, should be inspected at each Study Visit.\n10.6.2 Post LCIG Infusion Night-Time Treatment\nFollowing the discontinuation of the 16-hour LCIG infusion, subjects will be permitted to \nself administer their typical night-time regimen of levodopa-carbidopa tablets (typical \nevening and night-time doses of oral levodopa-carbidopa that they take on a regular \nbasis).   \n10.6.3 Oral Rescue Medication\nOral levodopa-carbidopa medication may only be used to supplement treatment at night \nand should NOT be used during the day, except as rescue medication in case of acute \ndeterioration presumably caused by failure of the LCIG system such as tubes and/or the \npump or the onset of an acute illness.  Extra doses of LCIG should be utilized for these \nsymptoms during the LCIG infusion.\nSubjects should have a supply of oral levodopa-carbidopa IR if for some reason they are \nunable to administer their LCIG infusion.\nOral doses of levodopa-carbidopa taken after the discontinuation of daily LCIG infusion \n(typical evening and night-time doses of oral levodopa-carbidopa taken on a regular basis) \nwill not be counted as rescue medication, as long as the number of tablets taken during \nthat period does not exceed what the subject routinely takes during those hours.  If the \nsubject requires additional oral doses beyond the routine number of tablets of \nlevodopa-carbidopa that are needed as part of the subject's typical night-time regimen, \nthese additional oral doses should be considered rescue doses.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n31\n"

Dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive agent may be required.\nAntidepressants\nThere have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, \nresulting from the concomitant administration of tricyclic antidepressants and \ncarbidopa/levodopa preparations. \nAnticholinergics\nAnticholinergics may act synergistically with levodopa to decrease tremor.  However, \ncombined use may exacerbate abnormal involuntary movements.  Anticholinergics may \ndecrease the effects of levodopa by delaying its absorption.  An adjustment of the dose of \nLCIG may be needed.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n32\nCOMT Inhibitors (tolcapone, entacapone)\nConcomitant use of COMT (Catechol-O-Methyl Transferase) inhibitors and LCIG can \nincrease the bioavailability of levodopa.  The dose of LCIG may need adjustment.\nOther Medicinal Products\nDopamine receptor antagonists (some antipsychotics, e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenons \nand risperidone and antiemetics, e.g., metoclopramide), benzodiazepines, isoniazide, \nphenytoin and papaverine can reduce the therapeutic effect of levodopa.  Subjects taking \nthese medicinal products together with LCIG should be observed carefully for loss of \ntherapeutic response.\nLCIG can be taken concomitantly with the recommended dose of a selective MAO type B \ninhibitor (for instance selegiline-HCl).  However, concomitant use of selegiline and \nlevodopa-carbidopa has been associated with serious orthostatic hypotension.\nAmantadine has synergic effect with levodopa and may increase levodopa related adverse \nevents.

The \ninstrument is designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation, track and assess all \nsuicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed include \nfrequency, duration, controllability, reason for ideation, and deterrents.  The C-SSRS is \nconsidered a low-burden instrument, as it takes less than 5 minutes to administer.  Raters \nwill receive instruction on the administration of the C-SSRS assessment scales prior to \nadministration of the scales.  The C-SSRS will be administered at the times outlined in \nTable 2.\nSubjects expressing suicidal ideation with plan, either by answering \"yes\" to questions 4 \nand/or 5 to the suicidal ideation portion of the C-SSRS or via clinical interview, will be \nevaluated immediately by the Investigator or another medically qualified individual \n(M.D., D.O.).  The Medical Monitor must be notified and the subject will be discontinued \nfrom participation in the study.  The subject will be referred for appropriate psychiatric \nfollow-up treatment, if necessary, per the judgment of the Investigator or the medically \nqualified individual.  The Medical Monitor will also be notified.  In addition, if the subject \nexpresses suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior at any time during the course of the study, \nthe subject should be discontinued from participation in the study and referred for proper \npsychiatric follow-up care.  The Investigator and the Medical Monitor should be notified \nimmediately as well. \nUnder no circumstances should a subject who has positively endorsed or expressed \nsuicidal ideation or behavior be left alone, be allowed to exit the site, or go home \nbefore a qualified medical professional has evaluated the subject's risk.\nThe \"Already Enrolled Subjects\" C-SSRS will be the first assessment scale administered \nto the subject.

The subject and/or caregiver will be prompted to \nanswer the PD Diary whether the subject has been \"ON,\" \"OFF,\" or \"ASLEEP\" and what \nhas been the severity of the dyskinesias (troublesome or not troublesome).  On PD Diary\nrecording days, subjects will be instructed to make an entry upon waking and every \n30 minutes during their normal waking time.\nStudy site staff should make a call to the subjects in advance of their clinic visit to review \nwith them the need to complete the PD Diary for the visit.\nThe PD Diary is to be recorded at the times indicated in Table 2.\nSubject Training Requirements\nDuring the initial LCIG study the subject and caregiver, if applicable, were required to \nhave diary training which included training of how to understand PD symptomatology and \nhow to complete the PD Diary.  A refresher training will be provided to the subjects and \ntheir caregivers.\nSite personnel should emphasize the importance of completing the PD Diary at half-hour \ntime points in real time during waking hours to ensure true evaluation of the subject's \ncondition.\n11.2.2 UPDRS\nThe United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an Investigator-used rating tool \nto follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease.  To be qualified by the S ponsor, Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n42\nall raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater \nCertificate.  The UPDRS is made up of the following sections:\n\u25cf Part I \u2013 Mentation, Behavior, and Mood\n\u25cf Part II \u2013 Activities of Daily Living\n\u25cf Part III \u2013 Motor Examination\n\u25cf Part IV \u2013 Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)\n\u25cf Part V \u2013 Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging\n\u25cf Part VI \u2013 Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale\nSome sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity.  UPDRS total sc ore \nranges from 0 to 176, with 176 representing the worst (total) disability, and 0 no \ndisability.  Additionally, Questions 32, 33, and 34 on UPDRS will be totaled to evaluate \ndyskinesias.  \nThe complete UPDRS (all sections) should be completed at the times indicated in Table 2.\nThe complete UPDRS will be done within 1 to 4 hours after the first morning dose of trial \nmedication during LCIG treatment.  \nUPDRS Rater Training\nThe UPDRS assessments will be administered only by individuals qualified by the \nSponsor and rater training vendor.  \nPrior to administration of respective scale(s), designated raters (Investigator or an \nexperienced and medically qualified study site designee (e.g., RN, NP, PA, DO, MD, or \nPhD) assigned by the Investigator) must be certified in the use of the UPDRS.  The \nobjective of this certification/training is to ensure uniformity across sites in the \nadministration and scoring of these assessments. \nAbbVie, in conjunction with the rater training vendor, will determine the minimum rater \nqualifications for the rating scales.  All raters must meet these qualifications prior to Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n43\nparticipation in the training process.  The qualifications of the raters will be verified \nthrough the training vendor.  Qualified raters will be certified or re-certified based on \nprior LCIG study training.  Individual exceptions to these requirements must be approved \nby the Sponsor via the training vendor.\nOnly those persons who have been trained and certified as raters for this study may rate \nthe subjects.  Raters who become involved in the study after the initial training will not be \npermitted to perform study ratings until they have satisfactorily completed an \nindividualized training program designed by the rater training vendor, approved by \nAbbVie, and supervised by the Investigator or his/her designee.  Raters may be reassessed \nperiodically throughout the study.\n11.2.3 PDQ-39\nThe Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a disease-specific instrument \ndesigned to measure aspects of health that are relevant to subjects with PD, and which \nmay not be included in general health status questionnaires.  The PDQ-39 is a \nself-administered questionnaire that comprises 39 items addressing the following \neight domains of health that subjects consider to be adversely affected by the disease:\n\u25cf Mobility (e.g., fear of falling when walking)\n\u25cf Activities of daily living (e.g., difficulty cutting food)\n\u25cf Emotional well-being (e.g., feelings of isolation)\n\u25cf Stigma (e.g., social embarrassment)\n\u25cf Social support\n\u25cf Cognition\n\u25cf Communication\n\u25cf Bodily discomfort\nThe PDQ-39 summary index ranges from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better \nperceived health status.  Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe \nsymptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.  In addition to the summary index, Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n44\nthe results can be presented as eight discrete domain scores.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended \nsign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom (including an AE \noccurring from drug abuse, an AE occurring from drug withdrawal and any failure of \nexpected pharmacological action) or disease temporally associated with the use of a \nmedicinal product or device, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or \ndevice.\nDefinition Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)\nIn the pre-approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, \nparticularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all noxious and unintended \nresponses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADRs.  The \nphrase \"response to a medicinal product\" means that a causal relationship between a \nmedicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship \ncannot be ruled out.\nRegarding marketed medicinal products:  a response to a drug which is noxious and \nunintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or \ntherapy of disease or for modification of physiological function.\nAn unexpected ADR is an ADR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the \napplicable product information, such as the Investigator's Brochure (IB).Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n49\nProduct Quality Complaint\nA Product Quality Complaint is a written, electronic or oral communication that alleges \ndeficiencies related to the identity, physical aspects, potency, expressed lack of effect \n(LOE), purity, packaging, durability, reliability, safety or performance of a product \nmanufactured by or for the Sponsor that has been placed on the market or an \ninvestigational product that is used in a clinical study, see Section 12.2.1.\nProduct Quality Complaints with regard to the medical devices (device complaints) \ninclude, but are not limited to Incidents.\nProduct Quality Complaints concerning devices, tubing and cassettes must be reported \nimmediately (within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event) by fax to \nQuintiles Pharmacovigilance, see Section 12.2.1 for the fax numbers.\nIncident\nAn Incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance \nof a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, \ndirectly or indirectly might lead or have led to the death of a subject or user or of other \npersons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.\nA serious deterioration in state of health can include:\na) Life-threatening illness\nb) Permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body \nstructure\nc) A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b) \ne.g., clinical relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure, a condition \nthat requires hospitalization or significant prolongation of existing hospitalization\nd) Fetal distress, fetal death or any congenital abnormality or birth defectsLevodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n50\nNot all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health.  The non-occurrence of \nsuch a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention \nof health care personnel.\nIt is sufficient that:\n\u25cf An Incident associated with the device happened, and\n\u25cf The Incident was such that, if it occurred again, it might lead to death or \nserious deterioration in health.\nDevice complaints which have to be reported are side effects, malfunction or deterioration \nin the characteristics and/or performance of a device, inadequacy in the labeling or the \ninstructions for use which do not fulfill the criteria of an Incident as well as use errors and \nabnormal use.\n12.1.1 Recording of Adverse Events\nAll AEs should be recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF and source documents.\nIn addition Product Quality Complaints concerning devices, cassettes, and/or LCIG \nshould be recorded on the Product Quality Complaint and Incident form, and the source \ndocuments.  Product Quality Complaints must be reported immediately (within 24 hours \nof the study site's knowledge of the event) by fax to Quintiles Pharmacovigilance \n(Pharmacovigilance fax numbers are found in Section 12.2.1).  Product Quality \nComplaints concerning devices should also be recorded on the eCRF.  Product Quality \nComplaints leading to a subject's health impairment should be recorded in the eCRF as an \nAE.\nIn order to avoid vague, ambiguous or colloquial expressions, the AE should be recorded \nin standard medical terminology rather than the subject's own words.  Whenever possible, \nthe Investigator should group together the signs and symptoms which constitute a single \ndiagnosis into a single term which reflects the actual diagnosis.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n51\nThe existence of or change in an AE may be concluded due to the necessity to administer  \na concomitant medication, from a spontaneous report of an event from the subject, from \nthe physical examination or from the results of special tests such as ECG, \nelectroencephalograms, laboratory assessments or other study- specified tests (source of \nAE).\nAEs which occur in the specified pre-treatment through the follow-up period, regardless \nof the interval prior to the first administration of the study drug or the interval since the \nlast administration of the study drug, will be handled as any other AE occurring during the \ntreatment with study drug.  Following termination of LCIG treatment, including the \nremoval of PEG-J, AEs should continue to be reported for 30 days, irrespective of the \nreason for termination (Early Termination or the end of the study).\nEach AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness and causal relationship to \nthe therapeutic system.  The action taken with the therapeutic system, the concomitant \ntreatment/therapy introduced and the outcome, as well as whether the event led to study \ntermination, will also be recorded.\nSeverity\nThe severity of the AE should be characterized as \"mild, moderate or severe\" according to \nthe following definitions:\n\u25cf Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject's daily \nactivities.\n\u25cf Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the \nsubject and may interfere with daily activities.\n\u25cf Severe events interrupt the subject's usual daily activity.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n52\nDrug-Event Relationship\nFor the assessment of drug event relationship, LCIG should be considered a therapeutic \nsystem consisting of drug, devices and implantation procedure.  Causality assessments are \nalways made over the system as a whole.\nThe causal relationship between the therapeutic system and the AE should be \ncharacterized according to the following:\n\u25cf Unrelated \u2013 there is not a reasonable possibility that the therapeutic system \ncaused the AE.\n\u25cf Unlikely \u2013 suggests that only a remote connection exists between the \ntherapeutic system and the event.  Other conditions, including concurrent \nillness, progression or expression of the disease state or reaction to \nconcomitant medication, appear to explain the AE.\n\u25cf Possible \u2013 suggests that the association of the AE with the therapeutic system \nis unknown; however, the event is not reasonably supported by other \nconditions, regardless of whether the adverse event might be related to an \nassociated condition or other concomitant treatment.\n\u25cf Probable \u2013 suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with the \ntherapeutic system exists and, in the Investigator's clinical judgment, it is \nlikely that a causal relationship exists between the therapeutic system and the \nAE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression or expression of the \ndisease state, or concomitant medication reactions) do not appear to explain \nthe AE.\nOutcome\nThe outcome of the adverse event should be classified according to the following \ndefinitions:\n\u25cf Recovered/resolved:  The event has resolved (no further symptoms are present \nand no treatment is being received by the subject).Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n53\n\u25cf Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The event has resolved, but there may be \nlingering effects present (e.g., a scar following a cut or abrasion).\n\u25cf Fatal:  The subject died as a result of the event.  This code should only be used \nfor the event that caused the death, not any event that was present at the time \nof the subject's death.  Fatal events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor \n(or an authorized representative).\n\u25cf Unknown:  May only be used in the event that the subject is lost to follow -up \nand no reliable data can be obtained.\nAll efforts should be made to classify the AE according to the above categories.\nNote:  When the AE is ongoing, the outcome will remain blank on the Adverse Events \neCRF.\n12.1.2 Follow-Up of Adverse Events\nAll AEs occurring during the study are to be followed-up in accordance with good \nmedical practice until resolved or judged no longer clinically significant, or if a chronic \ncondition, until fully characterized.  All follow-up results are to be reported to the Sponsor \n(or an authorized representative).\n12.1.3 Follow-Up of Product Quality Complaints\nThe Product Quality Complaints occurring during the study are to be followed up until \nresolved.

The expected protocol duration will continue \nthrough successful NDA and subsequent approval (approximately 4 years).  The protocol duration will \nbe extended 4 years in the UK from the approval date of Amendment 3.0 1.  If it is deemed necessary to \ncontinue treatment after 4 years in the UK, either an amendment will be made to the current protocol \nor a new protocol will be submitted.\nObjectives:\nThe primary objective is to provide continued access to subjects who would like to continue \nLevodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG), after completion of an open-label study (S187.3.003, \nS187.3.004, or any new Phase 3 open-label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor).\nMethodology:\nThis is a Phase 3B, open-label, multi-center, study.  Subjects will be provided with LCIG, if judged \nmedically indicated and if it is not commercially available.  Data collected will be limited to the \ncontinued safety monitoring of LCIG with periodic assessment of the continued appropriateness of the \nsubject's participation in the study.\nNumber of Subjects (Planned):\nIt is anticipated that approximately 275 subjects who had participated and completed one of the \nopen-label LCIG clinical trials will be eligible for this continued treatment with LCIG, until it is \ncommercially available.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n74\nDiagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet the following criteria:\n1. The subject should have completed participation in Study S187.3.003, S187.3. 004, or any new \nPhase 3 open-label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor; and, in the opinion of the Principal \nInvestigator, would benefit from long-term treatment with LCIG.  For Canada, subjects will be \nallowed to participate in the S187.3.005 study with a minimum of 6 months of exposure to LCIG in \nthe S187.3.004 study.\n2. The subject must be able to understand the nature of the study and must provide written informed \nconsent prior to the conduct of any study related procedures.\nMain Criteria for Exclusion:\nSubjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at Baseline must be excluded from \nparticipation in the study. \n1. Medical, laboratory, psychiatric, or surgical issues deemed by the Investigator to be clinically \nsignificant, and which could interfere with the subject's participation in the study.\nInvestigational Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:\nLCIG is a homogenous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa monohydrate (5 mg/mL) in an \naqueous intestinal gel (carboxymethylcellulose).  LCIG (levodopa [20 mg/mL] and carbidopa \nmonohydrate [5 mg/mL]) is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a jejunal extension tube \ninserted via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG-J).  The intestinal gel is dispensed in a \nmedication cassette reservoir of 100 mL, designed to be connected to a portable subject -operated pump.  \nLCIG infusion is administered over a full 16-hour period.  The gel will be administered as one morning \ndose, followed by continuous infusion for the remainder of the 16-hour period.  In addition to the \nmorning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects will be allowed to self-administer additional doses of \nLCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as the deterioration of motor function.  It is \nrecommended that no more than five extra doses are given per day.  If subjects find it necessary to \nself-administer an increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to \ncontact their physician for appropriate follow-up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as needed.  At \nnight, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed with potable water.\nDuration of Treatment:\nIn countries where LCIG is not commercially available, the treatment will be made available to subjects \nwho complete participation in either LCIG open-label Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004, or any new \nPhase 3 open-label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor.  Such product will be made available by the \nSponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is warranted by the therapeutic benefit.  \nThe latter will be determined in consultancy with the responsible neurologist, the subject and the \nSponsor.  Subjects who continue to receive drug will be evaluated at least semi -annually by the \nInvestigator.  In cooperation with the investigational site, all necessary support will be provided by the \nSponsor's local representatives.\nReference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:\nNot applicable.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n75\nCriteria for Evaluation:\nSafety and Tolerability Assessments:\nSafety will be assessed by:\n\uf0b7 Physical examination, including weight\n\uf0b7 Neurological examination\n\uf0b7 Vital signs\n\uf0b7 Resting ECGs\n\uf0b7 C-SSRS\n\uf0b7 Clinical laboratory assessments including biochemistry, hematology,  urinalysis, and special labs \nto monitor for vitamin deficiencies\n\uf0b7 Concomitant medication usage\n\uf0b7 Adverse event monitoring (including sleep attacks, development of impulsive behavior and of \nmelanoma)\n\uf0b7 Monitoring complications of the infusion device\nTolerability will be assessed by the number of subjects who complete the stud y.\nEfficacy Assessments (for the subject's continuity in the study):\n\uf0b7 Periodic assessment of the appropriateness for continuation in the study\n\uf0b7 The decision to continue is based on the Principal Investigator's clinical judgment\nStatistical Methods:\nThe primary statistical objective of this study will be to evaluate the long-term safety of LCIG.\nSafety Population:\nThe Safety Population includes all subjects who have taken at least one dose of study medication in this \nstudy.  The Safety Population will be used for all analyses unless noted otherwise.\nThis is an open-label study with a single, active treatment group; all subjects in this study will receive \nLCIG.\nSafety:\nThe safety population will be used for the analysis of the safety and tolerability data.\nSafety will be evaluated using adverse events (AEs), complications of the infusion device, and changes in \nlaboratory parameters, electrocardiograms, vital signs, C-SSRS and the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders \nInterview (MIDI).\nEfficacy:\nNot applicable.Levodopa-Carbidopa\nS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4\nEudraCT 2008-001329-33\n76\nHas been changed to read:\nName of Sponsor:  AbbVie Protocol Number:  S187.3.005\nName of Finished Product:  Levodopa-Carbidopa \nIntestinal Gel (LCIG) 20 mg/mL - 5mg/mL\nPhase of Development:  3\nName of Active Ingredient:  Levodopa-Carbidopa Date of Protocol Synopsis:  17 December 2013\nProtocol Title:\nOpen-Label Continuation Treatment Study with Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel in Subjects with \nAdvanced Parkinson's Disease and Severe Motor-Fluctuations Who Have Exhibited a Persistent and \nPositive Effect to Treatment in Previous Studies\nStudy Center(s) (Planned):\nApproximately 70\nStudy Duration:\nThe protocol duration is planned until the finished product is available commercially in the respective \ncountries where subjects are participating in the study.

The gel will be administered as one morning \ndose, followed by continuous infusion for the remainder of the 16-hour period.  In addition to the \nmorning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects will be allowed to self-administer additional doses of \nLCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as the deterioration of motor function.  It is \nrecommended that no more than five extra doses are given per day.  If subjects find it necessary to \nself-administer an increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to \ncontact their physician for appropriate follow-up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as needed.  At \nnight, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed with potable water.\nDuration of Treatment:\nIn countries where LCIG is not commercially available, the treatment will be made available to subjects \nwho complete participation in either LCIG open-label Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004.  Such product \nwill be made available by the Sponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is \nwarranted by the therapeutic benefit.  The latter will be determined in consultancy with the responsible \nneurologist, the subject and the Sponsor.  Subjects who continue to receive study drug will be evaluated \nat least semi-annually by the Investigator.
