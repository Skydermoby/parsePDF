The expected protocol duration will continue through successful NDA and subsequent approval (approximately 4 years).  The protocol duration will be extended 4 years in the UK from the approval date of Amendment 3.01.  If it is deemed necessary to continue treatment after 4 years in the UK, either an amendment will be made to the current protocol or a new protocol will be submitted.Objectives:The primary objective is to provide continued access to subjects who would like to continue Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG), after completion of an open-label study (S187.3.003 or S187.3.004).The secondary objectives are to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of the LCIG therapeutic system, and to assess the maintenance of efficacy using data collected from US subjects.Methodology:This is a Phase 3B, open-label, multi-center, study.  Subjects will be provided with LCIG, if judged medically indicated and if it is not commercially available.  Data collected will be for evaluation of safety and efficacy, and for periodic assessment of the continued appropriateness of the subject's participation in the study.  The decision to continue is based on the Principal Investigator's clinical judgment.Number of Subjects (Planned):It is anticipated that approximately 275 subjects who had participated and completed one of the open-label LCIG clinical trials will be eligible for this continued treatment with LCIG, until it is commercially available.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-335Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:In order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet the following criteria:1. The subject should have completed participation in Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004; and, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would benefit from long-term treatment with LCIG.  For Canada, subjects will be allowed to participate in the S187.3.005 study with a minimum of 6 months of exposure to LCIG in the S187.3.004 study.2. The subject must be able to understand the nature of the study and must provide written informed consent prior to the conduct of any study related procedures.  If the subject does not have the capacity to provide informed consent, full informed consent must be obtained from the subject's legally authorized representative.  Consenting will be performed according to local regulations.Main Criteria for Exclusion:Subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at Baseline must be excluded from participation in the study. 1. Medical, laboratory, psychiatric, or surgical issues deemed by the Investigator to be clinically significant, and which could interfere with the subject's participation in the study.Investigational Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:LCIG is a homogenous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa monohydrate (5 mg/mL) in an aqueous intestinal gel (carboxymethylcellulose).  LCIG (levodopa [20 mg/mL] and carbidopa monohydrate [5 mg/mL]) is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a jejunal extension tube inserted via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG-J).  The intestinal gel is dispensed in a medication cassette reservoir of 100 mL, designed to be connected to a portable subject-operated pump.  LCIG infusion is administered over a full 16-hour period.  The gel will be administered as one morning dose, followed by continuous infusion for the remainder of the 16-hour period.  In addition to the morning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects will be allowed to self-administer additional doses of LCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as the deterioration of motor function.  It is recommended that no more than five extra doses are given per day.  If subjects find it necessary to self-administer an increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to contact their physician for appropriate follow-up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as needed.  At night, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed with potable water.Duration of Treatment:In countries where LCIG is not commercially available, the treatment will be made available to subjects who complete participation in either LCIG open-label Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004.  Such product will be made available by the Sponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is warranted by the therapeutic benefit.  The latter will be determined in consultancy with the responsible neurologist, the subject and the Sponsor.  Subjects who continue to receive study drug will be evaluated at least semi-annually by the Investigator.  In cooperation with the investigational site, all necessary support will be provided by the Sponsor's local representatives.Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:Not applicable.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-336Criteria for Evaluation:Safety and Tolerability Assessments:Safety will be assessed by:\uf0b7 Physical examination, including weight\uf0b7 Neurological examination\uf0b7 Vital signs\uf0b7 Resting ECGs\uf0b7 C-SSRS\uf0b7 Clinical laboratory assessments including biochemistry, hematology,  urinalysis, and special labs to monitor for vitamin deficiencies\uf0b7 Concomitant medication usage\uf0b7 Adverse event monitoring (including sleep attacks, development of impulsive behavior and of melanoma)\uf0b7 Monitoring complications of the infusion deviceTolerability will be assessed by the number of subjects who complete the study.Efficacy Assessments at US Sites Only:\uf0b7 Parkinson's Disease Diary\u00a9 assessment of motor state completed for the 3 consecutive days prior to each clinic visit\uf0b7 The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)\uf0b7 Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)Statistical Methods:The primary statistical objective of this study will be to evaluate the long-term safety of LCIG.Safety Population:The Safety Population includes all subjects who have taken at least one dose of study medication in this study.Efficacy Population:The Efficacy Population includes all subjects at US sites who have taken at least one dose of study medication in this study and have at least one efficacy assessment in this study.

        "Content": "The combination of levodopa/carbidopa continues to be a mainstay in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).1-4  Levodopa relieves symptoms of PD following decarboxylation to dopamine in the brain.  Carbidopa, which does not cross the blood brain barrier, inhibits the extracerebral decarboxylation of levodopa, which means that a larger amount of levodopa becomes available for transportation to the brain and transformation into dopamine.  Without the simultaneous administration of carbidopa, much larger amounts of levodopa would be required to achieve the desired effect.In advanced stages of PD, patients treated with oral levodopa may develop s evere motor fluctuations characterized by unpredictable swings from mobility to immobility (\"on -off\" phenomenon) leading to significant difficulties in disease management.  Patients with advanced PD continue to experience significant symptoms despite an increase in the dose or frequency of oral administration of levodopa; likely, this is a combined result of the short half-life of levodopa and the unpredictable variability of gastric emptying.  Patients can also experience troublesome involuntary movements or dyskinesias during \"On\" periods so that they cycle between on periods with dyskinesia and \"Off\" periods with Parkinsonism.5  Accordingly, patients with advanced disease suffer severe disability despite current levodopa treatment.  However, there is increasing evidence that continuous infusion of levodopa can reduce both off time and dyskinesia.1,6The motor fluctuations and dyskinesias after oral intake of levodopa may be explained by an underlying progression of the disease with gradual disappearance of dopaminergic Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3316neurons in the brain.  When approaching a certain threshold of degeneration of dopaminergic and other neurons, an individuals' capacity to store dopamine in the brain and ability to respond to levodopa becomes increasingly unstable.  It has been hypothesized that the therapeutic plasma levodopa concentration window becomes increasingly narrow over time.  As a result there is an insufficient response (Parkinsonism) when the levodopa concentration is below the window, and troublesome dyskinesias occur when the concentration increases above an upper threshold for the individual.  The incidence of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias among patients treated with oral levodopa/carbidopa varies between 20% and 50% of the patients in different studies.3,4Various approaches have been taken to cope with the increasingly unstable levodopa response.  Manipulations of levodopa dose are typically not effective.  Dopamine agonists may be of some value, but are not adequate in advanced cases.  Oral formulations of levodopa are often prescribed in combination with long-acting dopamine agonists and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors.7  However, despite individually optimizing treatment with these conventional medications, patients with advanced PD often do not experience adequate control of their motor performance.  Therefore, additional treatment strategies are needed for these patients.  A number of approaches have been explored and utilized with varying degrees of success; they include the continuous intravenous (IV) administration of levodopa1,8-10 and deep brain stimulation (DBS).11  Due to issues of technical and logistic feasibility, continuous administration of intravenous (IV) levodopa has not received wide application.  DBS has been used in the treatment of advanced PD patients and has demonstrated improvement of motor fluctuations in this patient population, but severe complications have been reported in a substantial number of patients; the procedure is not available in all settings, it is expensive, and not all PD patients are candidates for brain surgery.12Almost three decades ago, it was clearly demonstrated that constant-rate delivery (infusion) of levodopa to the blood markedly stabilized motor performance in advanced PD patients.9,10,13Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3317LCIG is a suspension of levodopa:carbidopa (4:1) in an aqueous gel (carboxymethylcellulose) with a viscosity that permits homogeneous distribution of micronized substance particles.  On upper-intestinal administration, the compounds are dissolved in situ and levodopa is rapidly absorbed by an active carrier mechanism localized in the proximal small intestine.  LCIG provides continuous rather than intermittent stimulation of the dopaminergic receptors in the brain by permitting plasma concentrations of levodopa to be kept within the individual's therapeutic window.  When delivered via continuous intestinal infusion therapy, LCIG reduces the motor fluctuations and increases the \"On\"-time for patients with advanced PD who have received oral tablet treatment with levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor for many years.  The motor fluctuations and hyper-/dyskinesias are reduced when plasma concentrations of levodopa are kept within the individual therapeutic window.  Therapeutic effects on motor fluctuations and hyper-/dyskinesias are often achieved during the first treatment day.The delivery of LCIG directly to the proximal small intestine is anticipated to result in the following:1,2,13,14\u25cf Continuous delivery of levodopa-carbidopa\u25cf Avoidance of the effects of pulsatile gastric emptying\u25cf Reduced variability in plasma-levodopa concentrations\u25cf Decreased motor fluctuations and dyskinesiasLCIG is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a catheter inserted via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy \u2013 with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J).  The LCIG is dispensed in medication cassette reservoirs.  The contents of the medication cassette reservoir are delivered via continuous administration as illustrated in Figure 1.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3318Figure 1. Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel Infusion SystemThe principle aim of LCIG treatment is to continuously infuse levodopa and carbidopa directly into the proximal small intestine (the duodenum and/or jejunum), where it is absorbed by a carrier-mediated mechanism.  Absorption problems related to erratic gastricemptying, early metabolism, and competitive inhibition of intestinal absorption by large neutral amino acids will be markedly reduced allowing levodopa to be rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream.  It has been demonstrated that an upper-intestinal infusion of levodopa is associated with reduced variability in plasma levodopa concentrations as compared to oral formulations of levodopa/carbidopa.13The efficacy of upper-intestinal administration of levodopa has been demonstrated in clinical investigations by decreasing motor fluctuations compared to standard oral therapy.  Results of a 3-week open-label cross-over study (NPP-001-02), with blinded assessments of efficacy, demonstrated clinical and statistical superiority of LCIG compared to standard oral therapy with regard to motor fluctuations.2,15  Patients also reported significantly improved scores in two Quality of Life (QoL) instruments, the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and EuroQol Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D).2This open-label, multi-center, Phase 3B study will provide continued treatment with LCIG to subjects who have already participated in an open-label treatment study with the same treatment (S187.3.003 or S187.3.004).  In countries where LCIG is not yet available Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3319commercially, the treatment will be made available by the Sponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is warranted by the therapeutic benefit.  The latter will be determined in consultancy with the responsible neurologist, the subject and the Sponsor.  Subjects who continue to receive study drug will be evaluated at least semi-annually by the Investigator.  In cooperation with the investigational site, all necessary support will be provided by the Sponsor's local representatives.  Additionally, the study will allow for observation of the long-term safety, tolerability, and maintenance of efficacy of LCIG administered for several years in a more naturalistic treatment environment."

                "Content": "This is a Phase 3B, open-label, multi-center study of the long-term safety and tolerability of LCIG in the continuation of treatment of approximately 275 advanced Parkinson's disease subjects with a good therapeutic response on LCIG with regard to the treatment of persistent severe motor fluctuations.  The study will be conducted at approximately 70 centers.  In addition, maintenance of efficacy will be evaluated at approximately 28 US sites.Only subjects who have completed Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004 will qualify for enrollment in this study.  Following informed consent, subjects will have their inclusion/exclusion criteria assessed prior to beginning treatment in this study.  Subjects are allowed to have a caregiver, if appropriate, assist them with study requirements, Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3321i.e., care of the pump and tubing, etc. and the caregiver will have been trained accordingly.The initial LCIG dose will be identical to the dose that the subject was receiving at the end of the previous open-label LCIG study.  Subsequent dose adjustments will be made as clinically indicated by the Investigator.In this open-label study, a recommendation will be made to Investigators to withhold concomitant PD treatments if deemed medically safe and clinically appropriate.  The initiation of additional PD medication may be medically indicated and is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator.  Also, the dosages of these other PD medications can be adjusted upward or downward as needed based on the status of the subject's condition or the development of adverse effects; resumption of discontinued PD medications may also be necessary.In addition to the morning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects will be allowed to self-administer additional doses of LCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as the deterioration of motor function.  If subjects find it necessary to self-administer an increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to contact the Investigator for appropriate follow-up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as needed. Subject visit days should ideally match the target clinic visit days; however, a 14 -day visit window will be allowed as necessary.  Attempt should be made to bring the subj ect back on the target visit day.The final visit in the previous open-label LCIG study will provide baseline assessments for the S1878.3.005 study.  Subjects will be reassessed every 6 months for the appropriateness of the continuation of treatment with LCIG.  If the subject is deemed inappropriate for continued treatment by the Investigator, the subject would be discontinued from treatment and the PEG-J will be removed, with a follow-up visit Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3322occurring 1 week later.  For subjects who elect not to continue LCIG treatment, the PEG-J will be removed, and a follow-up clinic visit will occur 1 week later.Safety assessments should include physical examination, neurological exam, orthostatic vital signs, weight, adverse event monitoring, assessment of impulsive behavior and sleep attacks, melanoma check, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical hematology, biochemistry, special labs to monitor for vitamin deficiencies, and urinalysis.The following efficacy assessments will be completed at US sites: \u25cf Parkinson's Disease Diary\u00a9 assessment of motor state completed for the 3 consecutive days prior to each clinic visit (excluding the drug dispensation visits),\u25cf Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and \u25cf Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39).At each visit, complications or adverse events with the infusion device (i.e., the tubing system and the pump) will also be recorded and reported.  Tube placement will be checked by radiography if there is a clinical indication that the tube has been displaced.  The tube will be repositioned, if needed, to the original placement site just beyond the ligament of Treitz.  At each visit the tube insertion site, including the stoma, will also be inspected.  On a yearly basis, at a minimum, an assessment will be made of the need for a replacement of the PEG-J.  The frequency of replacement should be in accordance with local practice.The protocol duration is planned until the finished product is available commercially in the respective countries where subjects are participating in the study.  The expected protocol duration will continue through successful NDA and subsequent approval (approximately 4 years).  The protocol duration will be extended 4 years in the UK from the approval date of Amendment 3.01.  If it is deemed necessary to continue treatment after 4 years in the UK, either an amendment to the current protocol will be made or a new protocol will be submitted.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3323"

No restrictions are given with relation to the time of dosing relative to meals.10.6.1 LCIG InfusionThe total dose/day of LCIG is composed of three individually adjusted doses:  the morning dose, the continuous maintenance dose and extra doses The infusion dose will continue to be individually optimized for each subject during the study, by the Investigator, based on response and potential adverse events.  The rate of infusion is expected to be within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances.  The infusion will run over approximately 16 hours.  The PEG-J is to be disconnected from the infusion pump at bedtime.  Extra doses of LCIG can be used to help control fluctuations in the subject's PD symptoms.Morning Dose:The morning dose is administered as a bolus infusion by the pump to fill the dead space of the intestinal tube and rapidly achieve the therapeutic dose level (within 10 to 30 minutes).  The total morning dose is usually 5 to 10 mL, corresponding to 100 to 200 mg levodopa.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3329The total morning dose will usually not exceed 15 mL (300 mg levodopa).  However, there may be some exceptions to these recommendations based on the Investigator's clinical judgment.Continuous Maintenance Dose:The maintenance dose is adjustable in steps of 2 mg/hour (0.1 mL/hour).  When supplementary medicines are discontinued or added to the treatment regimen, the LCIG dose should be adjusted.  The continuous maintenance dose is adjusted individually.  It should be kept within a range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg levodopa/hour) and is usually 2 to 6 mL/hour (40 to 120 mg levodopa/hour).  In exceptional cases, a higher dose may be needed based on the Investigator's clinical judgment.Example:Daily intake of levodopa as LCIG:  1640 mg/dayMorning dose: 140 mg = 7 mLContinuous maintenance dose thereafter:  1500 mg/day1500 mg/day at 20 mg/mL = 75 mL LCIG per dayThe intake is calculated over 16 hours:  75 mL/16 hours = 4.7 mL/hour.Extra Infusion Doses:Subjects will be allowed to self-administer extra doses of LCIG to address immediate medical needs, such as the rapid deterioration of motor function.  Extra doses may be given as required if the subject becomes hypokinetic during the day.  The extra dose should be adjusted individually, normally 0.5 to 2.0 mL.  In rare cases, a higher dose may be needed.  If the need for extra doses exceeds five per day, consideration should be given to increasing the maintenance dose.  Additionally, fine adjustments of the morning dose, the maintenance dose and extra doses can be made as needed.During treatment, Investigator consideration should be given to instances in which deterioration of treatment response occurs.  In the absence of pump alarm notifications, a sudden deterioration in treatment response with recurring motor fluctuations could be the Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3330result of the distal part of the tube becoming displaced from the upper intestine into the stomach.  The location of the tube should be determined radiographically.  If necessary, the end of the tube can be repositioned to the proximal small intestine and the new placement confirmed radiographically.The tube insertion site, including the stoma, should be inspected at each Study Visit.10.6.2 Post LCIG Infusion Night-Time TreatmentFollowing the discontinuation of the 16-hour LCIG infusion, subjects will be permitted to self administer their typical night-time regimen of levodopa-carbidopa tablets (typical evening and night-time doses of oral levodopa-carbidopa that they take on a regular basis).   10.6.3 Oral Rescue MedicationOral levodopa-carbidopa medication may only be used to supplement treatment at night and should NOT be used during the day, except as rescue medication in case of acute deterioration presumably caused by failure of the LCIG system such as tubes and/or the pump or the onset of an acute illness.  Extra doses of LCIG should be utilized for these symptoms during the LCIG infusion.Subjects should have a supply of oral levodopa-carbidopa IR if for some reason they are unable to administer their LCIG infusion.Oral doses of levodopa-carbidopa taken after the discontinuation of daily LCIG infusion (typical evening and night-time doses of oral levodopa-carbidopa taken on a regular basis) will not be counted as rescue medication, as long as the number of tablets taken during that period does not exceed what the subject routinely takes during those hours.  If the subject requires additional oral doses beyond the routine number of tablets of levodopa-carbidopa that are needed as part of the subject's typical night-time regimen, these additional oral doses should be considered rescue doses.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3331"

AnticholinergicsAnticholinergics may act synergistically with levodopa to decrease tremor.  However, combined use may exacerbate abnormal involuntary movements.  Anticholinergics may decrease the effects of levodopa by delaying its absorption.  An adjustment of the dose of LCIG may be needed.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3332COMT Inhibitors (tolcapone, entacapone)Concomitant use of COMT (Catechol-O-Methyl Transferase) inhibitors and LCIG can increase the bioavailability of levodopa.  The dose of LCIG may need adjustment.Other Medicinal ProductsDopamine receptor antagonists (some antipsychotics, e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenons and risperidone and antiemetics, e.g., metoclopramide), benzodiazepines, isoniazide, phenytoin and papaverine can reduce the therapeutic effect of levodopa.  Subjects taking these medicinal products together with LCIG should be observed carefully for loss of therapeutic response.LCIG can be taken concomitantly with the recommended dose of a selective MAO type B inhibitor (for instance selegiline-HCl).  However, concomitant use of selegiline and levodopa-carbidopa has been associated with serious orthostatic hypotension.Amantadine has synergic effect with levodopa and may increase levodopa related adverse events.  An adjustment of the dose of LCIG may be needed.Sympathicomimetics may increase cardiovascular adverse events related to levodop a.Levodopa forms a chelate with iron in the gastrointestinal tract leading to reduced absorption of levodopa."

Each subject is to be evaluated at the Early Termination/End of Study visit.  Should any AE be identified at this visit, the Investigator will continue to follow the subject as described in Section 12.1.2.11.1.2 Sleep AttacksTo prospectively monitor for the possible development of sleep attacks the following question will be asked of subjects at the times indicated in Table 2:Since your last visit or last time this question was asked, have you experienced any events in which you fell asleep suddenly or unexpectedly, including while engaged in some activity (e.g., eating/drinking, speaking, or driving) or a rest, with or without any previous warning of sleepiness?\u25cf If yes, what specifically happened?\u25cf How man y times did you experience such events?\u25cf What were you doing at the time of each event?Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3335\u25cf Prior to each event did you experience any sleepiness or drowsiness?  If yes, please explain/clarify.\u25cf How long did each event last?\u25cf Did you suffer any \"bad\" outcome/problem from each falling asleep event?11.1.3 Assessment for MelanomaA comprehensive assessment for the presence of melanoma must be performed at yearly intervals, including at the Early Termination/End of Study, by a dermatologist experienced with the diagnosis of the condition.  If a suspicious lesion is present, a biopsy should be obtained for proper diagnosis and subjects should be referred to appropriate follow-up treatment, if necessary.  Subjects who have a melanoma present at the start of the study, or who develop a melanoma during the course of the study should be discontinued from participation and referred for proper follow-up care.11.1.4 Assessment of Impulsive BehaviorTo monitor for the development of intense impulsive behavior, the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (MIDI) will be administered at 6 month intervals during the course of the subject's involvement in the study, and at the time of the subjects' termination from the study.  In addition, the Investigator should ask the subjects to inform him/her immediately if they experience new or increased gambling urges, increased sexual urges, or other intense urges while taking LCIG.If the subject's impulsivity is judged to be clinically significant, in the judgment of the Investigator, the subject will be discontinued from participation in the study and referred for appropriate follow-up care.The General Information and Background Module sections of the MIDI do not need to be completed.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-333611.1.5 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)16 is a systematically administered instrument developed to track suicidal adverse events across a treatment study.  The instrument is designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed include frequency, duration, controllability, reason for ideation, and deterrents.  The C-SSRS is considered a low-burden instrument, as it takes less than 5 minutes to administer.  Raters will receive instruction on the administration of the C-SSRS assessment scales prior to administration of the scales.  The C-SSRS will be administered at the times outlined in Table 2.Subjects expressing suicidal ideation with plan, either by answering \"yes\" to questions 4 and/or 5 to the suicidal ideation portion of the C-SSRS or via clinical interview, will be evaluated immediately by the Investigator or another medically qualified individual (M.D., D.O.).  The Medical Monitor must be notified and the subject will be discontinued from participation in the study.  The subject will be referred for appropriate psychiatric follow-up treatment, if necessary, per the judgment of the Investigator or the medically qualified individual.  The Medical Monitor will also be notified.  In addition, if the subject expresses suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior at any time during the course of the study, the subject should be discontinued from participation in the study and referred for proper psychiatric follow-up care.  The Investigator and the Medical Monitor should be notified immediately as well. Under no circumstances should a subject who has positively endorsed or expressed suicidal ideation or behavior be left alone, be allowed to exit the site, or go home before a qualified medical professional has evaluated the subject's risk.The \"Already Enrolled Subjects\" C-SSRS will be the first assessment scale administered to the subject.  At each subsequent assessment, the \"Since Last Visit\" C-SSRS scale should be administered.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3337If the subject has previously completed the \"Already Enrolled Subjects\" scale in the S187.3.003 study, the subject should complete the \"Since Last Visit\" scale at all scheduled time points outlined in Table 2 in this study.  For subjects with a C-SSRS completed at their S187.3.003 final visit, that S187.3.003 final visit C-SSRS assessment will be considered baseline for the S187.3.005 study.  For all other subjects, the first C-SSRS assessment completed in this study will serve as baseline.11.1.6 Vital SignsOrthostatic vital signs including pulse, blood pressure, and body temperature will be measured at the times indicated in Table 2.  Temperature measurements should be assessed by a consistent method (e.g. all oral or all ear [tympanic membrane] measurements) and by the same method as baseline, if baseline is available.  Weight will be measured at the times indicated in Table 2.Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and pulse rate are to be measured while the subject is supine (after 3 to 5 minutes) and standing (after 2 minutes).11.1.7 Physical ExaminationA physical exam as per usual practice will be performed at 6 month intervals, and at the time of the subjects' termination from the study.  Any relevant findings are to be recorded on the Adverse Events Form in the eCRF.11.1.8 Neurological ExaminationA Neurologic Examination including light touch and pinprick sensation, vibratory sensation, deep tendon reflexes, and strength assessments will be performed at the times indicated in Table 2.  The Neurologic Examination will be done during \"On\" time.Any abnormalities or symptoms identified during treatment will be recorded as adverse events.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3338The neurological examination will assess:\u25cf Cranial nerves \u2013 assessment of cranial nerves II\u2013XII, excluding fundoscopic examination\u25cf Motor system \u2013 assessment of tone, strength and abnormal movements\u25cf Sensory system \u2013 including light touch, pinprick, joint position and vibratory sense\u25cf Reflexes \u2013 assessment of deep tendon reflexes and plantar responses (Babinski sign)\u25cf Coordination \u2013 assessment of upper and lower extremities\u25cf Gait \u2013 assessment of base and tandem gait\u25cf Station \u2013 assessment of posture and stability11.1.9 Laboratory EvaluationsThe laboratory evaluations listed in Table 1, including special tests for vitamin deficiencies (Folic Acid, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Methylmalonic Acid (MMA), and Homocysteine) will be performed by a central laboratory to be designated by Sponsor, at the times indicated in Table 2.

The subject and/or caregiver will be prompted to answer the PD Diary whether the subject has been \"ON,\" \"OFF,\" or \"ASLEEP\" and what has been the severity of the dyskinesias (troublesome or not troublesome).  On PD Diaryrecording days, subjects will be instructed to make an entry upon waking and every 30 minutes during their normal waking time.Study site staff should make a call to the subjects in advance of their clinic visit to review with them the need to complete the PD Diary for the visit.The PD Diary is to be recorded at the times indicated in Table 2.Subject Training RequirementsDuring the initial LCIG study the subject and caregiver, if applicable, were required to have diary training which included training of how to understand PD symptomatology and how to complete the PD Diary.  A refresher training will be provided to the subjects and their caregivers.Site personnel should emphasize the importance of completing the PD Diary at half-hour time points in real time during waking hours to ensure true evaluation of the subject's condition.11.2.2 UPDRSThe United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease.  To be qualified by the S ponsor, Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3342all raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater Certificate.  The UPDRS is made up of the following sections:\u25cf Part I \u2013 Mentation, Behavior, and Mood\u25cf Part II \u2013 Activities of Daily Living\u25cf Part III \u2013 Motor Examination\u25cf Part IV \u2013 Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)\u25cf Part V \u2013 Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging\u25cf Part VI \u2013 Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living ScaleSome sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity.  UPDRS total sc ore ranges from 0 to 176, with 176 representing the worst (total) disability, and 0 no disability.  Additionally, Questions 32, 33, and 34 on UPDRS will be totaled to evaluate dyskinesias.  The complete UPDRS (all sections) should be completed at the times indicated in Table 2.The complete UPDRS will be done within 1 to 4 hours after the first morning dose of trial medication during LCIG treatment.  UPDRS Rater TrainingThe UPDRS assessments will be administered only by individuals qualified by the Sponsor and rater training vendor.  Prior to administration of respective scale(s), designated raters (Investigator or an experienced and medically qualified study site designee (e.g., RN, NP, PA, DO, MD, or PhD) assigned by the Investigator) must be certified in the use of the UPDRS.  The objective of this certification/training is to ensure uniformity across sites in the administration and scoring of these assessments. AbbVie, in conjunction with the rater training vendor, will determine the minimum rater qualifications for the rating scales.  All raters must meet these qualifications prior to Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3343participation in the training process.  The qualifications of the raters will be verified through the training vendor.  Qualified raters will be certified or re-certified based on prior LCIG study training.  Individual exceptions to these requirements must be approved by the Sponsor via the training vendor.Only those persons who have been trained and certified as raters for this study may rate the subjects.  Raters who become involved in the study after the initial training will not be permitted to perform study ratings until they have satisfactorily completed an individualized training program designed by the rater training vendor, approved by AbbVie, and supervised by the Investigator or his/her designee.  Raters may be reassessed periodically throughout the study.11.2.3 PDQ-39The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure aspects of health that are relevant to subjects with PD, and which may not be included in general health status questionnaires.  The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire that comprises 39 items addressing the following eight domains of health that subjects consider to be adversely affected by the disease:\u25cf Mobility (e.g., fear of falling when walking)\u25cf Activities of daily living (e.g., difficulty cutting food)\u25cf Emotional well-being (e.g., feelings of isolation)\u25cf Stigma (e.g., social embarrassment)\u25cf Social support\u25cf Cognition\u25cf Communication\u25cf Bodily discomfortThe PDQ-39 summary index ranges from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status.  Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.  In addition to the summary index, Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3344the results can be presented as eight discrete domain scores.

The phrase \"response to a medicinal product\" means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.Regarding marketed medicinal products:  a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for modification of physiological function.An unexpected ADR is an ADR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information, such as the Investigator's Brochure (IB).Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3349Product Quality ComplaintA Product Quality Complaint is a written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, physical aspects, potency, expressed lack of effect (LOE), purity, packaging, durability, reliability, safety or performance of a product manufactured by or for the Sponsor that has been placed on the market or an investigational product that is used in a clinical study, see Section 12.2.1.Product Quality Complaints with regard to the medical devices (device complaints) include, but are not limited to Incidents.Product Quality Complaints concerning devices, tubing and cassettes must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event) by fax to Quintiles Pharmacovigilance, see Section 12.2.1 for the fax numbers.IncidentAn Incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly might lead or have led to the death of a subject or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.A serious deterioration in state of health can include:a) Life-threatening illnessb) Permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structurec) A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b) e.g., clinical relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure, a condition that requires hospitalization or significant prolongation of existing hospitalizationd) Fetal distress, fetal death or any congenital abnormality or birth defectsLevodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3350Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health.  The non-occurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel.It is sufficient that:\u25cf An Incident associated with the device happened, and\u25cf The Incident was such that, if it occurred again, it might lead to death or serious deterioration in health.Device complaints which have to be reported are side effects, malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which do not fulfill the criteria of an Incident as well as use errors and abnormal use.12.1.1 Recording of Adverse EventsAll AEs should be recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF and source documents.In addition Product Quality Complaints concerning devices, cassettes, and/or LCIG should be recorded on the Product Quality Complaint and Incident form, and the source documents.  Product Quality Complaints must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event) by fax to Quintiles Pharmacovigilance (Pharmacovigilance fax numbers are found in Section 12.2.1).  Product Quality Complaints concerning devices should also be recorded on the eCRF.  Product Quality Complaints leading to a subject's health impairment should be recorded in the eCRF as an AE.In order to avoid vague, ambiguous or colloquial expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the subject's own words.  Whenever possible, the Investigator should group together the signs and symptoms which constitute a single diagnosis into a single term which reflects the actual diagnosis.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3351The existence of or change in an AE may be concluded due to the necessity to administer  a concomitant medication, from a spontaneous report of an event from the subject, from the physical examination or from the results of special tests such as ECG, electroencephalograms, laboratory assessments or other study- specified tests (source of AE).AEs which occur in the specified pre-treatment through the follow-up period, regardless of the interval prior to the first administration of the study drug or the interval since the last administration of the study drug, will be handled as any other AE occurring during the treatment with study drug.  Following termination of LCIG treatment, including the removal of PEG-J, AEs should continue to be reported for 30 days, irrespective of the reason for termination (Early Termination or the end of the study).Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness and causal relationship to the therapeutic system.  The action taken with the therapeutic system, the concomitant treatment/therapy introduced and the outcome, as well as whether the event led to study termination, will also be recorded.SeverityThe severity of the AE should be characterized as \"mild, moderate or severe\" according to the following definitions:\u25cf Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject's daily activities.\u25cf Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities.\u25cf Severe events interrupt the subject's usual daily activity.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3352Drug-Event RelationshipFor the assessment of drug event relationship, LCIG should be considered a therapeutic system consisting of drug, devices and implantation procedure.  Causality assessments are always made over the system as a whole.The causal relationship between the therapeutic system and the AE should be characterized according to the following:\u25cf Unrelated \u2013 there is not a reasonable possibility that the therapeutic system caused the AE.\u25cf Unlikely \u2013 suggests that only a remote connection exists between the therapeutic system and the event.  Other conditions, including concurrent illness, progression or expression of the disease state or reaction to concomitant medication, appear to explain the AE.\u25cf Possible \u2013 suggests that the association of the AE with the therapeutic system is unknown; however, the event is not reasonably supported by other conditions, regardless of whether the adverse event might be related to an associated condition or other concomitant treatment.\u25cf Probable \u2013 suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with the therapeutic system exists and, in the Investigator's clinical judgment, it is likely that a causal relationship exists between the therapeutic system and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression or expression of the disease state, or concomitant medication reactions) do not appear to explain the AE.OutcomeThe outcome of the adverse event should be classified according to the following definitions:\u25cf Recovered/resolved:  The event has resolved (no further symptoms are present and no treatment is being received by the subject).Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3353\u25cf Recovered/resolved with sequelae:  The event has resolved, but there may be lingering effects present (e.g., a scar following a cut or abrasion).\u25cf Fatal:  The subject died as a result of the event.  This code should only be used for the event that caused the death, not any event that was present at the time of the subject's death.  Fatal events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).\u25cf Unknown:  May only be used in the event that the subject is lost to follow -up and no reliable data can be obtained.All efforts should be made to classify the AE according to the above categories.Note:  When the AE is ongoing, the outcome will remain blank on the Adverse Events eCRF.12.1.2 Follow-Up of Adverse EventsAll AEs occurring during the study are to be followed-up in accordance with good medical practice until resolved or judged no longer clinically significant, or if a chronic condition, until fully characterized.  All follow-up results are to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).12.1.3 Follow-Up of Product Quality ComplaintsThe Product Quality Complaints occurring during the study are to be followed up until resolved.  All follow-up results are to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).12.1.4 Adverse Events of Special InterestAdverse events of special interest (AESI) for LCIG are:\u25cf Risks of PEG-J insertion\u25cf Long-term complications of PEG-J\u25cf Device associated gastrointestinal disorders during long-term therapyLevodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3354\u25cf Cardiovascular fatalities\u25cf Aspiration including aspiration pneumonia\u25cf A diagnosis of peripheral polyneuropathy; axonal, demyelinating or mixed type\u25cf Possible symptoms of peripheral polyneuropathy such as sensory disturbances or loss of strength, which from their course and clinical presentation or from their response to medication could be precursors of polyneuropathy\u25cf Clinically significant weight lossA standard panel of examinations will be suggested to the Investigators if one of the study subjects develops signs and symptoms of polyneuropathy.  The panel should be considered as a basic recommendation and the selection of additional diagnostic tools is at the discretion of the Investigator, depending on the clinical presentation of the individual subject.For AESIs, serious and nonserious, meeting pre-defined criteria, specific questionnaires will be used to standardize the collection of follow-up information.All cases of clinically significant weight loss and possible symptoms or precursors of polyneuropathy (serious and non serious) should be reported on the Report for SAEs and AESIs (Yellow Form) to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) within the expedited timelines applicable for SAEs."

These should also be considered serious.Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.During the course of the study:If not associated with significant worsening of PD symptoms, a hospitalization for dose adjustments of LCIG will not be regarded as an SAE.  A hospitalization because of a Product Quality Complaint such as a device dislocation without AE (i.e., wit hout health impairment) will not be regarded as an SAE.12.2.1 Reporting Serious Adverse EventsAny SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this study, whether or not related to the therapeutic system, must be reported immediately (within 24 ho urs of the study site's knowledge of the event) by telephone or fax to the Sponsor or the Sponsor's authorized representative (phone or fax numbers are listed below).Additionally, Product Quality Complaints concerning devices and cassettes must also be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event) by fax to Quintiles Pharmacovigilance at the following numbers:Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3356Quintiles Pharmacovigilance toll free numbers:Australia Phone: 1 800 142 945 Fax:  1 800 142 946Israel Phone:  809452016 Fax:  1 80 945 201Italy Phone:  800 8 747 41 Fax:  800 8 747 51New Zealand Phone:  0 800 44 5044 Fax:  0 800 44 5043Poland Phone:  00 800 353 1 203 Fax:  00 800 353 1 204Portugal Phone:  800 85 32 08 Fax:  800 85 32 09Russia Phone:  AT&T access code 363 2400 (Moscow) or 8 pause 495 363 2400 (Outside Moscow) or 8 pause 812 363 2400 (Outside St. Petersburg) or  8 + pause + 10-800-110-1011 (all other places)+ Pause+ Phone #:  877 264 10 40Fax:  AT&T access code 363 2400 (Moscow) or 8 pause 495 363 2400 (Outside Moscow) or 8 pause 812 363 2400 (Outside St. Petersburg) or 8 + pause + 10-800-110-1011 (all other places)+ Pause+ Fax #:  877 264 10 39Thailand AT&T access code 001 999 111 11 or 1 800 001 33 Phone:  877 264 10 40Fax:  877 264 10 39UK Phone:  0 800 834 450 Fax:  0 800 132 079US and Canada Phone:  866 366-9790 Fax:  866 490-2648Quintiles Pharmacovigilance non-toll free number:All Ex-US countries Phone:  00 353 1 819 55 11 Fax:  00 353 1 809 9501The report will contain as much available information concerning the SAE and/or Product Quality Complaint to enable the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) to file a report that satisfies regulatory reporting requirements.

Criteria for documenting the relationship to the therapeutic system as well as severity and outcome will be the same as those previously described.All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within 30 days of a subject's last visit are to be collected and reported as previously described.12.2.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Drug Reactions and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Drug Reactions to Regulatory Authorities and InvestigatorsAll serious adverse drug reactions will be subject to expedited reporting per local requirements and regulations.  All suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reactions (SUSARs) will be subject to expedited reporting and any additional local requirements and regulations.  Additionally, post-study SUSARs that occur after the subject has completed a clinical study and are reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) qualify for expedited reporting.  Expectedness is assessed according to the Investigator's Brochure (IB) for LCIG.14The Sponsor (or an authorized representative) is responsible for submitting reports of SUSARs to the appropriate national regulatory authorities within the required reporting period.  All Investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with the therapeutic system will be notified by the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) of all SUSARs that require prompt submission to the IEC/IRB.  The Sponsor (or an autho rized representative) or the Investigator (according to national provisions) is responsible for notifying the IECs/IRBs in writing of the SUSARs within the required reporting timelines.  Copies of the notification will be maintained by both the Investigator and the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) in the study documentation files.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3358"

The expected protocol duration will continue through successful NDA and subsequent approval (approximately 4 years).  The protocol duration will be extended 4 years in the UK from the approval date of Amendment 3.0 1.  If it is deemed necessary to continue treatment after 4 years in the UK, either an amendment will be made to the current protocol or a new protocol will be submitted.Objectives:The primary objective is to provide continued access to subjects who would like to continue Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG), after completion of an open-label study (S187.3.003, S187.3.004, or any new Phase 3 open-label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor).Methodology:This is a Phase 3B, open-label, multi-center, study.  Subjects will be provided with LCIG, if judged medically indicated and if it is not commercially available.  Data collected will be limited to the continued safety monitoring of LCIG with periodic assessment of the continued appropriateness of the subject's participation in the study.Number of Subjects (Planned):It is anticipated that approximately 275 subjects who had participated and completed one of the open-label LCIG clinical trials will be eligible for this continued treatment with LCIG, until it is commercially available.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3374Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:In order to be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must meet the following criteria:1. The subject should have completed participation in Study S187.3.003, S187.3. 004, or any new Phase 3 open-label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor; and, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would benefit from long-term treatment with LCIG.  For Canada, subjects will be allowed to participate in the S187.3.005 study with a minimum of 6 months of exposure to LCIG in the S187.3.004 study.2. The subject must be able to understand the nature of the study and must provide written informed consent prior to the conduct of any study related procedures.Main Criteria for Exclusion:Subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at Baseline must be excluded from participation in the study. 1. Medical, laboratory, psychiatric, or surgical issues deemed by the Investigator to be clinically significant, and which could interfere with the subject's participation in the study.Investigational Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:LCIG is a homogenous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa monohydrate (5 mg/mL) in an aqueous intestinal gel (carboxymethylcellulose).  LCIG (levodopa [20 mg/mL] and carbidopa monohydrate [5 mg/mL]) is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a jejunal extension tube inserted via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG-J).  The intestinal gel is dispensed in a medication cassette reservoir of 100 mL, designed to be connected to a portable subject -operated pump.  LCIG infusion is administered over a full 16-hour period.  The gel will be administered as one morning dose, followed by continuous infusion for the remainder of the 16-hour period.  In addition to the morning dose and the continuous infusion, subjects will be allowed to self-administer additional doses of LCIG to address immediate subjective needs, such as the deterioration of motor function.  It is recommended that no more than five extra doses are given per day.  If subjects find it necessary to self-administer an increasing number of extra doses (> five/day) of LCIG, they will be instructed to contact their physician for appropriate follow-up care (adjustment of continuous infusion) as needed.  At night, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed with potable water.Duration of Treatment:In countries where LCIG is not commercially available, the treatment will be made available to subjects who complete participation in either LCIG open-label Study S187.3.003 or S187.3.004, or any new Phase 3 open-label LCIG study initiated by the Sponsor.  Such product will be made available by the Sponsor in accordance with all local regulations as long as such is warranted by the therapeutic benefit.  The latter will be determined in consultancy with the responsible neurologist, the subject and the Sponsor.  Subjects who continue to receive drug will be evaluated at least semi -annually by the Investigator.  In cooperation with the investigational site, all necessary support will be provided by the Sponsor's local representatives.Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:Not applicable.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3375Criteria for Evaluation:Safety and Tolerability Assessments:Safety will be assessed by:\uf0b7 Physical examination, including weight\uf0b7 Neurological examination\uf0b7 Vital signs\uf0b7 Resting ECGs\uf0b7 C-SSRS\uf0b7 Clinical laboratory assessments including biochemistry, hematology,  urinalysis, and special labs to monitor for vitamin deficiencies\uf0b7 Concomitant medication usage\uf0b7 Adverse event monitoring (including sleep attacks, development of impulsive behavior and of melanoma)\uf0b7 Monitoring complications of the infusion deviceTolerability will be assessed by the number of subjects who complete the stud y.Efficacy Assessments (for the subject's continuity in the study):\uf0b7 Periodic assessment of the appropriateness for continuation in the study\uf0b7 The decision to continue is based on the Principal Investigator's clinical judgmentStatistical Methods:The primary statistical objective of this study will be to evaluate the long-term safety of LCIG.Safety Population:The Safety Population includes all subjects who have taken at least one dose of study medication in this study.

The subject and/or caregiver will be prompted to answer the PD Diary whether the subject has been \"ON,\" \"OFF,\" or \"ASLEEP\" and what has been the severity of the dyskinesias (troublesome or not troublesome).  On PD Diary Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3390recording days, subjects will be instructed to make an entry upon waking and every 30 minutes during their normal waking time.Study site staff should make a call to the subjects in advance of their clinic visit to review with them the need to complete the PD Diary for the visit.The PD Diary is to be recorded at the times indicated in Table 2.Subject Training RequirementsDuring the initial LCIG study the subject and caregiver, if applicable, were required to have diary training which included training of how to understand PD symptomatology and how to complete the PD Diary.  A refresher training will be provided to the subjects and their caregivers.Site personnel should emphasize the importance of completing the PD Diary at half-hour time points in real time during waking hours to ensure true evaluation of the subject's condition.Section 11.2.2  UPDRSAdd:  new section title and text11.2.2 UPDRSThe United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease.  To be qualified by the Sponsor, all raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater Certificate.  The UPDRS is made up of the following sections:\u25cf Part I \u2013 Mentation, Behavior, and Mood\u25cf Part II \u2013 Activities of Daily Living\u25cf Part III \u2013 Motor Examination\u25cf Part IV \u2013 Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3391\u25cf Part V \u2013 Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging\u25cf Part VI \u2013 Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living ScaleSome sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity.  UPDRS total score ranges from 0 to 176, with 176 representing the worst (total) disability, and 0 no disability.  Additionally, Questions 32, 33, and 34 on UPDRS will be totaled to evaluate dyskinesias.  The complete UPDRS (all sections) should be completed at the times indicated in Table 2.The complete UPDRS will be done within 1 to 4 hours after the first morning dose of trial medication during LCIG treatment.  UPDRS Rater TrainingThe UPDRS assessments will be administered only by individuals qualified by the Sponsor and rater training vendor.  Prior to administration of respective scale(s), designated raters (Investigator or an experienced and medically qualified study site designee (e.g., RN, NP, PA, DO, MD, or PhD) assigned by the Investigator) must be certified in the use of the UPDRS.  The objective of this certification/training is to ensure uniformity across sites in the administration and scoring of these assessments. AbbVie, in conjunction with the rater training vendor, will determine the minimum rater qualifications for the rating scales.  All raters must meet these qualifications prior to participation in the training process.  The qualifications of the raters will be verified through the training vendor.  Qualified raters will be certified or re-certified based on prior LCIG study training.  Individual exceptions to these requirements must be ap proved by the Sponsor via the training vendor.Only those persons who have been trained and certified as raters for this study may rate the subjects.  Raters who become involved in the study after the initial training will not be Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3392permitted to perform study ratings until they have satisfactorily completed an individualized training program designed by the rater training vendor, approved by AbbVie, and supervised by the Investigator or his/her designee.  Raters may be reassessed periodically throughout the study.Section 11.2.3  PDQ-39Add:  new section title and text11.2.3 PDQ-39The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure aspects of health that are relevant to subjects with PD, and which may not be included in general health status questionnaires.  The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire that comprises 39 items addressing the following eight domains of health that subjects consider to be adversely affected by the disease:\u25cf Mobility (e.g., fear of falling when walking)\u25cf Activities of daily living (e.g., difficulty cutting food)\u25cf Emotional well-being (e.g., feelings of isolation)\u25cf Stigma (e.g., social embarrassment)\u25cf Social support\u25cf Cognition\u25cf Communication\u25cf Bodily discomfortThe PDQ-39 summary index ranges from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status.  Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.  In addition to the summary index, the results can be presented as eight discrete domain scores.  The PDQ-39 will be completed at the times indicated in Table 2.Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-3393Section 11.3  Other AssessmentsPreviously read:Informed ConsentVoluntary written informed consent must be obtained from each subject (and if appropriate, their caregiver) prior to performing any study-related procedures (see Section 4.3).Concomitant MedicationConcomitant medication will be recorded at each study visit.

The following summaries of TEAE's will be prepared:\u25cf Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events\u25cf Incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events\u25cf Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in study termination\u25cf Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events of special interestThe following additional analyses of safety will also be prepared:\u25cf Summary of vital sign and weight values and change from Baseline over time\u25cf Incidence of potentially clinically significant vital sign and weight values\u25cf Summary of clinical lab values and change from Baseline to Endpoint\u25cf Summary of special lab values and change from Baseline over time\u25cf Summary of ECG clinical interpretations over time\u25cf Shifts in ECG clinical interpretations from Baseline to Endpoint\u25cf Summary of neurological examination clinical interpretations over timeLevodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-33102\u25cf Shifts in neurological examination clinical interpretations over time\u25cf Summary of MIDI at Baseline and during treatment\u25cf Summary of C-SSRS\u25cf Incidence of device complicationsAdditional AnalysisSubject disposition will be summarized including the primary reason for premature discontinuations and a listing of all subjects not included in the safety population.Descriptive statistics will be provided for demographics and baseline characteristics.Concomitant medication use will be summarized over time.Baseline and EndpointThe baseline value for a variable is defined as the last non-missing value collected in the current study or the previous open-label LCIG study before the first dose of study drug in the current study.The endpoint value for a variable is defined as the last non-missing value assigned to the treatment for the subject.Has been changed to read:Safety AnalysisThe Safety Population will be used for the analysis of the safety and tolerability data.Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any adverse event that begins or worsens in severity on or after the first dose of study drug in the current study and within 30 days of the end of LCIG treatment in the current study.  For subjects transferring to commercial product, the end of treatment in the current study will be the Levodopa-CarbidopaS187.3.005 Protocol Amendment 4EudraCT 2008-001329-33103last dose of study drug.  For subjects who are discontinuing LCIG treatment, the end of treatment in the current study will be the removal of the PEG-J tube.
