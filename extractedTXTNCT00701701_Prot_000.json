The ITIRB will also provide \nrecommendations about the risk/benefit profile of the ITI regimens.  Should any safety concern arise, the \nfinal decision regarding the continuation of any or all patients in the study will be made by the Genzyme \nGlobal Patient Safety and Risk Management (GPS-RM) Safety Officer, or designee, and the ITIRB.  If \nthere are no major safety concerns, patients will continue to receive treatment in the study. \nAn independent Allergic Reaction Review Board (ARRB) will be consulted on an ad hoc basis, as \noutlined in the ARRB Charter (which is also maintained separately from the protocol).  Should any \nmajor safety issues arise, the final decisions regarding the study will be made by the Genzyme GPS-RM \nSafety Officer, or designee, and the ARRB. \nFor consistency, a central cardiologist will review all electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiograms \n(ECHOs). \nFollowing study completion, patients may receive commercial Myozyme treatment as prescribed by \ntheir treating physicians.  To facilitate long-term data collection, patients will be encouraged to enroll in \nthe Pompe Disease Registry after study completion. \nNUMBER OF SUBJECTS:  It is planned that a total of 9 patients will initially be enrolled in the study.  \nPatients will be assigned to either Regimen A or Regimen B based on their qualifications for a given \nregimen.  Regimens will enroll as patients present until a total of 9 patients are treated.  An attempt will \nbe made to enroll a similar number of CRIM-positive and CRIM-negative patients on Regimen A, \nprovided that sufficient number of qualified CRIM-negative patients can be identified within a \nreasonable study recruitment period.  Enrollment will proceed in a sequential manner within each \ntreatment regimen such that ITIRB review of data from the first patient within a regimen (for the first \nmonth of treatment) is completed prior to enrollment of any further patients on that regimen.  If the \nregimen appears to have an acceptable risk/benefit profile after the first 3 patients in a given regimen \nhave completed 1 month of treatment, additional patients may be enrolled as they present, or as \nnecessary, to further evaluate the ITI regimen. \nDIAGNOSIS/INCLUSION CRITERIA: \nInclusion Criteria: \n1. The patient (and/or the patient\u2019s legal guardian(s) if the patient is <18 years of age) must \nprovide written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures being performed; \n2. The patient must have a clinical diagnosis of Pompe disease as defined by documented acid \n\u03b1-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency (deficient endogenous GAA activity) in skin fibroblasts, \nmuscle, or blood, or presence of 2 GAA mutations.  Consent will also be sought from the \nbiological parent(s) for parental GAA mutational analysis, but is not a requirement for study \neligibility; \n3. The patient (and/or the patient\u2019s legal guardian(s) if the patient is <18 years of age) must have \nthe ability to comply with the clinical protocol. \n4. If the patient is CRIM-positive, he/she must have received Myozyme therapy (20 mg/kg qow) \nfor at least 6 consecutive months immediately prior to enrollment in the study.  \n5.

Additional immunology measurements will include anti-rhGAA immunoglobulin E \n(IgE), serum tryptase, complement activation, and skin testing, when clinically indicated following \nmoderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent mild (Grade 1) infusion-\nassociated reactions (IARs) to Myozyme that are suggestive of hypersensitivity; and circulating immune \ncomplex detection when clinically indicated by symptoms suggestive of immune complex disease.   \nResearch immunophenotyping and functional T cell assays will also be performed as exploratory \nmeasures.   \nSTATISTICAL METHODS: \nStatistical analyses of all safety and efficacy measurements will be conducted on all patients who receive \nMyozyme under this protocol.  All data will be presented in by patient listings.  Graphical displays will \nbe presented as appropriate.  Summary statistics will be produced as appropriate and meaningful.  \nContinuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, median, \nstandard deviation, minimum, and maximum).  Categorical variables will be summarized using \nfrequencies and percentages.  No statistical testing will be conducted.  Missing data will not be imputed \nusing statistical methods. \nGENZYME CORPORATION \nFINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009 \nPROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL \nPage 7\n \n",

Patients were randomized equally to receive either 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg Myozyme qow, with length of treatment ranging from 52 to 106 weeks.  The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and free of invasive ventilation at 18 months of age (time to event) with an untreated historical cohort derived from a retrospective natural history study (n=62) serving as a comparator group.  At the 18-month milestone age, 15 (83%) of the 18 patients were alive and free of invasive ventilation (3 patients were alive but invasively ventilated).  In contrast, only 2% of cases in the untreated historical cohort survived by age 18 months.  At the end of Study AGLU01602, 17 of the 18 treated patients were alive; 1 patient required invasive ventilation at 19.4 months and later died from desaturation and bradycardia (unrelated to Myozyme) at 19.8 months of age.  Sixteen of the 17 surviving patients went on to receive Myozyme treatment in an approximately 12-month extension study (AGLU02403).  The remaining patient continued to receive treatment with Myozyme via the international expanded access program at a center near the patient's home and subsequently died of multi-organ failure secondary to septicemia (unrelated to Myozyme).  At the end of Study AGLU02403, 14 (77.8%) of the 18 patients initially treated in AGLU01602 were alive.  The 2 patients who died in AGLU02403 were invasively ventilated at the time of death; cause of death in both patients was cardiorespiratory arrest assessed as unrelated to treatment with Myozyme. ",

In CRIM-negative patients who already present with clinical \ndecline and inhibitory antibodies or high anti-rhGAA titer, a more aggressive ITI regimen may \nbe warranted to achieve a significant reduction in antibody titer that may lead to clinical \nimprovement.  Due to the increased risk for CRIM-negative patients to develop inhibitory \nantibodies or high anti-rhGAA titer, Genzyme is conducting a separate study (AGLU03807) to \nexplore the effects of ITI in Myozyme-na\u00efve CRIM-negative patients. \nThere are few systematically collected data assessing ITI strategies for patients with LSDs in \ngeneral, and in Pompe disease in particular.  Nevertheless, the potential serious consequence of \nantibody interference with the efficacy of Myozyme in patients with Pompe disease warrants \nconsideration of therapeutic intervention with highly experimental ITI regimens.  It is \nhypothesized that prevention or significant reduction of antibody formation may minimize the \nclinical impact of antibodies on treatment outcomes while allowing continued treatment with \nMyozyme.   \nThe development of an ITI protocol for this Pompe patient population is challenging.  Relevant \nclinical precedent was primarily established in diseases such as hemophilia, which is not directly \ncomparable to Pompe disease.  For example, hemophiliac patients are deficient in a secreted \nplasma protein while Pompe patients are deficient in an intracellular catabolic enzyme, which is \nmostly secluded in the lysosome.  Also, the presence of cardiac disease and respiratory \ninsufficiency in the Pompe disease population adds a risk of potential cardiopulmonary \ncomplications due to immunotherapy that is usually not a concern for patients with hemophilia. \nExperience with the use of ITI regimens in other LSDs has shown that a total dose increase and \nchange from biweekly to weekly infusions of ERT was successful for 2 patients with Gaucher \ndisease who exhibited limited clinical benefit and inhibitory antibody development, as reported \nin the literature (Zhao, 2003, Blood Cells Mol Dis; Ponce, 1997, Blood).  A third patient with \ntype 3 Gaucher disease successfully underwent ITI with a combination of increased dose of ERT \nand a 10-day cyclophosphamide regimen, including plasmapheresis on days 1, 3 and 5, and \nadministration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on days 5 to 10, as well as low-dose, oral \ncyclophosphamide for up to 30 days (Brady, 1997, Pediatrics).   \nThere also has been limited experience with the use of ITI regimens in Pompe disease.  Two \nCRIM-negative infants who received an earlier form of rhGAA (Synpac rhGAA under \nInvestigational New Drug [IND] application 8324; different from Myozyme) developed high, \nsustained anti-rhGAA IgG titers and underwent unsuccessful experimental ITI on an ITI regimen \nsimilar to that described by Brady et al (Brady, 1997, Pediatrics).  In addition, 1 of these patients \nalso received a total of 6 doses of Rituxan\u00ae (rituximab) in a subsequent, also unsuccessful, ITI \nregimen attempt (Genzyme Study GAA-CL-002).  In both patients, the ITI regimens proved \nGENZYME CORPORATION \nFINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009 \nPROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL \nPage 18\n \nMyozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) \n19 \nClinical Protocol Number AGLU03707, Amendment 3 \n \n \n \nineffective, as any reduction in anti-rhGAA antibody levels was transient.  Both patients \nexperienced bacterial and viral infections during the ITI regimen; these infections were \nconsidered by the treating physicians to be possibly due to a weakened immune system.  One \npatient developed nephrotic syndrome secondary to immune complex formation while receiving \nhigh-dose Synpac rhGAA administered 5 times weekly; the onset of nephrotic syndrome \noccurred after the patient had discontinued the ITI regimen (Hunley, 2004, Pediatrics).   \nThrough a series of preclinical studies in GAA knockout mice, which exhibit an rhGAA-specific \nantibody response following treatment with rhGAA, a potential regimen for a short course of \nimmunotherapy to induce long-term immune tolerance to Myozyme has been developed \n(Genzyme Study ITR-333-1106).  The regimen in GAA knockout mice involved prophylactic \nadministration of three 3-day courses of intraperitoneal methotrexate, given around the first 3 or \n8 weekly infusions of Myozyme, and was based on previous experiments performed at Genzyme \nin a GAA knockout mouse model, in which the murine a-glucosidase gene has been disrupted \nthrough insertion of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene in exon 6 (6neo/6neo), as reported by \nRaben et al (Raben, 1998, J Biol Chem).  This regimen, when administered at doses of 0.5 mg/kg \nand 5.0 mg/kg, was found to consistently reduce the antibody levels in GAA knockout mice over \nat least 8 months, although variability was higher at the lower dose.  Notably, a number of \nunsuccessful therapeutic options were also tested in the GAA knockout mouse model, which \nincluded mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A plus azathioprine, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte \nantigen 4-Ig fusion protein, and anti-thymocyte globulin.   \nThis exploratory clinical study (AGLU03707) will employ 2 clinical ITI regimens to determine \nwhether this regimen can reduce the immunogenicity of Myozyme in patients with Pompe \ndisease.  The first regimen (Regimen A) will involve administration of monthly \nIV cyclophosphamide for 6 months.  The second regimen (Regimen B) is similar to that used to \ninduce immune tolerance in GAA knockout mice, and will consist of administration of biweekly \nsubcutaneous (SC) methotrexate for 6 months, with the addition of a 4-week cycle of weekly IV \nrituximab to aid in decreasing long-term antibody production against Myozyme.  These \nimmunosuppressant agents (cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and methotrexate) were considered \nbecause reports exist for use in children (and cyclophosphamide and methotrexate are both \napproved for specific indications in children), and these agents have been used successfully to \ntreat diseases with an important immunologic component such as systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), including cases where other therapies have failed, \nalthough the specific mechanism of action of these agents in the treatment of pediatric SLE and \nJRA are not known.  Cyclophosphamide is proposed for patients already demonstrating high \nantibody titers and/or in vitro inhibitory antibodies along with evidence of clinical decline, and \nwas chosen primarily because of its rapid onset of action and potency based on limited \nGENZYME CORPORATION \nFINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009 \nPROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL \nPage 19\n \nMyozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) 20 Clinical Protocol Number AGLU03707, Amendment 3    information in children with immune diseases (primarily SLE and JRA, as described above).  In CRIM-negative patients who do not yet demonstrate high antibody titers, inhibitory antibodies, or evidence of clinical decline, a regimen consisting of weekly rituximab and biweekly methotrexate is proposed because there may be less acute toxicity with this regimen, and it may therefore be more appropriate for a population where there is no immediate need to reduce antibody titer.  It is recommended that the Investigator monitor a patient\u2019s immunoglobulin levels and consider IVIG administration, regardless of age, if indicated per the individual Investigator\u2019s clinical discretion. The development of antibody titers in patients treated with Myozyme points towards a role of the B cell compartment component in immunological response; however, the role of the T cell compartment in patients with Pompe disease has not been previously evaluated.  Therefore, in conjunction with administration of an ITI regimen in this study, laboratory assessments will be performed to study the contribution of the T cell compartment to the immune response against Myozyme.  Genzyme will also investigate the correlation among genotype, the level of \u03b1-glucosidase protein, and the presence of binding, anti-rhGAA IgG, and inhibitory antibodies over time, using validated assays.

A patient who completes the initial cycle of rituximab treatment may be considered for an optional, additional 4-week cycle of rituximab (up to 4 additional doses) within the first 6 months of the study, as described in Section 8.1.  The total number of weekly 375 mg/m2 IV infusions of rituximab will not exceed 8 doses. Rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody designed to target the CD20 antigen, which is a transmembrane protein expressed on >90% of all B cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas.  CD20 expression is restricted to B cell precursors and mature B cells, and is not found in plasma cells (or other normal tissues).  Rituximab is approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis.  Rituximab is a liquid concentrate intended for IV administration via a dedicated line.   In 14 patients given rituximab 375 mg/m2 as an IV infusion for 4 weekly doses, the mean serum half-life was 76.3 hours (range 31.5 to 152.6 hours) after the first infusion and 205.8 hours (range 83.9 to 407.0 hours) after the fourth infusion.

Methotrexate is approved for the treatment of cancer of the breast, head and neck, lung, stomach, and esophagus, as well as gestational trophoblastic cancer, sarcomas, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn\u2019s disease.  To date, the safety and effectiveness of methotrexate for a pediatric population has been established for its use as therapy for cancer and polyarticular-course JRA.  Methotrexate will be administered SC in this study, as experience in the treatment of polyarticular-course JRA suggests that children receiving 20 to 30 mg/m2/week may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or SC.  Folinic acid may be given at the discretion of the Investigator beginning 24 hours after the dose of methotrexate. Further details on the potential risks of methotrexate are provided in Section 4.4.2.3.  A full description of methotrexate is available in the local prescribing information.  The US prescribing information is provided as an appendix to this protocol (Appendix 14.3); additional countries should refer to their local authorities\u2019 approved prescribing information.  Investigators should familiarize themselves with any relevant premedication requirements, contraindications, warnings, precautions for use, and the AE profile provided therein. ",

                                "Content": " ITI requires the use of agents that may cause additional complications (such as recurrent infections) that could be fatal for critically ill patients with Pompe disease.  For these reasons, Genzyme recommends that careful consideration of the risks and benefits for the individual patient be given and that investigators overseeing this protocol and administering the agents in this regimen should be familiar with the medications administered, and preferably be an infectious disease expert and/or other specialist (such as an oncologist, immunologist, rheumatologist, or transplant specialist).   As discussed in detail in Section 4.4.2.1, Section 4.4.2.2 and Section 4.4.2.3, respectively, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and methotrexate can have direct toxicities.  As there are no controlled studies using these agents in patients with Pompe disease or other patients <2 years of age who have diseases other than Pompe, the toxicities are unknown.  Furthermore, the proposed treatment combinations of Myozyme with cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and/or methotrexate have not been used, and the combination of agents could have broader side effects than those observed with the individual agents.  During this study, patients should be closely monitored for any signs of toxicity, including monitoring for any changes in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), platelets, white cell count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin, the presence of red cells in the urine, as well as any clinical symptoms of renal, hepatic, bone marrow, or pulmonary toxicity.  Potentially confounding factors include the frequent elevation of ALT, AST, creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) (secondary to muscle cell damage) and respiratory complications in patients with Pompe disease. Immunosuppression can also result in opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia as well as other common and opportunistic bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.  Patients with Pompe disease may be at increased risk of such infections due to the progressive effects of the disease on the respiratory muscles.  In the AGLU03707 study, precautions must be taken to prevent the transmission of infection, and GENZYME CORPORATION FINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009 PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL Page 25 Myozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) 26 Clinical Protocol Number AGLU03707, Amendment 3    infection prophylaxis for P. jiroveci is recommended.  Patients should be monitored closely for any sign of infection during the study, with consequent aggressive treatment and management if this should occur.  In selecting an antibiotic to treat the infection, attention should be given to potential drug interactions among the investigative agents and certain antibiotics.  It is also recommended that an infectious disease specialist be consulted whenever any antimicrobial agent is to be administered for the treatment of active infection in patients receiving the ITI regimen.  Further detail on supportive measures for prophylaxis, monitoring, and treatment of infections are provided in Section 8.3, and in the Study Operations Manual (SOM). Vaccination with live virus is not recommended in immunosuppressed children.  Therefore, in the AGLU03707 study, vaccination with live virus will be prohibited within 1 month prior to enrollment in this study and until a patient\u2019s B cell count returns to normal or at least 3 months following completion of the ITI regimen, whichever is longer.  The effectiveness of inactive virus given concomitantly with the immunosuppressant agents in this study is questionable.  However, patients undergoing ITI regimens may benefit from specific immunizations directed at preventing infections by organisms to which they are particularly susceptible, e.g., pneumococcal, influenza, and/or meningococcal vaccines.  Further detail is provided in Section 8.3, and in the SOM. Adjustment to a patient\u2019s ITI regimen may be made in consultation with Genzyme (and the Immune Tolerance Induction Review Board [ITIRB], as appropriate) if medically indicated, in an effort to allow the patient to safely continue in the study while maintaining the potential clinical benefit of the regimen.  If severe toxicity or infection should occur (see Section 7.3.2), the patient will be temporarily withdrawn from the ITI regimen until further evaluation, and the regimen may be permanently discontinued pending the outcome of that evaluation.  The Investigator may also withdraw the patient from the regimen at any time, if he/she considers this to be in the best interest of the patient.   ",

Amenorrhea associated with decreased \nestrogen and increased gonadotropin secretion develops in a significant proportion of women \ntreated with cyclophosphamide; affected patients generally resume regular menses within a few \nmonths after cessation of therapy.  Men treated with cyclophosphamide may develop \noligospermia or azoospermia associated with increased gonadotropin but normal testosterone \nsecretion; azoospermia is reversible in some patients, though the reversibility may not occur for \nseveral years after cessation of therapy.  \nCyclophosphamide can also cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, with \nreported fetal abnormalities including ectrodactylia.  Women of childbearing potential should be \nadvised to avoid becoming pregnant.  If a patient should become pregnant while taking \ncyclophosphamide, that patient should be appraised of the potential hazard to the fetus.   \nHemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide; in rare instances \nthis can be severe and even fatal.  Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may \ndevelop with or without accompanying cystitis.  Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may \nappear in the urine.  These adverse effects appear to depend upon the dose of cyclophosphamide \nand the duration of therapy.  Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide \nmetabolites excreted in the urine.  Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample output of urine, \nnecessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder.  Hematuria \nusually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it may persist.  \nMedical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of \nsevere hemorrhagic cystitis.  It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in \ninstances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis.  In the current study, patients should be well hydrated \nprior to cyclophosphamide infusion (taking into account the proper hydration given the patient\u2019s \ncardiac status) and monitored regularly for the presence of red cells in the urine, which may \nprecede hemorrhagic cystitis. \nAlthough a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of \nrecommended doses of cyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established.

Deaths have been reported within 24 hours of infusion with rituximab.  These fatal infusion reactions followed an infusion reaction complex, which included hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock.  Approximately 80% of fatal infusion reactions occurred with the first infusion.  Therefore, in the current study, all rituximab infusions will be administered in a hospital setting with appropriate emergency care facilities.  Severe mucocutaneous reactions, some fatal, have been reported with rituximab.  These include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.  The onset of the reaction in the reported cases has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following rituximab exposure.  Patients experiencing a severe mucocutaneous reaction should not receive any further infusions and should receive prompt medical evaluation. Rituximab is contraindicated for patients with known anaphylaxis or IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to murine proteins or to any component of the product. Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions have had recurrences of these events during rituximab therapy.  To manage these risks in the current study, continuous telemetry will be performed during all rituximab infusions, and infusions will be discontinued in the event of serious or life threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and may be adjusted or discontinued in response to any other clinically significant findings, at the discretion of the Investigator.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation along with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies.  The rituximab prescribing information recommends that persons at high risk of HBV infection be screened before initiation of treatment, and that carriers of Hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection and for signs of hepatitis during and for up to several months following rituximab therapy.  Due to the combined risk of HBV reactivation with rituximab and methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity, patients who are at risk of HBV reactivation or who are known carriers of Hepatitis B (i.e., Hepatitis B surface antigen is positive) will be excluded from the current study.   The following additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated or exacerbated, have been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports with rituximab, the majority of these in patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant: JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus, Parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and Hepatitis C.  JC virus (PML) is a very rare complication of rituximab and usually occurs only in conjunction with the use of other immunosuppressants over an extended period of time; the disease usually leads to life-threatening disability and death over weeks to months.  In some cases, viral infections occurred up to 1 year following discontinuation of rituximab and resulted in death. ",

Investigators should familiarize themselves with any relevant premedication requirements, contraindications, warnings, precautions for use, and the AE profile provided therein.  A summary of boxed warnings and contraindications relevant to this patient population is provided directly below. Methotrexate should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced with antimetabolite treatments. Deaths have been reported with the use of methotrexate in the treatment of malignancy, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.  Patients should be closely monitored for bone marrow, liver, lung, and kidney toxicities. Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the major factors for methotrexate toxicity.  Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural GENZYME CORPORATION FINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009 PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 Myozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) \n30 \nClinical Protocol Number AGLU03707, Amendment 3 \n \n \n \neffusions.  Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose \nreduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration. \nUnexpectedly severe, and sometimes fatal, bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia, and GI \ntoxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high \ndosage) along with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  With lower doses, \nNSAIDs and salicylates have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an \nanimal model and may enhance its toxicity.  Therefore, concomitant administration of NSAIDs \nis strongly discouraged for patients receiving Regimen B in the current study. \nMethotrexate should be used with extreme caution in the presence of active infection.  Oral \nantibiotics, such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and non-absorbable broad spectrum antibiotics \nmay decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with enterohepatic circulation by \ninhibiting bowel flora and suppressing metabolism of the drug by bacteria.  Penicillins may \nreduce the renal clearance of methotrexate; increased serum concentrations of methotrexate with \nconcomitant hematologic and GI toxicity have been observed with high- and low-dose \nmethotrexate; use of methotrexate with penicillins should be carefully monitored.  Sulfonamides \nalso may decrease renal clearance of methotrexate and increase the risk of hematologic toxicity.  \nTherefore, penicillins and sulfonamides should be used with extreme caution for patients \nreceiving Regimen B in the current study. \nMethotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged \nuse.  Acute liver enzyme elevations are common; these are usually transient and asymptomatic, \nand do not appear predictive of later hepatic disease.  Liver biopsy after sustained use often \nshows histologic changes, and fibrosis and cirrhosis have been reported.  In rheumatoid arthritis \npatients persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede the appearance of fibrosis or \ncirrhosis, but in psoriasis patients these lesions are not necessarily preceded by symptoms or \nabnormal liver function tests.  Methotrexate will be administered for a short duration in the \ncurrent study; however, the possibility of liver lesions cannot be ruled out, and it is unknown \nwhether such lesions, if they were to occur, would be preceded by clinical symptoms or \nabnormal liver function tests in Pompe patients. \nMethotrexate-induced lung disease, including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis, is a \npotentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has been \nreported at low doses.  It is not always fully reversible and fatalities have been reported.  The \nprescribing information for methotrexate recommends interruption of treatment and careful \ninvestigation in the event of pulmonary symptoms, especially nonproductive dry cough.  In \npatients with Pompe disease, monitoring for pulmonary toxicity may be complicated by pre-\nexisting respiratory ailments due to disease progression.  Therefore, it is suggested that patients \nGENZYME CORPORATION \nFINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009 \nPROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL \nPage 30\n \nMyozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) 31 Clinical Protocol Number AGLU03707, Amendment 3    have a chest X-ray obtained prior to beginning their methotrexate dosing so that it may be used at a later time for comparison should respiratory complications arise during the study.  In such patients, careful attention should be given to any worsening of symptoms and these should be thoroughly investigated prior to resuming the ITI regimen.  Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of treatment; otherwise, intestinal perforation may lead to hemorrhagic enteritis and death. Malignant lymphoma may occur with low-dose treatment and may regress when treatment is discontinued. Severe, occasionally fatal skin reactions may occur within days after single or multiple doses.  Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy. Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially P. jiroveci pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy. Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital anomalies.  Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to outweigh the considered risks.  Women of childbearing potential should not be started on methotrexate until pregnancy is excluded and should be fully counseled on the serious risk to the fetus should they become pregnant while undergoing treatment.  Pregnancy should be avoided if either partner is receiving methotrexate: during and for a minimum of 3 months after therapy for male patients, and during and for at least 1 ovulatory cycle after therapy for female patients.  Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from methotrexate in breast-fed infants, it is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Limited experience in the treatment of polyarticular-course JRA shows a significant increase in the incidence and severity of serious toxic reactions, especially bone marrow suppression, at doses >20 mg/m2/week in adults.  Although there is experience with doses up to 30 mg/m2/week in children, there are too few published data to assess how doses over 20 mg/m2/week might affect the risk of serious toxicity in children.  Experience does suggest, however, that children receiving 20 to 30 mg/m2/week may have better absorption and fewer GI side effects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or SC. ",

The patient (and/or the patient\u2019s legal guardian(s) if the patient is <18 years of age) is free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time, and without prejudice to further treatment. Any female patient who becomes pregnant will be discontinued from the study. A patient\u2019s participation in the study may also be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator.  The following may be justifiable reasons for the Investigator to remove a patient from the study: \u2022 Parents/guardians are non-compliant and will not adhere to study responsibilities, including failure to appear at study visits; \u2022 The patient was erroneously included in the study; \u2022 The patient develops an exclusion criterion or concurrent disease; \u2022 The patient suffers an intolerable AE; \u2022 The patient receives other investigational products, interventions, or procedures during the study; \u2022 The patient suffers severe toxicity or infection and supportive treatment and/or regimen adjustment are deemed to be inadequate to resolve the toxicity or infection, or are inconsistent with the patient\u2019s ability to safely complete the protocol (see Section 7.3.2 for guidelines); \u2022 The study is terminated by the Sponsor. For patients who discontinue early from the study, or if the study is prematurely terminated by the Sponsor, the Investigator or designee will contact the patient and/or the patient\u2019s legal guardian(s) within 4 to 7 days after withdrawal or termination to obtain information about the reason(s) for discontinuation and to assess for any AEs.  The Investigator should collect information pertaining to new AEs and follow-up ongoing AEs.  In addition, the Investigator should immediately contact Genzyme to discuss the reasons for the patient\u2019s discontinuation.

All AEs ongoing at the time of withdrawal or study termination require a 30-day follow up.  The Investigator will provide a written report on the Completion/Discontinuation section of the electronic case report form (eCRF), describing the reason for discontinuation.  The Investigator will attempt to collect all withdrawal assessments if a patient discontinues from the study.  The Investigator will be asked to follow all SAEs that were ongoing at the time of withdrawal or termination until resolution (and information reported to Genzyme Global Patient Safety and Risk Management [GPS-RM]), until the Investigator deems follow-up is no longer medically necessary, or until the patient is lost to follow-up.   In addition, if a patient in Regimen B discontinues the study for any reason during the ITI treatment module, the Investigator will continue to follow-up with the patient for a period of at least 45 days after the last dose of rituximab is administered (at a medically appropriate frequency to be determined by the Investigator) to monitor for any new AEs that may be suggestive of immunosuppressant-induced toxicity and/or are secondary to immunosuppression. Because there have been documented incidents of delayed onset of AEs related to rituximab administration (Ram, 2009, Leukemia Lymphoma), it is recommended that physicians report any AEs suggestive of immunosuppressant-induced toxicity to the product manufacturer in addition to Genzyme as a spontaneous report.  For patients who have withdrawn consent or who have otherwise completed the clinical study, these data will not be included in the clinical study database, but will be maintained in the GPS-RM surveillance database. In the event that a patient dies, permission will be sought (through a separate informed consent form) from the next of kin or the patient\u2019s legal guardian(s) for a research autopsy or post-mortem research biopsy.

Prophylaxis for other opportunistic bacterial, fungal, and/or viral infections may also be considered at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with current pediatric antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines (Red Book: Antimicrobial Prophylaxis, 2003). Patients should be monitored closely for any sign of infection, with consequent aggressive treatment and management, should this occur.  In selecting an antibiotic to treat the infection, attention should be given to potential drug interactions among the investigative agents and certain antibiotics.  For patients on Regimen B, sulfonamides and penicillins should be used with extreme caution due to the potential for these agents to reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate with a resultant increased risk of hematologic and/or GI toxicity.  It is recommended that an infectious disease specialist be consulted whenever any antimicrobial agent is to be administered for the treatment of active infection in patients receiving Regimen B. Vaccination with live virus is prohibited within 1 month prior to enrollment in this study and until a patient\u2019s B cell count returns to normal, or at least 3 months following completion of the ITI regimen, whichever is longer.  While inactivated vaccines are permitted, the effectiveness of inactive virus given concomitantly with cyclophosphamide, rituximab, or methotrexate is questionable.  However, patients undergoing ITI regimens may benefit from specific immunizations directed at preventing infections by organisms to which they are particularly susceptible; special consideration should be given to the administration of pneumococcal, influenza, and/or meningococcal vaccines, and any other recommendations for immunosuppressed patients, as outlined in the Red Book (Red Book: Immunizations in Special Clinical Circumstances, 2003).   Further information regarding infection prophylaxis and the treatment of active infection is provided in the SOM. See also Section 7.3.2, Patient Withdrawal from the ITI Regimen. ",

Testing performed prior to informed consent is allowed, provided that written results are provided to the site.  If consent is \nprovided, samples also will be obtained from the biological parent(s) at baseline. \n4 Pregnancy testing for female patients of childbearing potential will be repeated on Day 0 if this occurs >14 days after the baseline test.  Pregnancy test results must be obtained prior to starting the ITI \nregimen, and patients with positive test results will be excluded (or withdrawn) from the study. \n5 In addition to the scheduled physical examinations, brief, physical assessments should also be performed prior to the administration of any study medications (Myozyme and cyclophosphamide) to \nspecifically ensure that the patient is clinically stable and can tolerate administration of these agents. \n6 Results of the most recent laboratory tests (obtained on the day of the infusion) should be reviewed by Investigators prior to dosing with cyclophosphamide.  Results of the most recent immunoglobulin \npanel should also be reviewed prior to dosing. \n7 If a patient becomes anti-rhGAA (IgG) positive during the course of the study, he/she will also be tested every 2 months for the presence of inhibitory antibodies to Myozyme. \n8 Patients with cardiomegaly or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be admitted to the hospital for all cyclophosphamide infusions and will remain in the hospital for a minimum of 24 hours post-infusion. \n9 Patients should be well-hydrated prior to cyclophosphamide administration, but the patients\u2019 cardiac status should be taken into account when determining appropriate amount of hydration. \n10 A visit window of \u00b17 days will be permitted for the Pompe PEDI, GMFM-66, and AIMS.  All remaining study assessments should be conducted at the indicated study visit during the ITI treatment \nmodule.  Eligible CRIM-negative patients will be followed for a minimum of 18 months on treatment or, if a patient is <6 months of age at the time of enrollment, until the patient is 2 years of age. \n11 All concomitant medications and therapies, including those given as prophylaxis or prior to an infusion, will be recorded in the eCRF. \nNote:  It is recommended that the Investigator monitor a patient\u2019s immunoglobulin levels and consider IVIG administration at a dose of 400 mg/kg, regardless of age, if indicated per the individual \nInvestigator\u2019s clinical discretion. \nKey:  AIMS=Alberta Infantile Motor Scale; BL=baseline/screening; CBC=complete blood count; CK=creatine kinase; CK-MB=creatine kinase \u2013 myocardial band; CRIM=cross-reacting immunologic \nmaterial; D=day; ECG= electrocardiogram; ECHO; echocardiogram; ELISPOT=enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot [assay]; GAA=acid\uf020 \u03b1-glucosidase; GMFM-66=Gross Motor Function Measure-66; \nIgG=immunoglobulin G; IVIG=intravenous immunoglobulin; PEDI=Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory; rhGAA=Recombinant human acid \u03b1-glucosidase; W=week \n \n \nGENZYME CORPORATION \nFINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009 \nPROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL \nPage 58\nMyozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) 59Clinical Protocol Number AGLU03707, Amendment 3   ",

Testing performed prior to informed consent is allowed, provided that written results are provided to the site.  If consent is \nprovided, samples also will be obtained from the biological parent(s) at baseline. \n4 Pregnancy testing for female patients of childbearing potential will be repeated on Day 0 if this occurs >14 days after the baseline test.  Pregnancy test results must be obtained prior to starting the ITI \nregimen, and patients with positive test results will be excluded (or withdrawn) from the study. \n5 In addition to the scheduled physical examinations, brief, physical assessments should also be performed prior to the administration of any study medications (Myozyme, methotrexate, or rituximab) to \nensure that the patient is clinically stable and can tolerate administration of these agents. \n6 Results for the most recent laboratory tests (obtained the preceding day prior to initiating the Myozyme infusion) should be reviewed by Investigators prior to dosing with rituximab and methotrexate.  \nResults of the most recent immunoglobulin panel should also be reviewed prior to dosing. \n7 If a patient becomes anti-rhGAA (IgG) positive during the course of the study, he/she will also be tested every 2 months for the presence of inhibitory antibodies to Myozyme. \n8 Patients with cardiomegaly or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be admitted to the hospital for all cyclophosphamide infusions and will remain in the hospital for a minimum of 24 hours post-infusion. \n9 Patients will be admitted to the hospital for all rituximab infusions and will remain in the hospital for a minimum of 24 hours post-infusion.  Telemetry will be performed during all rituximab infusions \nfrom at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the infusion until at least 2 hours post-infusion. \n10 An optional, additional 4-week cycle of rituximab (up to 4 additional doses) may be administered as described in Section 8.1.  This additional cycle must be completed within the first 6 months of the \nstudy. \n11 Pre-infusion medication may be given as per rituximab treatment guidelines. \n12 Patients should be well-hydrated prior to methotrexate administration, but the patients\u2019 cardiac status should be taken into account when determining appropriate amount of hydration. \n13 Folinic acid supplementation may be given at the discretion of the Investigator beginning 24 hours after the dose of methotrexate. \n14 A visit window of \u00b17 days will be permitted for the Pompe PEDI, GMFM-66, and AIMS.  All remaining study assessments should be conducted at the indicated study visit during the ITI treatment \nmodule.  Eligible CRIM-negative patients will be followed for a minimum of 18 months on treatment or, if a patient is <6 months of age at the time of enrollment, until the patient is 2 years of age. \n15 All concomitant medications and therapies, including those given as prophylaxis or prior to an infusion, will be recorded in the eCRF. \nNote:  It is recommended that the Investigator monitor a patient\u2019s immunoglobulin levels and consider IVIG administration at a dose of 400 mg/kg, regardless of age, if indicated per the individual \nInvestigator\u2019s clinical discretion. \nKey:  AIMS=Alberta Infantile Motor Scale; BL=baseline/screening; CBC=complete blood count; CK=creatine kinase; CK-MB=creatine kinase \u2013 myocardial band; CRIM=cross-reacting immunologic \nmaterial; D=day; ECG= electrocardiogram; ECHO; echocardiogram; ELISPOT=enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot [assay]; GAA=acid \uf020\u03b1-glucosidase; GMFM-66=Gross Motor Function Measure-66; \nIgG=immunoglobulin G; IVIG=intravenous immunoglobulin; PEDI=Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory; rhGAA=Recombinant human acid \u03b1-glucosidase; W=week \n \nGENZYME CORPORATION \nFINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009  \nPROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL \nPage 61\nMyozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) 62Clinical Protocol Number AGLU03707, Amendment 3   ",

The GMFM-66 is a standardized observational instrument that has been designed and validated to measure change over time in the gross motor abilities of children with cerebral palsy.  The GMFM-66 is widely used internationally and is recognized as the gold standard for outcomes assessment in clinical interventions for individuals with cerebral palsy.  As the instrument is designed to evaluate change over time in individual patients, there is no age cutoff for administration of the GMFM-66. The GMFM consists of 66 items organized into 5 categories: \u2022 Lying and Rolling; \u2022 Sitting; \u2022 Crawling and Kneeling; \u2022 Standing; \u2022 Walking, Running, and Jumping. Items were selected to represent motor functions typically performed by children without motor impairments by 5 years of age.  Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (i.e., 0 = cannot do; 1 = initiates [<10% of the task]; 2 = partially completes [10 to <100 % of the task]; 3 = task completion; NT = not tested).  The score for each dimension is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension.  The total score is obtained by adding the percentage scores GENZYME CORPORATION FINAL: 01 OCTOBER 2009 PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL Page 67 Myozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) 68 Clinical Protocol Number AGLU03707, Amendment 3    for each dimension and dividing the sum by the total number of dimensions.  Therefore, each dimension contributes equally to the total score.  The validity and reliability of the GMFM-66 were established in patients with cerebral palsy using the GMFM-88, the original 88-item version of the test.  The GMFM-66 is comprised of 66 of the original 88 items.  The GMFM-88 was validated on 136 children with cerebral palsy, 25 children with acute head injuries, and 34 children without motor delays who ranged in age from 1 month to 4.3 years.  The GMFM-66 utilizes a software scoring program called the Gross Motor Ability Estimator (GMAE) that converts the instrument from an ordinal scale to an interval scale based on an individual\u2019s responses for the 66 items of the test.  This conversion system allows for a more precise estimation of the gross motor abilities of the tested individual.  The GMAE scoring system was developed using the results of a Rasch analysis performed on a sample of 537 children with cerebral palsy in Ontario, Canada.   ",

The AIMS assesses the sequential development of motor milestones in terms of progressive development and integration of antigravity muscle control.  An infant is encouraged to demonstrate skills he or she can accomplish spontaneously without the assistance of the examiner.  The role of the assessor is to observe and analyze the infant\u2019s movements.  The AIMS is a norm-referenced test based on age- and sex-stratified normative data.  Scores will be adjusted to account for gestational age only for patients whose gestational age is <37 weeks. The AIMS was normalized using representative samples from the general population.  As such, this instrument allows for the comparison of tested children to healthy, same-age peers.  The AIMS covers normal motor development in infants from birth to 18 months of age.  The test can be used to monitor the progress of a child until he/she successfully achieves the highest level of age-equivalence on the test (18 months of age). In this study, the AIMS will be administered to all patients at study entry, provided they are at or below the highest level of age-equivalent performance for the test (i.e., independent walking), and the AIMS will continue to be administered to these patients until completion of the study to ascertain whether patients maintain any developmental gains achieved while on Myozyme therapy.

                        "Content": "CYTOXAN\u00ae\n(cyclophosphamide for injection, USP)\nCYTOXAN\u00ae Tablets\n(cyclophosphamide tablets, USP)\nDESCRIPTION\nCYTOXAN\u00ae (cyclophosphamide for injection, USP) is a sterile white powder containing cyclophosphamide mono-\nhydrate. CYTOXAN Tablets (cyclophosphamide tablets, USP) are for oral use and contain 25 mg or 50 mg cyclophosphamide\n(anhydrous). Inactive ingredients in CYTOXAN Tablets are: acacia, FD&C Blue No. 1, D&C Yellow No. 10 Aluminum\nLake, lactose, magnesium stearate, starch, stearic acid, and talc. Cyclophosphamide is a synthetic antineo-\nplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. Cyclophosphamide is a white crystalline powder\nwith the molecular formula C7H15Cl2N2O2P\u2022H2O and a molecular weight of 279.1. The chemical name for\ncyclophosphamide is 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohydrate.\nCyclophosphamide is soluble in water, saline, or ethanol and has the following structural formula:\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nCyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed function\nmicrosomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating\nmalignant cells. The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA. \nCyclophosphamide is well absorbed after oral administration with a bioavailability greater than 75%. The\nunchanged drug has an elimination half-life of 3 to 12 hours. It is eliminated primarily in the form of metabolites,\nbut from 5 to 25% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. Several cytotoxic and noncytotoxic\nmetabolites have been identified in urine and in plasma. Concentrations of metabolites reach a maximum in\nplasma 2 to 3 hours after an intravenous dose. Plasma protein binding of unchanged drug is low but some\nmetabolites are bound to an extent greater than 60%. It has not been demonstrated that any single metabolite\nis responsible for either the therapeutic or toxic effects of cyclophosphamide. Although elevated levels of metabo-\nlites of cyclophosphamide have been observed in patients with renal failure, increased clinical toxicity in such\npatients has not been demonstrated.\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE\nMalignant Diseases\nCYTOXAN, although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequen-\ntially with other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to CYTOXAN treatment:\n1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin\u2019s disease, lymphocytic\nlymphoma (nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma.\n2. Multiple myeloma.\n3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute\nblastic crisis), acute myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in\nchildren (CYTOXAN given during remission is effective in prolonging its duration).\n4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease).\n5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). \n6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. \n7. Retinoblastoma.\n8. Carcinoma of the breast.\nNonmalignant Disease\nBiopsy Proven \u201cMinimal Change\u201d Nephrotic Syndrome in Children:\nCYTOXAN is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven \u201cminimal change\u201d nephrotic syndrome in children\nbut should not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate\nadrenocorticosteroid therapy or in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce\nintolerable side effects, CYTOXAN may induce a remission. CYTOXAN is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome\nin adults or for any other renal disease.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nContinued use of cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients with severely depressed bone marrow\nfunction. Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity to\nit. See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.\nWARNINGS\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility\nSecond malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in associ-\nation with other antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myelo-\nproliferative, or lymphoproliferative malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients\ntreated for primary myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune\nprocesses are believed to be involved pathologically.\nIn some cases, the second malignancy developed several years after cyclophosphamide treatment had been\ndiscontinued. In a single breast cancer trial utilizing two to four times the standard dose of cyclophosphamide in\nconjunction with doxorubicin a small number of cases of secondary acute myeloid leukemia occurred within two\nyears of treatment initiation. Urinary bladder malignancies generally have occurred in patients who previously had\nhemorrhagic cystitis. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide-containing regimens for a variety of solid tumors,\nisolated case reports of secondary malignancies have been published. One case of carcinoma of the renal pelvis\nwas reported in a patient receiving long-term cyclophosphamide therapy for cerebral vasculitis. The possibility\nof cyclophosphamide-induced malignancy should be considered in any benefit-to-risk assessment for use of\nthe drug.\nCyclophosphamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and such abnormalities have\nbeen reported following cyclophosphamide therapy in pregnant women. Abnormalities were found in two infants\nand a six-month-old fetus born to women treated with cyclophosphamide. Ectrodactylia was found in two of the\nthree cases. Normal infants have also been born to women treated with cyclophosphamide during pregnancy,\nincluding the first trimester. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking\n(receiving) this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing\npotential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.\nCyclophosphamide interferes with oogenesis and spermatogenesis. It may cause sterility in both sexes. Development\nof sterility appears to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide, duration of therapy, and the state of gonadal\nfunction at the time of treatment. Cyclophosphamide-induced sterility may be irreversible in some patients.\nAmenorrhea associated with decreased estrogen and increased gonadotropin secretion develops in a signif-\nicant proportion of women treated with cyclophosphamide. Affected patients generally resume regular menses\nwithin a few months after cessation of therapy. Girls treated with cyclophosphamide during prepubescence\ngenerally develop secondary sexual characteristics normally and have regular menses. Ovarian fibrosis with\napparently complete loss of germ cells after prolonged cyclophosphamide treatment in late prepubescence has\nbeen reported. Girls treated with cyclophosphamide during prepubescence subsequently have conceived.\nMen treated with cyclophosphamide may develop oligospermia or azoospermia associated with increased\ngonadotropin but normal testosterone secretion. Sexual potency and libido are unimpaired in these patients.\nBoys treated with cyclophosphamide during prepubescence develop secondary sexual characteristics normally,\nbut may have oligospermia or azoospermia and increased gonadotropin secretion. Some degree of testicular\natrophy may occur. Cyclophosphamide-induced azoospermia is reversible in some patients, though the reversi-\nbility may not occur for several years after cessation of therapy. Men temporarily rendered sterile by cyclophos-\nphamide have subsequently fathered normal children.\nUrinary System\nHemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be\nsevere and even fatal. Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without\naccompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects\nappear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and the duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought\nto be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluid intake helps to assure an ample\noutput of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder. This helps\nto prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but\nit may persist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of\nsevere hemorrhagic cystitis. It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of\nsevere hemorrhagic cystitis.\nCardiac Toxicity\nAlthough a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of\ncyclophosphamide, no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with\ndoses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug\nregimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide,\nsevere, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the first cyclophosphamide dose.\nHistopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred\nsecondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of\nany hemopericardium.\nNo residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present\nin patients surviving episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide.\nCyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.\nInfections\nTreatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes\nfatal, infections may develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not\nbe indicated, or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial,\nfungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.  \nOther\nAnaphylactic reactions have been reported; death has also been reported in association with this event. Possible\ncross-sensitivity with other alkylating agents has been reported.\nPRECAUTIONS\nGeneral\nSpecial attention to the possible development of toxicity should be exercised in patients being treated with\ncyclophosphamide if any of the following conditions are present.\n1. Leukopenia\n2. Thrombocytopenia \n3. Tumor cell infiltration of bone marrow\n4. Previous X-ray therapy\n5. Previous therapy with other cytotoxic agents \n6. Impaired hepatic function \n7. Impaired renal function\nLaboratory Tests\nDuring treatment, the patient\u2019s hematologic profile (particularly neutrophils and platelets) should be monitored\nregularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression. Urine should also be examined regularly for red\ncells which may precede hemorrhagic cystitis.\nDrug Interactions\nThe rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide reportedly are increased by chronic\nadministration of high doses of phenobarbital.\nThe physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving cyclo-\nphosphamide even though cyclophosphamide has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs,\nincluding other cytotoxic drugs.\nCyclophosphamide treatment, which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity,\npotentiates the effect of succinylcholine chloride.\nIf a patient has been treated with cyclophosphamide within 10 days of general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist\nshould be alerted.\nAdrenalectomy\nSince cyclophosphamide has been reported to be more toxic in adrenalectomized dogs, adjustment of the doses\nof both replacement steroids and cyclophosphamide may be necessary for the adrenalectomized patient.\nWound Healing\nCyclophosphamide may interfere with normal wound healing.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility\nSee WARNINGS for information on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.\nPregnancy\nPregnancy Category D\nSee WARNINGS.\nNursing Mothers\nCyclophosphamide is excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions and the\npotential for tumorigenicity shown for cyclophosphamide in humans, a decision should be made whether to\ndiscontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\nPediatric Use\nThe safety profile of CYTOXAN (cyclophosphamide) in pediatric patients is similar to that of the adult population\n(see ADVERSE REACTIONS).\nGeriatric Use\nInsufficient data from clinical studies of CYTOXAN for malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, mycosis\nfungoides, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, and breast carcinoma are available for patients 65 years of age and older\nto determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In two clinical trials in which cyclophosphamide\nwas compared with paclitaxel, each in combination with cisplatin, for the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma,\n154 (28%) of 552 patients who received cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin were 65 years or older. Subset analyses\n(<65 versus >65 years) from these trials, published reports of clinical trials of cyclophosphamide-containing\nregimens in breast cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and postmarketing experience suggest that elderly\npatients may be more susceptible to cyclophosphamide toxicities. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient\nshould be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range and adjusting as necessary based on\npatient response (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Treatment of Malignant Diseases).\nO\nP\nNH\nN(CH2CH2Cl)2\u2022H2O\nO\nPage 93\n \nADVERSE REACTIONS\nInformation on adverse reactions associated with the use of CYTOXAN (cyclophosphamide) is arranged according\nto body system affected or type of reaction. The adverse reactions are listed in order of decreasing incidence.\nThe most serious adverse reactions are described in the WARNINGS section.\nReproductive System\nSee WARNINGS for information on impairment of fertility.\nDigestive System\nNausea and vomiting commonly occur with cyclophosphamide therapy. Anorexia and, less frequently, abdom-\ninal discomfort or pain and diarrhea may occur. There are isolated reports of hemorrhagic colitis, oral mucosal\nulceration and jaundice occurring during therapy. These adverse drug effects generally remit when cyclophos-\nphamide treatment is stopped.\nSkin and Its Structures\nAlopecia occurs commonly in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. The hair can be expected to grow back\nafter treatment with the drug or even during continued drug treatment, though it may be different in texture or\ncolor. Skin rash occurs occasionally in patients receiving the drug. Pigmentation of the skin and changes in\nnails can occur. Very rare reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been\nreceived during postmarketing surveillance; due to the nature of spontaneous adverse event reporting, a definitive\ncausal relationship to cyclophosphamide has not been established. \nHematopoietic System\nLeukopenia occurs in patients treated with cyclophosphamide, is related to the dose of drug, and can be used\nas a dosage guide. Leukopenia of less than 2000 cells/mm3 develops commonly in patients treated with an\ninitial loading dose of the drug, and less frequently in patients maintained on smaller doses. The degree of\nneutropenia is particularly important because it correlates with a reduction in resistance to infections. Fever\nwithout documented infection has been reported in neutropenic patients.\nThrombocytopenia or anemia develop occasionally in patients treated with CYTOXAN. These hematologic ef-\nfects usually can be reversed by reducing the drug dose or by interrupting treatment. Recovery from leukope-\nnia usually begins in 7 to 10 days after cessation of therapy.\nUrinary System\nSee WARNINGS for information on cystitis and urinary bladder fibrosis.\nHemorrhagic ureteritis and renal tubular necrosis have been reported to occur in patients treated with cyclo-\nphosphamide. Such lesions usually resolve following cessation of therapy.\nInfections\nSee WARNINGS for information on reduced host resistance to infections.\nCarcinogenesis\nSee WARNINGS for information on carcinogenesis.\nRespiratory System\nInterstitial pneumonitis has been reported as part of the postmarketing experience. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis\nhas been reported in patients receiving high doses of cyclophosphamide over a prolonged period.\nOther\nAnaphylactic reactions have been reported; death has also been reported in association with this event. Possible\ncross-sensitivity with other alkylating agents has been reported. SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion)\nhas been reported with the use of cyclophosphamide. Malaise and asthenia have been reported as part of the\npostmarketing experience.\nOVERDOSAGE\nNo specific antidote for cyclophosphamide is known. Overdosage should be managed with supportive\nmeasures, including appropriate treatment for any concurrent infection, myelosuppression, or cardiac toxicity should\nit occur.\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\nTreatment of Malignant Diseases\nAdults and Children\nWhen used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of CYTOXAN for patients with no hematologic\ndeficiency usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days.\nOther intravenous regimens include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly.\nOral CYTOXAN dosing is usually in the range of 1 to 5 mg/kg/day for both initial and maintenance dosing.\nMany other regimens of intravenous and oral CYTOXAN have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in\naccord with evidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective\nguide for regulating dosage. Transient decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm3\n(following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated\nwithout serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia.\nWhen CYTOXAN is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose of\nCYTOXAN as well as that of the other drugs.\nCYTOXAN and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending\nupon the dialysis system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes\nin pharmacokinetic parameters of CYTOXAN metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need\nfor CYTOXAN dosage modification in patients with renal function impairment.\nTreatment of Nonmalignant Diseases\nBiopsy Proven \u201cMinimal Change\u201d Nephrotic Syndrome In Children\nAn oral dose of 2.5 to 3 mg/kg daily for a period of 60 to 90 days is recommended. In males, the incidence of\noligospermia and azoospermia increases if the duration of CYTOXAN treatment exceeds 60 days. Treatment\nbeyond 90 days increases the probability of sterility. Adrenocorticosteroid therapy may be tapered and discon-\ntinued during the course of CYTOXAN therapy. See PRECAUTIONS concerning hematologic monitoring.\nPreparation and Handling of Solutions\nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to adminis-\ntration, whenever solution and container permit.\nAdd the diluent to the vial and shake it vigorously to dissolve. If the powder fails to dissolve immediately and\ncompletely, it is advisable to allow the vial to stand for a few minutes. Use the quantity of diluent shown below\nto constitute the product:\nFor Direct Injection\nCYTOXAN should be prepared for parenteral use by adding 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution. Solutions of CYTOXAN\nmay be injected intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or intrapleurally if constituted by adding 0.9%\nsterile sodium chloride solution.\nFor Infusion\nCYTOXAN (cyclophosphamide) may be prepared for parenteral use by infusion using any of the following methods:\n1. CYTOXAN constituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride may be infused without further dilution.\n2.

Administer only as an intravenous infusion [see Dosage and \n51 \nAdministration (2.5)]. \n52 \n\u2022 First Infusion:  Initiate infusion at a rate of 50 mg/hr. In the absence of \n53 \ninfusion toxicity, increase infusion rate by 50 mg/hr increments every \n54 \n30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. \n55 \n\u2022 Subsequent Infusions:  Initiate infusion at a rate of 100 mg/hr.  In the \n56 \nabsence of infusion toxicity, increase rate by 100 mg/hr increments at \n57 \n30-minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr. \n58 \n\u2022 Interrupt the infusion or slow the infusion rate for infusion reactions \n59 \n[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].  Continue the \n60 \ninfusion at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of symptoms. \n61 \n2.2 Recommended Dose for Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (NHL) \n62 \n The recommended dose is 375 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion \n63 \naccording to the following schedules: \n64 \n\u2022 Relapsed or Refractory, Low-Grade or Follicular, CD20-Positive, \n65 \nB-Cell NHL \n66 \nAdminister once weekly for 4 or 8 doses. \n67 \n\u2022 Retreatment for Relapsed or Refractory, Low-Grade or Follicular, \n68 \nCD20-Positive, B-Cell NHL \n69 \nAdminister once weekly for 4 doses. \n70 \n\u2022 Previously Untreated, Follicular, CD20-Positive, B-Cell NHL \n71 \nAdminister on Day 1 of each cycle of CVP chemotherapy, for up to \n72 \n8 doses. \n73 \n\u2022 Non-progressing, Low-Grade, CD20-Positive, B-cell NHL, after \n74 \nfirst-line CVP chemotherapy \n75 \nFollowing completion of 6\u22128 cycles of CVP chemotherapy, administer \n76 \nonce weekly for 4 doses at 6-month intervals to a maximum of \n77 \n16 doses. \n78 \n\u2022 Diffuse Large B-Cell NHL \n79 \nAdminister on Day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy for up to \n80 \n8 infusions. \n81 \n2.3 Recommended Dose as a Component of Zevalin\uf8e8 \n82 \n\u2022 Infuse rituximab 250 mg/m2 within 4 hours prior to the administration \n83 \nof Indium-111-(In-111-) Zevalin and within 4 hours prior to the \n84 \nadministration of Yttrium-90- (Y-90-) Zevalin. \n85 \nPage 99\n \n \n \n\u2022 Administer Rituxan and In-111-Zevalin 7-9 days prior to Rituxan and \n86 \nY-90- Zevalin. \n87 \n\u2022 Refer to the Zevalin package insert for full prescribing information \n88 \nregarding the Zevalin therapeutic regimen. \n89 \n2.4 Recommended Dose for Rheumatoid Arthritis \n90 \n\u2022 Two-1000 mg intravenous infusions separated by 2 weeks. \n91 \n\u2022 Glucocorticoids administered as methylprednisolone 100 mg \n92 \nintravenous or its equivalent 30 minutes prior to each infusion are \n93 \nrecommended to reduce the incidence and severity of infusion reactions.  \n94 \nSafety and efficacy of retreatment have not been established in \n95 \ncontrolled trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. \n96 \n\u2022  Rituxan is given in combination with methotrexate. \n97 \n2.5 Recommended Concomitant Medications \n98 \n Premedicate before each infusion with acetaminophen and an \n99 \nantihistamine. \n100 \n2.6 Preparation for Administration \n101 \n Use appropriate aseptic technique.  Parenteral drug products should be \n102 \ninspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to \n103 \nadministration.  Do not use vial if particulates or discoloration is present.  \n104 \nWithdraw the necessary amount of Rituxan and dilute to a final \n105 \nconcentration of 1 to 4 mg/mL in an infusion bag containing either 0.9% \n106 \nSodium Chloride, USP, or 5% Dextrose in Water, USP.  Gently invert the \n107 \nbag to mix the solution.  Do not mix or dilute with other drugs.

Severe \n117 \nreactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of \n118 \n30\u2212120 minutes.  Rituxan-induced infusion reactions and sequelae include \n119 \nurticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary \n120 \ninfiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, \n121 \nventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, or anaphylactoid events. \n122 \n Premedicate patients with an antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to \n123 \ndosing.  Institute medical management (e.g. glucocorticoids, epinephrine, \n124 \nbronchodilators, or oxygen) for infusion reactions as needed.  Depending \n125 \non the severity of the infusion reaction and the required interventions, \n126 \nconsider resumption of the infusion at a minimum 50% reduction in rate \n127 \nafter symptoms have resolved.  Closely monitor the following patients: \n128 \nthose with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those who \n129 \nPage 100\n \n \n \nexperienced prior cardiopulmonary adverse reactions, and those with high \n130 \nnumbers of circulating malignant cells ( \u2265 25,000/mm3). [See Boxed \n131 \nWarning, Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1).] \n132 \n5.2 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) \n133 \n Rapid reduction in tumor volume followed by acute renal failure, \n134 \nhyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hyperphosphatemia, can \n135 \noccur within 12\u221224 hours after the first infusion.  Fatal TLS cases have \n136 \noccurred after administration of Rituxan.  A high number of circulating \n137 \nmalignant cells ( \u2265 25,000/mm3) or high tumor burden confers a greater \n138 \nrisk of TLS after rituximab.  Consider prophylaxis for TLS in patients at \n139 \nhigh risk.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and \n140 \nfluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as \n141 \nindicated. [See Boxed Warning.] \n142 \n5.3 Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions  \n143 \n Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, can occur in \n144 \npatients treated with Rituxan.  These reactions include paraneoplastic \n145 \npemphigus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, \n146 \nvesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.  The onset of \n147 \nthese reactions has varied from 1\u221213 weeks following Rituxan exposure.  \n148 \nDiscontinue Rituxan in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous \n149 \nreaction.  The safety of readministration of Rituxan to patients with severe \n150 \nmucocutaneous reactions has not been determined. [See Boxed Warning, \n151 \nAdverse Reactions (6.1, 6.4).] \n152 \n5.4 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n153 \n JC virus infection resulting in PML and death can occur in \n154 \nRituxan-treated patients with hematologic malignancies or with \n155 \nautoimmune diseases.  The majority of patients with hematologic \n156 \nmalignancies diagnosed with PML received Rituxan in combination with \n157 \nchemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  The \n158 \npatients with autoimmune diseases had prior or concurrent \n159 \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within \n160 \n12 months of their last infusion of Rituxan. \n161 \n Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset \n162 \nneurologic manifestations.  Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited \n163 \nto, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture.  \n164 \nDiscontinue Rituxan and consider discontinuation or reduction of any \n165 \nconcomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who \n166 \ndevelop PML. [See Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.4).] \n167 \n5.5 Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation \n168 \n Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic \n169 \nfailure, and death can occur in patients with hematologic malignancies \n170 \ntreated with Rituxan.  The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was \n171 \napproximately 4 months after the initiation of Rituxan and approximately \n172 \none month after the last dose. \n173 \nPage 101\n \n \n \n Screen patients at high risk of HBV infection before initiation of \n174 \nRituxan.  Closely monitor carriers of hepatitis B for clinical and laboratory \n175 \nsigns of active HBV infection for several months following Rituxan \n176 \ntherapy.  Discontinue Rituxan and any concomitant chemotherapy in \n177 \npatients who develop viral hepatitis, and institute appropriate treatment \n178 \nincluding antiviral therapy.  Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of \n179 \nresuming Rituxan in patients who develop hepatitis subsequent to HBV \n180 \nreactivation. [See Adverse Reactions (6.4).] \n181 \n5.6 Other Viral Infections \n182 \n The following additional serious viral infections, either new, \n183 \nreactivated, or exacerbated, have been identified in clinical studies or \n184 \npostmarketing reports.  The majority of patients received Rituxan in \n185 \ncombination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell \n186 \ntransplant.  These viral infections included cytomegalovirus, herpes \n187 \nsimplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and \n188 \nhepatitis C.  In some cases, the viral infections occurred as late as one year \n189 \nfollowing discontinuation of Rituxan and have resulted in death. [See \n190 \nAdverse Reactions (6.1, 6.4).] \n191 \n5.7 Cardiovascular \n192 \n Discontinue infusions for serious or life-threatening cardiac \n193 \narrhythmias.  Perform cardiac monitoring during and after all infusions of \n194 \nRituxan for patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias, or \n195 \nwho have a history of arrhythmia or angina. [See Adverse Reactions (6.4).] \n196 \n5.8 Renal \n197 \n Severe, including fatal, renal toxicity can occur after Rituxan \n198 \nadministration in patients with hematologic malignancies.  Renal toxicity \n199 \nhas occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells \n200 \n( \u2265 25,000/mm3) or high tumor burden who experience tumor lysis \n201 \nsyndrome and in patients with NHL administered concomitant cisplatin \n202 \ntherapy during clinical trials.  The combination of cisplatin and Rituxan is \n203 \nnot an approved treatment regimen.  Use extreme caution if this non-\n204 \napproved combination is used in clinical trials and monitor closely for \n205 \nsigns of renal failure.  Consider discontinuation of Rituxan for patients \n206 \nwith a rising serum creatinine or oliguria. \n207 \n5.9 Bowel Obstruction and Perforation \n208 \n Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases \n209 \nleading to death, can occur in patients receiving Rituxan in combination \n210 \nwith chemotherapy.  In postmarketing reports, the mean time to \n211 \ndocumented gastrointestinal perforation was 6 (range 1\u221277) days in \n212 \npatients with NHL. Perform a thorough diagnostic evaluation and institute \n213 \nappropriate treatment for complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in \n214 \nthe course of Rituxan therapy. [See Adverse Reactions (6.4).] \n215 \nPage 102\n \n \n \n5.10 \nImmunization \n216 \n The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following Rituxan \n217 \ntherapy has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is \n218 \nnot recommended.  Physicians should review the vaccination status of \n219 \npatients with RA being considered for Rituxan treatment and follow the \n220 \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for adult \n221 \nvaccination with non-live vaccines intended to prevent infectious disease \n222 \nprior to therapy. \n223 \n For NHL patients, the benefits of primary or booster vaccinations \n224 \nshould be weighted against the risks of delay in initiation of Rituxan \n225 \ntherapy. \n226 \n5.11 \nLaboratory Monitoring \n227 \n Because Rituxan binds to all CD20-positive B lymphocytes (malignant \n228 \nand nonmalignant), obtain complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet \n229 \ncounts at regular intervals during Rituxan therapy and more frequently in \n230 \npatients who develop cytopenias [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  The \n231 \nduration of cytopenias caused by Rituxan can extend months beyond the \n232 \ntreatment period. \n233 \n5.12 \nConcomitant Use with Biologic Agents and Disease Modifying \n234 \nAnti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDS) other than Methotrexate in \n235 \nRA \n236 \n Limited data are available on the safety of the use of biologic agents or \n237 \nDMARDs other than methotrexate in patients exhibiting peripheral B-cell \n238 \ndepletion following treatment with rituximab.  Observe patients closely for \n239 \nsigns of infection if biologic agents and/or DMARDs are used \n240 \nconcomitantly. \n241 \n5.13 \nUse in RA Patients Who Have Not Had Prior Inadequate \n242 \nResponse to Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Antagonists \n243 \n While efficacy of Rituxan was supported in two well-controlled trials in \n244 \npatients with RA with prior inadequate responses to non-biologic \n245 \nDMARDs, a favorable risk benefit relationship has not been established in \n246 \nthis population.  The use of Rituxan in patients with RA who have not had \n247 \nprior inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonists is not \n248 \nrecommended [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. \n249 \n5.14 \nRetreatment in Patients with RA \n250 \n Safety and efficacy of retreatment have not been established in \n251 \ncontrolled trials.  A limited number of patients have received two to \n252 \nfive courses (two infusions per course) of treatment in an uncontrolled \n253 \nsetting.  In clinical trials in patients with RA, most of the patients who \n254 \nreceived additional courses did so 24 weeks after the previous course and \n255 \nnone were retreated sooner than 16 weeks. \n256 \n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \n257 \n The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other \n258 \nsections of the labeling: \n259 \nPage 103\n \n \n \n\u2022 Infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \n260 \n\u2022 Tumor lysis syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \n261 \n\u2022 Mucocutaneous reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \n262 \n\u2022 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [see Warnings and \n263 \nPrecautions (5.4)] \n264 \n\u2022 Hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis [see Warnings and \n265 \nPrecautions (5.5)] \n266 \n\u2022 Other viral infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] \n267 \n\u2022 Cardiac arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] \n268 \n\u2022 Renal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] \n269 \n\u2022 Bowel obstruction and perforation [see Warnings and Precautions \n270 \n(5.9)] \n271 \n \n272 \n The most common adverse reactions of Rituxan (incidence  \u2265 25%) \n273 \nobserved in patients with NHL are infusion reactions, fever, chills, \n274 \ninfection, asthenia, and lymphopenia. \n275 \n The most important serious adverse reactions of Rituxan are infusion \n276 \nreactions, tumor lysis syndrome, mucocutaneous toxicities, hepatitis B \n277 \nreactivation with fulminant hepatitis, PML, other viral infections, cardiac \n278 \narrhythmias, renal toxicity, and bowel obstruction and perforation. \n279 \n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma \n280 \n Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, \n281 \nadverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be \n282 \ndirectly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not \n283 \nreflect the rates observed in practice. \n284 \n The data described below reflect exposure to Rituxan in 1606 patients, \n285 \nwith exposures ranging from a single infusion up to 6\u22128 months.  Rituxan \n286 \nwas studied in both single-agent and active-controlled trials (n = 356 and \n287 \nn= 1250).  These data were obtained in adults with low-grade, follicular, \n288 \nor DLBCL NHL.  Most patients received Rituxan as an infusion of 375 \n289 \nmg/m2 per infusion, given as a single agent weekly for up to 8 doses, in \n290 \ncombination with chemotherapy for up to 8 doses, or following \n291 \nchemotherapy for up to 16 doses. \n292 \nInfusion Reactions \n293 \n In the majority of patients with NHL, infusion reactions consisting of \n294 \nfever, chills/rigors, nausea, pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, headache, \n295 \nbronchospasm, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, or \n296 \nhypertension occurred during the first Rituxan infusion.  Infusion reactions \n297 \ntypically occurred within 30 to 120 minutes of beginning the first infusion \n298 \nand resolved with slowing or interruption of the Rituxan infusion and with \n299 \nsupportive care (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, and intravenous \n300 \nsaline).  The incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first \n301 \ninfusion (77%) and decreased with each subsequent infusion. [See Boxed \n302 \nWarning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] \n303 \nPage 104\n \n \n \nInfections \n304 \n Serious infections (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, \n305 \noccurred in less than 5% of patients with NHL in the single-arm studies.  \n306 \nThe overall incidence of infections was 31% (bacterial 19%, viral 10%, \n307 \nunknown 6%, and fungal 1%). [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4), (5.5), \n308 \n(5.6).] \n309 \n In randomized, controlled studies where Rituxan was administered \n310 \nfollowing chemotherapy for the treatment of follicular or low-grade NHL, \n311 \nthe rate of infection was higher among patients who received Rituxan. In \n312 \ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients, viral infections occurred more \n313 \nfrequently in those who received Rituxan. \n314 \nCytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia \n315 \n In patients with NHL receiving rituximab monotherapy, NCI-CTC \n316 \nGrade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients.  These \n317 \nincluded lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia \n318 \n(3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of lymphopenia \n319 \nwas 14 days (range, 1\u2212588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, \n320 \n2\u2212116 days).  A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red \n321 \ncell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following Rituxan \n322 \ntherapy occurred during the single-arm studies. \n323 \n In studies of monotherapy, Rituxan-induced B-cell depletion occurred \n324 \nin 70% to 80% of patients with NHL.  Decreased IgM and IgG serum \n325 \nlevels occurred in 14% of these patients. \n326 \nSingle-Agent Rituxan \n327 \n Adverse reactions in Table 1 occurred in 356 patients with relapsed or \n328 \nrefractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL treated in \n329 \nsingle-arm studies of Rituxan administered as a single agent [see Clinical \n330 \nStudies (14.1)].

The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently (\u2265 5%) in \n344 \npatients receiving R-CVP compared to CVP alone:  rash (17% vs. 5%), \n345 \ncough (15% vs. 6%), flushing (14% vs. 3%), rigors (10% vs. 2%), pruritus \n346 \n(10% vs. 1%), neutropenia (8% vs. 3%), and chest tightness (7% vs. 1%). \n347 \n[See Clinical Studies (14.2).] \n348 \n In Study 5, the following adverse reactions were reported more \n349 \nfrequently ( \u2265 5%) in patients receiving Rituxan following CVP compared \n350 \nto patients who received no further therapy:  fatigue (39% vs. 14%), \n351 \nanemia (35% vs. 20%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (30% vs. 18%), \n352 \ninfections (19% vs. 9%), pulmonary toxicity (18% vs. 10%), \n353 \nhepato-biliary toxicity (17% vs. 7%), rash and/or pruritus (17% vs. 5%), \n354 \narthralgia (12% vs. 3%), and weight gain (11% vs. 4%).  Neutropenia was \n355 \nthe only Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction that occurred more frequently \n356 \nPage 107\n \n \n \n(\u2265 2%) in the Rituxan arm compared with those who received no further \n357 \ntherapy (4% vs. 1%). [See Clinical Studies (14.3).] \n358 \nRituxan in Combination with Chemotherapy for DLBCL \n359 \n In Studies 6 and 7, [see Clinical Studies (14.4)], the following adverse \n360 \nreactions, regardless of severity, were reported more frequently ( \u2265 5%) in \n361 \npatients age  \u2265 60 years receiving R-CHOP as compared to CHOP alone: \n362 \npyrexia (56% vs. 46%), lung disorder (31% vs. 24%), cardiac disorder \n363 \n(29% vs. 21%), and chills (13% vs. 4%).  Detailed safety data collection in \n364 \nthese studies was primarily limited to Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions and \n365 \nserious adverse reactions. \n366 \n In Study 7, a review of cardiac toxicity determined that supraventricular \n367 \narrhythmias or tachycardia accounted for most of the difference in cardiac \n368 \ndisorders (4.5% for R-CHOP vs. 1.0% for CHOP). \n369 \n The following Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred more frequently \n370 \namong patients in the R-CHOP arm compared with those in the CHOP \n371 \narm: thrombocytopenia (9% vs. 7%) and lung disorder (6% vs. 3%).  \n372 \nOther Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurring more frequently among \n373 \npatients receiving R-CHOP were viral infection (Study 7), neutropenia \n374 \n(Studies 7 and 8), and anemia (Study 8). \n375 \n6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Rheumatoid Arthritis \n376 \n The types of adverse reactions observed in patients with RA were \n377 \nsimilar to those seen in patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma [see \n378 \nWarnings and Precautions (5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  Specific safety \n379 \nconsiderations in this indication are discussed below. \n380 \n Where specific percentages are noted, these data are based on \n381 \n938 patients treated in Phase 2 and 3 studies of Rituxan (2 \u00d7 1000 mg) or \n382 \nplacebo administered in combination with methotrexate. \n383 \n \n384 \nPage 108\n \n \n \nTable 2 \nIncidence of All Adverse Reactions* Occurring in  \u2265 2%  \nand at Least 1% Greater than Placebo Among Rheumatoid \nArthritis Patients in Clinical Studies Up to Week 24 (Pooled) \nPreferred Term \nPlacebo + MTX \nN = 398 \nn (%) \nRituxan + MTX \nN = 540 \nn (%) \nHypertension \n21 (5) \n43 (8) \nNausea \n19 (5) \n41 (8) \nUpper Respiratory Tract \nInfection \n23 (6) \n37 (7) \nArthralgia \n14 (4) \n31 (6) \nPyrexia \n8 (2) \n27 (5) \nPruritus \n5 (1) \n26 (5) \nChills \n9 (2) \n16 (3) \nDyspepsia \n3 ( < 1) \n16 (3) \nRhinitis \n6 (2) \n14 (3) \nParesthesia \n3 ( < 1) \n12 (2) \nUrticaria \n3 ( < 1) \n12 (2) \nAbdominal Pain Upper \n4 (1) \n11 (2) \nThroat Irritation \n0 (0) \n11 (2) \nAnxiety \n5 (1) \n9 (2) \nMigraine \n2 ( < 1) \n9 (2) \nAsthenia \n1 ( < 1) \n9 (2) \n*Coded using MedDRA. \n \n385 \nInfusion Reactions \n386 \n In Rituxan RA placebo-controlled studies, 32% of Rituxan-treated \n387 \npatients experienced an adverse reaction during or within 24 hours \n388 \nfollowing their first infusion, compared to 23% of placebo-treated patients \n389 \nreceiving their first infusion.  The incidence of adverse reactions during \n390 \nthe 24-hour period following the second infusion, Rituxan or placebo, \n391 \ndecreased to 11% and 13%, respectively.  Acute infusion reactions \n392 \n(manifested by fever, chills, rigors, pruritus, urticaria/rash, angioedema, \n393 \nsneezing, throat irritation, cough, and/or bronchospasm, with or without \n394 \nassociated hypotension or hypertension) were experienced by 27% of \n395 \nRituxan-treated patients following their first infusion, compared to 19% of \n396 \nplacebo-treated patients receiving their first placebo infusion.  The \n397 \nincidence of these acute infusion reactions following the second infusion \n398 \nof Rituxan or placebo decreased to 9% and 11%, respectively.  Serious \n399 \nacute infusion reactions were experienced by  < 1% of patients in either \n400 \ntreatment group.  Acute infusion reactions required dose modification \n401 \n(stopping, slowing, or interruption of the infusion) in 10% and 2% of \n402 \npatients receiving rituximab or placebo, respectively, after the first course.  \n403 \nThe proportion of patients experiencing acute infusion reactions decreased \n404 \nwith subsequent courses of Rituxan.  The administration of intravenous \n405 \nglucocorticoids prior to Rituxan infusions reduced the incidence and \n406 \nseverity of such reactions, however, there was no clear benefit from the \n407 \nPage 109\n \n \n \nadministration of oral glucocorticoids for the prevention of acute infusion \n408 \nreactions.  Patients in clinical studies also received antihistamines and \n409 \nacetaminophen prior to Rituxan infusions. \n410 \nInfections \n411 \n In RA clinical studies, 39% of patients in the Rituxan group \n412 \nexperienced an infection of any type compared to 34% of patients in the \n413 \nplacebo group.  The most common infections were nasopharyngitis, upper \n414 \nrespiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and \n415 \nsinusitis. \n416 \n The incidence of serious infections was 2% in the Rituxan-treated \n417 \npatients and 1% in the placebo group.  One fatal infection \n418 \n(bronchopneumonia) occurred with rituximab monotherapy during the \n419 \n24-week, placebo-controlled period in one of the Phase 2 RA studies.  In \n420 \n107 Rituxan-treated RA patients with active disease, subsequent treatment \n421 \nwith a TNF inhibitor was associated with a higher rate of serious \n422 \ninfections.  Six serious infections were observed in 100.8 patient years \n423 \n(0.06 per patient year) prior to exposure and 9 were observed in 97.8 \n424 \npatient years (0.09 per patient year) after exposure. \n425 \nCardiac Adverse Reactions \n426 \n The incidence of serious cardiovascular events in the double-blind part \n427 \nof the RA clinical trials was 1.7% and 1.3% in Rituxan and placebo \n428 \ntreatment groups, respectively.  Three cardiovascular deaths occurred \n429 \nduring the double-blind period of the RA studies including all rituximab \n430 \nregimens (3/769 = 0.4%) as compared to none in the placebo treatment \n431 \ngroup (0/389). \n432 \n Since patients with RA are at increased risk for cardiovascular events \n433 \ncompared with the general population, patients with RA should be \n434 \nmonitored throughout the infusion and Rituxan should be discontinued in \n435 \nthe event of a serious or life-threatening cardiac event. \n436 \nHypophosphatemia and hyperuricemia \n437 \n In the 24-week, double-blind RA clinical trial program, newly-\n438 \noccurring hypophosphatemia (<2.0 mg/dl) was observed in 12% (67/540) \n439 \nof patients on Rituxan versus 10% (39/398) of patients on placebo.  \n440 \nHypophosphatemia was more common in patients who received \n441 \ncorticosteroids. Newly-occurring hyperuricemia (>10 mg/dl) was observed \n442 \nin 1.5% (8/540) of patients on Rituxan versus 0.3% (1/398) of patients on \n443 \nplacebo. \n444 \n \nAt any time after treatment with up to seven courses of Rituxan, at \n445 \nleast one episode of newly-occurring hypophosphatemia was observed in \n446 \n23% (245/1048) of patients and newly-occurring hyperuricemia was \n447 \nobserved in 3% (32/1048) of patients. \n448 \n \n449 \n6.3 Immunogenicity \n450 \n As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.  \n451 \nThe observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) \n452 \nPage 110\n \n \n \npositivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including \n453 \nassay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, \n454 \ntiming of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying \n455 \ndisease.  For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to \n456 \nRituxan with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be \n457 \nmisleading. \n458 \n Using an ELISA assay, anti-human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) \n459 \nwas detected in 4 of 356 (1.1%) patients with low-grade or follicular NHL \n460 \nreceiving single-agent Rituxan.  Three of the four patients had an objective \n461 \nclinical response. \n462 \n A total of 118/1053 patients (11%) with RA tested positive for HACA \n463 \nat any time after treatment with Rituxan.  Limited data are available on the \n464 \nsafety or efficacy of Rituxan retreatment in patients who develop HACA.  \n465 \nOf the 8 patients who experienced serious acute infusion reactions, 2 were \n466 \nsubsequently found to be HACA-positive.  Approximately 12% (14/118) \n467 \nof patients who were HACA-positive had a subsequent infusion reaction \n468 \nof any severity.  The clinical relevance of HACA formation in \n469 \nrituximab-treated patients is unclear. \n470 \n6.4 Postmarketing Experience \n471 \n The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-\n472 \napproval use of Rituxan in hematologic malignancies.  Because these \n473 \nreactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is \n474 \nnot always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a \n475 \ncausal relationship to drug exposure.   \nDecisions to include these \n476 \nreactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following \n477 \nfactors:  (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) \n478 \nstrength of causal connection to Rituxan. \n479 \n\u2022 Hematologic:  prolonged pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late-\n480 \nonset neutropenia, hyperviscosity syndrome in Waldenstrom\u2019s \n481 \nmacroglobulinemia. \n482 \n\u2022 Cardiac:  fatal cardiac failure. \n483 \n\u2022 Immune/Autoimmune Events:  uveitis, optic neuritis, systemic \n484 \nvasculitis, pleuritis, lupus-like syndrome, serum sickness, polyarticular \n485 \narthritis, and vasculitis with rash. \n486 \n\u2022 Infection:  viral infections, including progressive multifocal \n487 \nleukoencephalopathy (PML), increase in fatal infections in \n488 \nHIV-associated lymphoma, and a reported increased incidence of Grade \n489 \n3 and 4 infections in patients with previously treated lymphoma without \n490 \nknown HIV infection. \n491 \n\u2022 Neoplasia:  disease progression of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. \n492 \n\u2022 Skin:  severe mucocutaneous reactions. \n493 \n\u2022 Gastrointestinal:  bowel obstruction and perforation. \n494 \n\u2022 Pulmonary:  fatal bronchiolitis obliterans and pneumonitis (including \n495 \ninterstitial pneumonitis). \n496 \nPage 111\n \n \n \n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \n497 \n Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with Rituxan.  \n498 \nIn clinical trials of patients with RA, concomitant administration of \n499 \nmethotrexate or cyclophosphamide did not alter the pharmacokinetics of \n500 \nrituximab. \n501 \n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \n502 \n8.1 Pregnancy \n503 \n Category C:  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of \n504 \nrituximab in pregnant women.  Postmarketing data indicate that B-cell \n505 \nlymphocytopenia generally lasting less than six months can occur in \n506 \ninfants exposed to rituximab in-utero.  Rituximab was detected postnatally \n507 \nin the serum of infants exposed in-utero.   \n508 \n Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and moderate-severe rheumatoid arthritis \n509 \nare serious conditions that require treatment.  Rituximab should be used \n510 \nduring pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the \n511 \npotential risk to the fetus. \n512 \n Reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys at maternal exposures \n513 \nsimilar to human therapeutic exposures showed no evidence of teratogenic \n514 \neffects.  However, B-cell lymphoid tissue was reduced in the offspring of \n515 \ntreated dams.  The B-cell counts returned to normal levels, and \n516 \nimmunologic function was restored within 6 months of birth. \n517 \n  \n518 \n8.3 Nursing Mothers \n519 \n It is not known whether Rituxan is secreted into human milk.  However, \n520 \nRituxan is secreted in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys, and IgG \n521 \nis excreted in human milk.  Published data suggest that antibodies in \n522 \nbreast milk do not enter the neonatal and infant circulations in substantial \n523 \namounts.  The unknown risks to the infant from oral ingestion of Rituxan \n524 \nshould be weighed against the known benefits of breastfeeding. \n525 \n8.4 Pediatric Use \n526 \n The safety and effectiveness of Rituxan in pediatric patients have not \n527 \nbeen established. \n528 \n8.5 Geriatric Use \n529 \nDiffuse Large B-Cell NHL \n530 \n Among patients with DLBCL evaluated in three randomized, \n531 \nactive-controlled trials, 927 patients received Rituxan in combination with \n532 \nchemotherapy.  Of these, 396 (43%) were age 65 or greater and 123 (13%) \n533 \nwere age 75 or greater.  No overall differences in effectiveness were \n534 \nobserved between these patients and younger patients.  Cardiac adverse \n535 \nreactions, mostly supraventricular arrhythmias, occurred more frequently \n536 \namong elderly patients.  Serious pulmonary adverse reactions were also \n537 \nmore common among the elderly, including pneumonia and pneumonitis. \n538 \nPage 112\n \n \n \nLow-Grade or Follicular Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma \n539 \n Clinical studies of Rituxan in low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, \n540 \nB-cell NHL did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and \n541 \nover to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. \n542 \nRheumatoid Arthritis \n543 \n Among the 517 patients in the Phase 3 RA study, 16% were \n544 \n65\u221275 years old and 2% were 75 years old and older.  Response rates and \n545 \nadverse reactions were similar in the older (age \u2265 65 years) and younger \n546 \n(age < 65 years) patients. \n547 \n10 OVERDOSAGE \n548 \n There has been no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials.  \n549 \nSingle doses of up to 500 mg/m2 have been given in dose-escalation \n550 \nclinical trials. \n551 \n11 DESCRIPTION \n552 \n Rituxan\uf8e8 (rituximab) is a genetically engineered chimeric \n553 \nmurine/human monoclonal IgG1 kappa antibody directed against the CD20 \n554 \nantigen. Rituximab has an approximate molecular weight of 145 kD.  \n555 \nRituximab has a binding affinity for the CD20 antigen of approximately \n556 \n8.0 nM. \n557 \n Rituximab is produced by mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) \n558 \nsuspension culture in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic \n559 \ngentamicin.  Gentamicin is not detectable in the final product.  Rituxan is \n560 \na sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid concentrate for \n561 \nintravenous administration.  Rituxan is supplied at a concentration of \n562 \n10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use vials.  \n563 \nThe product is formulated in 9 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL \n564 \nsodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and Water for \n565 \nInjection.  The pH is 6.5. \n566 \n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \n567 \n12.1 \nMechanism of Action \n568 \n Rituximab binds specifically to the antigen CD20 (human \n569 \nB-lymphocyte-restricted differentiation antigen, Bp35), a hydrophobic \n570 \ntransmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 35 kD \n571 \nlocated on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes.  The antigen is expressed \n572 \non > 90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL), but the antigen is \n573 \nnot found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells or \n574 \nother normal tissues.  CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation \n575 \nprocess for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions \n576 \nas a calcium ion channel.  CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does \n577 \nnot internalize upon antibody binding.  Free CD20 antigen is not found in \n578 \nthe circulation. \n579 \n B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid \n580 \narthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis.  In this setting, B cells may \n581 \nbe acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, \n582 \nPage 113\n \n \n \nincluding through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other \n583 \nautoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or pro-\n584 \ninflammatory cytokine production. \n585 \n Mechanism of Action:  The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 \n586 \nantigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector \n587 \nfunctions to mediate B-cell lysis in vitro.  Possible mechanisms of cell \n588 \nlysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and \n589 \nantibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  The antibody has \n590 \nbeen shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma \n591 \nline. \n592 \n Normal Tissue Cross-reactivity:  Rituximab binding was observed on \n593 \nlymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority \n594 \nof B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes.  Little or no \n595 \nbinding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined. \n596 \n12.2 \nPharmacodynamics \n597 \n Administration of Rituxan resulted in a rapid and sustained depletion of \n598 \ncirculating and tissue-based B cells.  Among 166 patients in Study 1, \n599 \ncirculating CD19-positive B cells were depleted within the first three \n600 \nweeks with sustained depletion for up to 6 to 9 months post-treatment in \n601 \n83% of patients.  B-cell recovery began at approximately 6 months and \n602 \nmedian B-cell levels returned to normal by 12 months following \n603 \ncompletion of treatment. \n604 \n There were sustained and statistically significant reductions in both IgM \n605 \nand IgG serum levels observed from 5 through 11 months following \n606 \nrituximab administration; 14% of patients had IgM and/or IgG serum \n607 \nlevels below the normal range. \n608 \n In RA patients, treatment with Rituxan induced depletion of peripheral \n609 \nB lymphocytes, with all patients demonstrating near complete depletion \n610 \nwithin 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of Rituxan.  The majority of \n611 \npatients showed peripheral B-cell depletion for at least 6 months, followed \n612 \nby subsequent gradual recovery after that timepoint.  A small proportion \n613 \nof patients (4%) had prolonged peripheral B-cell depletion lasting more \n614 \nthan 3 years after a single course of treatment. \n615 \n In RA studies, total serum immunoglobulin levels, IgM, IgG, and IgA \n616 \nwere reduced at 6 months with the greatest change observed in IgM.  \n617 \nHowever, mean immunoglobulin levels remained within normal levels \n618 \nover the 24-week period.  Small proportions of patients experienced \n619 \ndecreases in IgM (7%), IgG (2%), and IgA (1%) levels below the lower \n620 \nlimit of normal.  The clinical consequences of decreases in \n621 \nimmunoglobulin levels in RA patients treated with Rituxan are unclear. \n622 \n Treatment with rituximab in patients with RA was associated with \n623 \nreduction of certain biologic markers of inflammation such as \n624 \ninterleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid protein \n625 \n(SAA), S100 A8/S100 A9 heterodimer complex (S100 A8/9), \n626 \nanti-citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), and RF. \n627 \nPage 114\n \n \n \n12.3 \nPharmacokinetics \n628 \n Pharmacokinetics were characterized in 203 NHL patients receiving \n629 \n375 mg/m2 rituximab weekly by IV infusion for 4 doses.  The mean Cmax \n630 \nincreased with each successive infusion and was 486 mcg/mL (range, \n631 \n78\u2212997 mcg/mL) following the fourth infusion. Peak and trough serum \n632 \nlevels of rituximab were inversely correlated with pretreatment circulating \n633 \nCD19-positive B cells and tumor burden.  Rituximab was detectable in the \n634 \nserum of patients 3 to 6 months after completion of treatment. \n635 \n The pharmacokinetic profile of rituximab when administered as \n636 \n6 infusions of 375 mg/m2 in combination with 6 cycles of CHOP \n637 \nchemotherapy was similar to that seen with rituximab alone. \n638 \n Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from 298 NHL \n639 \npatients who received rituximab once weekly or once every three weeks, \n640 \nthe estimated median terminal elimination half-life was 22 days (range, \n641 \n6.1 to 52 days).  Patients with higher CD19-positive cell counts or larger \n642 \nmeasurable tumor lesions at pretreatment had a higher clearance.  \n643 \nHowever, dose adjustment for pretreatment CD19 count or size of tumor \n644 \nlesion is not necessary.  Age and gender had no effect on the \n645 \npharmacokinetics of rituximab. \n646 \n Following administration of 2 doses of rituximab in patients with \n647 \nrheumatoid arthritis, the mean Cmax values were 183 mcg/mL (CV = 24%) \n648 \nfor the 2 \u00d7 500 mg dose and 370 mcg/mL (CV = 25%) for the \n649 \n2 \u00d7 1000 mg dose, respectively.  Following 2 \u00d7 1000 mg rituximab dose, \n650 \nmean volume of distribution at steady state was 4.3L (CV = 28%).  Mean \n651 \nsystemic serum clearance of rituximab was 0.01L/h (CV = 38%), and \n652 \nmean terminal elimination half-life after the second dose was 19 days \n653 \n(CV = 32%). \n654 \n Female patients with RA (n = 86) had a 37% lower clearance of \n655 \nrituximab than male patients with RA (n = 25).  The gender difference in \n656 \nrituximab clearance does not necessitate any dose adjustment because \n657 \nsafety and efficacy of rituximab do not appear to be influenced by gender. \n658 \n The pharmacokinetics of rituximab have not been studied in children \n659 \nand adolescents.  No formal studies were conducted to examine the effects \n660 \nof either renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \n661 \nrituximab. \n662 \n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \n663 \n13.1 \nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \n664 \n No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the \n665 \ncarcinogenic or mutagenic potential of Rituxan or to determine potential \n666 \neffects on fertility in males or females. \n667 \n13.2 \nAnimal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology \n668 \nReproductive Toxicology Studies \n669 \n An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed on \n670 \npregnant cynomolgus monkeys.  Pregnant animals received rituximab via \n671 \nPage 115\n \n \n \nthe intravenous route during early gestation (organogenesis period; post-\n672 \ncoitum days 20 through 50).  Rituximab was administered as loading \n673 \ndoses on post-coitum (PC) days 20, 21 and 22, at 15, 37.5 or \n674 \n75 mg/kg/day, and then weekly on PC Days 29, 36, 43 and 50, at 20, 50 or \n675 \n100 mg/kg/week.  The 100 mg/kg/week dose resulted in 80% of the \n676 \nexposure (based on AUC) of those achieved following a dose of 2 grams \n677 \nin humans. Rituximab crosses the monkey placenta.  Exposed offspring \n678 \ndid not exhibit any teratogenic effects but did have decreased lymphoid \n679 \ntissue B cells. \n680 \n A subsequent pre- and postnatal reproductive toxicity study in \n681 \ncynomolgus monkeys was completed to assess developmental effects \n682 \nincluding the recovery of B cells and immune function in infants exposed \n683 \nto rituximab in utero.  Animals were treated with a loading dose of 0, 15, \n684 \nor 75 mg/kg every day for 3 days, followed by weekly dosing with 0, 20, \n685 \nor 100 mg/kg dose. Subsets of pregnant females were treated from PC Day \n686 \n20 through postpartum Day 78, PC Day 76 through PC Day 134, and from \n687 \nPC day 132 through delivery and postpartum Day 28. Regardless of the \n688 \ntiming of treatment, decreased B cells and immunosuppression were noted \n689 \nin the offspring of rituximab-treated pregnant animals.  The B-cell counts \n690 \nreturned to normal levels, and immunologic function was restored within \n691 \n6 months postpartum. \n692 \n14 CLINICAL STUDIES \n693 \n14.1 \nRelapsed or Refractory, Low-Grade or Follicular, \n694 \nCD20-Positive, B-Cell NHL \n695 \n The safety and effectiveness of Rituxan in relapsed, refractory CD20+ \n696 \nNHL were demonstrated in 3 single-arm studies enrolling 296 patients. \n697 \nStudy 1 \n698 \n A multicenter, open-label, single-arm study was conducted in \n699 \n166 patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, B-cell \n700 \nNHL who received 375 mg/m2 of Rituxan given as an intravenous \n701 \ninfusion weekly for 4 doses.  Patients with tumor masses > 10 cm or with \n702 \n> 5000 lymphocytes/\u00b5L in the peripheral blood were excluded from the \n703 \nstudy. \n704 \n Results are summarized in Table 3.  The median time to onset of \n705 \nresponse was 50 days. Disease-related signs and symptoms (including \n706 \nB-symptoms) resolved in 64% (25/39) of those patients with such \n707 \nsymptoms at study entry. \n708 \nStudy 2 \n709 \n In a multicenter, single-arm study, 37 patients with relapsed or \n710 \nrefractory, low-grade NHL received 375 mg/m2 of Rituxan weekly for \n711 \n8 doses.  Results are summarized in Table 3. \n712 \nStudy 3 \n713 \n In a multicenter, single-arm study, 60 patients received 375 mg/m2 of \n714 \nRituxan weekly for 4 doses.  All patients had relapsed or refractory, \n715 \nPage 116\n \n \n \nlow-grade or follicular, B-cell NHL and had achieved an objective clinical \n716 \nresponse to Rituxan administered 3.8\u221235.6 months (median 14.5 months) \n717 \nprior to retreatment with Rituxan.  Of these 60 patients, 5 received more \n718 \nthan one additional course of Rituxan.  Results are summarized in Table 3. \n719 \nBulky Disease \n720 \n In pooled data from studies 1 and 3, 39 patients with bulky (single \n721 \nlesion > 10 cm in diameter) and relapsed or refractory, low-grade NHL \n722 \nreceived Rituxan 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 doses.

The \n732 \nmain outcome measure of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) \n733 \ndefined as the time from randomization to the first of progression, relapse, \n734 \nor death. \n735 \n Twenty-six percent of the study population was  > 60 years of age, 99% \n736 \nhad Stage III or IV disease, and 50% had an International Prognostic \n737 \nIndex (IPI) score  \u2265 2.  The results for PFS as determined by a blinded, \n738 \nindependent assessment of progression are presented in Table 4.  The \n739 \npoint estimates may be influenced by the presence of informative \n740 \ncensoring.

Patients were \n751 \nrandomized (1:1) to receive Rituxan, 375 mg/m2 intravenous infusion, \n752 \nonce weekly for 4 doses every 6 months for up to 16 doses or no further \n753 \ntherapeutic intervention.  The main outcome measure of the study was \n754 \nprogression-free survival defined as the time from randomization to \n755 \nprogression, relapse, or death.  Thirty-seven percent of the study \n756 \npopulation was  > 60 years of age, 99% had Stage III or IV disease, and \n757 \n63% had an IPI score  \u2265 2.   \n758 \n There was a reduction in the risk of progression, relapse, or death \n759 \n(hazard ratio estimate in the range of 0.36 to 0.49) for patients randomized \n760 \nto Rituxan as compared to those who received no additional treatment. \n761 \n14.4 \nDiffuse Large B-Cell NHL (DLBCL) \n762 \n The safety and effectiveness of Rituxan were evaluated in three \n763 \nrandomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter studies with a \n764 \ncollective enrollment of 1854 patients.  Patients with previously untreated \n765 \ndiffuse large B-cell NHL received Rituxan in combination with \n766 \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or \n767 \nother anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. \n768 \nStudy 6 \n769 \n A total of 632 patients age  \u2265 60 years with DLBCL (including primary \n770 \nmediastinal B-cell lymphoma) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment \n771 \nwith CHOP or R-CHOP.  Patients received 6 or 8 cycles of CHOP, each \n772 \ncycle lasting 21 days.  All patients in the R-CHOP arm received 4 doses of \n773 \nRituxan 375 mg/m2 on Days -7 and -3 (prior to Cycle 1) and 48\u221272 hours \n774 \nprior to Cycles 3 and 5.  Patients who received 8 cycles of CHOP also \n775 \nreceived Rituxan prior to cycle 7.  The main outcome measure of the study \n776 \nwas progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to \n777 \nthe first of progression, relapse, or death.  Responding patients underwent \n778 \na second randomization to receive Rituxan or no further therapy. \n779 \n Among all enrolled patients, 62% had centrally confirmed DLBCL \n780 \nhistology, 73% had Stage III\u2212IV disease, 56% had IPI scores  \u2265 2, 86% \n781 \nPage 118\n \n \n \nhad ECOG performance status of  < 2, 57% had elevated LDH levels, and \n782 \n30% had two or more extranodal disease sites involved.  Efficacy results \n783 \nare presented in Table 5.  These results reflect a statistical approach which \n784 \nallows for an evaluation of Rituxan administered in the induction setting \n785 \nthat excludes any potential impact of Rituxan given after the second \n786 \nrandomization. \n787 \n Analysis of results after the second randomization in Study 6 \n788 \ndemonstrates that for patients randomized to R-CHOP, additional Rituxan \n789 \nexposure beyond induction was not associated with further improvements \n790 \nin progression-free survival or overall survival. \n791 \nStudy 7 \n792 \n A total of 399 patients with DLBCL, age  \u2265 60 years, were randomized \n793 \nin a 1:1 ratio to receive CHOP or R-CHOP.  All patients received up to \n794 \neight 3-week cycles of CHOP induction; patients in the R-CHOP arm \n795 \nreceived Rituxan 375 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each cycle.  The main outcome \n796 \nmeasure of the study was event-free survival, defined as the time from \n797 \nrandomization to relapse, progression, change in therapy, or death from \n798 \nany cause.  Among all enrolled patients, 80% had Stage III or IV disease, \n799 \n60% of patients had an age-adjusted IPI  \u2265 2, 80% had ECOG \n800 \nperformance status scores  < 2, 66% had elevated LDH levels, and 52% \n801 \nhad extranodal involvement in at least two sites.  Efficacy results are \n802 \npresented in Table 5. \n803 \nStudy 8 \n804 \n A total of 823 patients with DLBCL, aged 18\u221260 years, were \n805 \nrandomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive an anthracycline-containing \n806 \nchemotherapy regimen alone or in combination with Rituxan.  The main \n807 \noutcome measure of the study was time to treatment failure, defined as \n808 \ntime from randomization to the earliest of progressive disease, failure to \n809 \nachieve a complete response, relapse, or death.  Among all enrolled \n810 \npatients, 28% had Stage III\u2212IV disease, 100% had IPI scores of  \u2264 1, 99% \n811 \nhad ECOG performance status of  < 2, 29% had elevated LDH levels, 49% \n812 \nhad bulky disease, and 34% had extranodal involvement.

Patients were \u2265 18 years, \n822 \ndiagnosed with RA according to American College of Rheumatology \n823 \n(ACR) criteria, and had at least 8 swollen and 8 tender joints.  Patients \n824 \nreceived 2 doses of either Rituxan 1000 mg or placebo as an intravenous \n825 \ninfusion on days 1 and 15, in combination with continued methotrexate \n826 \n10\u221225 mg weekly. \n827 \n Efficacy was assessed at 24 weeks.  Glucocorticoids were given \n828 \nintravenously prior to each Rituxan infusion and orally on a tapering \n829 \nschedule from baseline through Day 16. \n830 \n The proportions of Rituxan (1000 mg) treated patients achieving \n831 \nACR 20, 50, and 70 responses in this study is shown in Table 6. \n832 \n \n833 \nPage 120\n \n \n \nTable 6 \nACR Responses at Week 24 in \nPlacebo-Controlled Study (Percent of Patients) \n(Modified Intent-to-Treat Population) \nResponse \nPlacebo + MTX \nn = 201 \nRituxan + MTX \nn = 298 \n51% \nACR 20 \n18% \np < 0.0001 \n27% \nACR 50 \n5% \np < 0.0001 \n12% \nACR 70 \n1% \np < 0.0001 \n \n834 \n Improvement was also noted for all components of ACR response \n835 \nfollowing treatment with Rituxan, as shown in Table 7. \n836 \nTable 7 \nComponents of ACR Response \n(Modified Intent-to-Treat Population) \nPlacebo + MTX \n(n = 201) \nRituxan + MTX \n(n = 298) \nParameter \n(median) \nBaseline \nWk 24 \nBaseline \nWk 24 \nTender Joint Count \n31.0 \n27.0 \n33.0 \n13.0* \nSwollen Joint Count \n20.0 \n19.0 \n21.0 \n9.5* \nPhysician Global Assessment a \n71.0 \n69.0 \n71.0 \n36.0* \nPatient Global Assessment a \n73.0 \n68.0 \n71.0 \n41.0* \nPaina \n68.0 \n68.0 \n67.0 \n38.5* \nDisability Index (HAQ) b \n2.0 \n1.9 \n1.9 \n1.5* \nCRP (mg/dL) \n2.4 \n2.5 \n2.6 \n0.9* \n a Visual Analogue Scale:  0 = best, 100 = worst. \n b Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire:  0 = best, 3 = worst. \n * p < 0.001, Rituxan + MTX vs. Placebo + MTX. \n \n837 \n The time course of ACR 20 response for this study is shown in \n838 \nFigure 1.

Do not use \n862 \nbeyond expiration date stamped on carton.  Rituxan vials should be \n863 \nprotected from direct sunlight.  Do not freeze or shake. \n864 \n Rituxan solutions for infusion may be stored at 2\u00b0C\u22128\u00b0C (36\u00b0F\u221246\u00b0F) \n865 \nfor 24 hours.  Rituxan solutions for infusion have been shown to be stable \n866 \nfor an additional 24 hours at room temperature.  However, since Rituxan \n867 \nsolutions do not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be stored \n868 \nrefrigerated (2\u00b0C\u22128\u00b0C).  No incompatibilities between Rituxan and \n869 \npolyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags have been observed. \n870 \n17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION \n871 \n See Medication Guide (17.2). \n872 \n17.1 \nGeneral Counseling Information \n873 \n Patients should be provided the Rituxan Medication Guide and provided \n874 \nan opportunity to read prior to each treatment session.  Because caution \n875 \nshould be exercised in administering Rituxan to patients with active \n876 \ninfections, it is important that the patient\u2019s overall health be assessed at \n877 \neach visit and any questions resulting from the patient\u2019s reading of the \n878 \nMedication Guide be discussed. \n879 \n Rituxan is detectable in serum for up to six months following \n880 \ncompletion of therapy.  Individuals of childbearing potential should use \n881 \neffective contraception during treatment and for 12 months after Rituxan \n882 \ntherapy. \n883 \nTable 8 \nMean Radiographic Change From Baseline to 56 Weeks \nParameter \nPlacebo + \nMTX \n(n=184) \nMean \nChange \nRituxan + \nMTX \n(n=273) \nMean \nChange \nTreatment \nDifference \n(Placebo - \nRituxan) \n95% CI for \nthe \nTreatment \nDifference \nSharp-Genant \nTotal Score \n2.31 \n1.00 \n1.31 \n(0.48, 2.14) \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Joint Space \nNarrowing \nScore \n0.99 \n0.41 \n0.58 \n(0.18, 0.98) \n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Erosion \nScore \n1.32 \n0.59 \n0.73 \n(0.22, 1.24) \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 123\n \n \n \n17.2 \nMedication Guide \n884 \nMEDICATION GUIDE \n885 \nRITUXAN\u00ae (ri-tuk\u00b4-san) \n886 \n(rituximab) \n887 \nRead the Medication Guide given to you before you start Rituxan and \n888 \nbefore each Rituxan infusion.

Talk with your doctor if you \n891 \nhave any questions about your treatment with Rituxan. \n892 \nWhat is the most important information I should know about \n893 \nRituxan? \n894 \nRituxan can cause serious side effects including: \n895 \n\u2022 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) \n896 \n\u2022 \nPML is a rare brain infection.  PML usually causes death or severe \n897 \ndisability. \n898 \n\u2022 \nCall your doctor right away if you notice any new or worsening \n899 \nmedical problems, such as a new or sudden change in thinking, \n900 \nwalking, strength, vision, or other problems that have lasted over \n901 \nseveral days. \n902 \n\u2022 \nPML usually happens in patients with weakened immune systems. \n903 \n\u2022 \nPML can occur during treatment with Rituxan or after treatment \n904 \nhas finished. \n905 \n\u2022 \nThere is no known treatment, prevention, or cure for PML. \n906 \n\u2022   \nInfusion reactions.  Tell your doctor or get medical treatment right \n907 \naway if you get hives, swelling, dizziness, blurred vision, drowsiness, \n908 \nheadache, cough, wheezing, or have trouble breathing while receiving \n909 \nor after receiving Rituxan. \n910 \n\u2022   \nTumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS).  TLS is caused by the fast \n911 \nbreakdown of certain types of cancer cells.  TLS can cause kidney \n912 \nfailure and the need for dialysis treatment.  Patients receiving Rituxan \n913 \nfor non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) may get TLS.  Your doctor will \n914 \ncheck you for TLS. \n915 \n\u2022   \nSevere skin reactions.  Tell your doctor or get medical treatment \n916 \nright away if you get any of these symptoms:  painful sores on your \n917 \nskin or in your mouth, ulcers, blisters, or peeling skin while receiving \n918 \nor after receiving Rituxan. \n919 \nSee \u201cWhat are possible side effects with Rituxan?\u201d for other serious \n920 \nside effects. \n921 \nWhat is Rituxan? \n922 \nRituxan is a prescription medicine used in adults: \n923 \n\u2022   \nalone or with other anti-cancer medicines to treat certain types of \n924 \nNHL. \n925 \n\u2022   \nwith another medicine called methotrexate to reduce the signs and \n926 \nsymptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) after at least one other \n927 \nmedicine called a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor has been used \n928 \nand did not work well. \n929 \nPage 124\n \n \n \nRituxan has not been studied in children. \n930 \nWhat should I tell my doctor before treatment with Rituxan? \n931 \nTell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: \n932 \n\u2022   \nhad a severe infusion reaction to Rituxan in the past. \n933 \n\u2022   \nhave an infection or have an infection that will not go away or that \n934 \nkeeps coming back. \n935 \n\u2022   \nhave or had hepatitis (liver) infection.  See \u201cWhat are the possible \n936 \nside effects of Rituxan?\u201d If so, your doctor should check you closely \n937 \nfor signs of hepatitis infection during treatment with Rituxan and for \n938 \nseveral months after treatment ends. \n939 \n\u2022   \nare scheduled to receive any vaccinations.  You should not receive \n940 \nlive vaccines after you receive Rituxan. \n941 \n\u2022   \nhave heart or lung problems. \n942 \n\u2022   \nare pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  It is not known if \n943 \nRituxan can harm your unborn baby. \n944 \n\u2022   \nare breastfeeding.  It is not known if Rituxan passes into human breast \n945 \nmilk.  You should not breastfeed while being treated with Rituxan and \n946 \nafter finishing treatment, until blood tests show that there is no \n947 \nRituxan in your blood. \n948 \nTell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription \n949 \nand nonprescription medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements.  If you \n950 \nhave RA, especially tell your doctor if you take or have taken another \n951 \nmedicine called a TNF inhibitor or a DMARD (disease modifying \n952 \nanti-rheumatic drug). \n953 \nHow do I receive Rituxan? \n954 \n\u2022   \nRituxan is given through a needle placed in a vein (IV or intravenous \n955 \ninfusion), in your arm.  Talk to your doctor about how you will \n956 \nreceive Rituxan. \n957 \n\u2022   \nYour doctor may prescribe medicines before each infusion of Rituxan \n958 \nto reduce side effects of infusions (such as fever and chills). \n959 \n\u2022   \nYour doctor should do regular blood tests to check for side effects to \n960 \nRituxan. \n961 \nBefore each Rituxan treatment, your doctor or nurse will ask you \n962 \nquestions about your general health to make sure that Rituxan is still right \n963 \nfor you.  Tell your doctor or nurse about any new symptoms, and \n964 \nsymptoms that get worse over a few days or that will not go away. \n965 \nPage 125\n \n \n \nWhat are the possible side effects of Rituxan? \n966 \nThe \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about \n967 \nRituxan?\u201d section lists certain serious and life-threatening side effects \n968 \nwith Rituxan.  Rituxan can cause other serious and life-threatening side \n969 \neffects including: \n970 \n\u2022   \nHepatitis B virus reactivation.  Tell your doctor if you had \n971 \nhepatitis B virus or are a carrier of hepatitis B virus.  Receiving \n972 \nRituxan could cause the hepatitis B virus to become an active \n973 \ninfection again.  This may cause serious liver problems and death.  \n974 \nPeople with active liver disease due to hepatitis B should stop \n975 \nreceiving Rituxan. \n976 \n\u2022   \nHeart problems.  Tell your doctor about any heart problems you \n977 \nhave including chest pain (angina) and irregular heart beats.  Rituxan \n978 \ncan cause chest pain and irregular heart beats which may require \n979 \ntreatment. \n980 \n\u2022   \nInfections.  Rituxan can increase your chances for getting infections.  \n981 \nCall your doctor right away if you have a cough that will not go away, \n982 \nfever, chills, congestion, or any flu-like symptoms while receiving \n983 \nRituxan.  These symptoms may be signs of a serious infection. \n984 \n\u2022   \nStomach and bowel problems.  Serious stomach and bowel \n985 \nproblems have been seen when Rituxan has been used with \n986 \nanti-cancer medicines in some patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s \n987 \nlymphoma.  Call your doctor right away if you have any stomach area \n988 \npain during treatment with Rituxan. \n989 \nCommon side effects during Rituxan infusions include: \n990 \n\u2022   fever \n\u2022 headache \n991 \n\u2022   chills and shakes \n\u2022 nausea \n992 \n\u2022   itching \n\u2022 hives \n993 \n\u2022 \ncough \n\u2022 sneezing \n994 \n\u2022 \nthroat irritation or tightness \n995 \n \n996 \nOther side effects with Rituxan include: \n997 \n\u2022   aching joints \n998 \n\u2022   upper respiratory tract infection \n999 \n\u2022   decreased blood cell counts \n1000 \n\u2022   lung problems \n1001 \n \n1002 \nTell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go \n1003 \naway.

(See DOSAGE\nAND ADMINISTRATION.) HIGH DOSE REGIMENS FOR OTHER NEOPLAS-\nTIC DISEASES ARE INVESTIGATIONAL AND A THERAPEUTIC ADVAN-\nTAGE HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.\nMETHOTREXATE FORMULATIONS AND DILUENTS CONTAINING\nPRESERVATIVES MUST NOT BE USED FOR INTRATHECAL OR HIGH\nDOSE METHOTREXATE THERAPY.\n1. Methotrexate has been reported to cause fetal death and/or congenital\nanomalies. Therefore, it is not recommended for women of childbearing poten-\ntial unless there is clear medical evidence that the benefits can be expected to\noutweigh the considered risks. Pregnant women with psoriasis or rheumatoid\narthritis should not receive methotrexate (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).\n2. Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal\nfunction, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially\ncareful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some\ncases, discontinuation of methotrexate administration.\n3. Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression,\naplastic anemia, and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with con-\ncomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along\nwith some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See PRE-\nCAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.)\n4. Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally\nonly after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently\nseen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear\npredictive of subsequent hepatic disease. Liver biopsy after sustained use\noften shows histologic changes, and fibrosis and cirrhosis have been report-\ned; these latter lesions may not be preceded by symptoms or abnormal liver\nfunction tests in the psoriasis population. For this reason, periodic liver biop-\nsies are usually recommended for psoriatic patients who are under long-term\ntreatment. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede\nappearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population.\n(See PRECAUTIONS, Organ System Toxicity, Hepatic.)\n5. Methotrexate-induced lung disease, including acute or chronic intersti-\ntial pneumonitis, is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur\nacutely at any time during therapy and has been reported at low doses. It\nis not always fully reversible and fatalities have been reported. Pulmonary\nsymptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interrup-\ntion of treatment and careful investigation.\n6. Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy; other-\nwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur.\n7. Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of\nmethotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and,\nthus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue methotrexate first and,\nif the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted.\n8. Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce \u201ctumor lysis syn-\ndrome\u201d in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Appropriate supportive\nand pharmacologic measures may prevent or alleviate this complication.\n9. Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following\nsingle or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within\ndays of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate\nadministration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of ther-\napy. (See PRECAUTIONS, Organ System Toxicity, Skin.)\n10. Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis\ncarinii pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy.\n11. Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the\nrisk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis.\nDESCRIPTION\nMethotrexate is an antimetabolite used in the treatment of certain neoplastic dis-\neases, severe psoriasis, and adult rheumatoid arthritis. Chemically methotrexate is\nL-(+)-N-[p-[[(2,4-Diamino-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]-benzoyl]glutamic\nacid. The structural formula is:\nC20H22N8O5\nM.W.=454.44\nMethotrexate for injection and Methotrexate injection (Preservative Free) products\nare sterile and non-pyrogenic and may be given by the intramuscular, intravenous,\nintra-arterial or intrathecal route. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)\nMethotrexate Injection, USP, isotonic liquid, preservative free, for single use only,\nis available in 25 mg/mL, 2 mL (50 mg), 4 mL (100 mg), 8 mL (200 mg), and \n10 mL (250 mg) vials.\nEach 25 mg/mL, 2 mL, 4 mL, 8 mL, and 10 mL vial contains methotrexate sodium\nequivalent to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 250 mg methotrexate respectively, and\nthe following inactive ingredients: sodium chloride 0.490% w/v and water for injec-\ntion qs ad 100% v. Sodium hydroxide and, if necessary, hydrochloric acid are\nadded to adjust the pH to approximately 8.5. The 2 mL, 4 mL, 8 mL, and 10 mL\nsolutions contain approximately 0.43 mEq, 0.86 mEq, 1.72 mEq, and 2.15 mEq of\nsodium per vial, respectively, and are isotonic solutions. \nMethotrexate for Injection, USP, lyophilized, preservative free, for single use only,\nis available in 1 gram vials.\nEach 1 gram vial of lyophilized powder contains methotrexate sodium equivalent\nto 1 gram methotrexate. Contains no preservative. Sodium hydroxide and, if nec-\nessary, hydrochloric acid are added during manufacture to adjust the pH. The \n1 gram vial contains approximately 7 mEq sodium.\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nMethotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced\nto tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-\ncarbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore,\nmethotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication.\nActively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells,\nbuccal and intestinal mucosa and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more\nsensitive to this effect of methotrexate. When cellular proliferation in malignant tis-\nsues is greater than in most normal tissues, methotrexate may impair malignant\ngrowth without irreversible damage to normal tissues.\nThe mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown; it may affect immune\nfunction. Two reports describe in vitro methotrexate inhibition of DNA precursor\nuptake by stimulated mononuclear cells, and another describes in animal pol-\nyarthritis partial correction by methotrexate of spleen cell hyporesponsiveness and\nsuppressed IL 2 production. Other laboratories, however, have been unable to\ndemonstrate similar effects. Clarification of methotrexate\u2019s effect on immune activ-\nity and its relation to rheumatoid immunopathogenesis await further studies. \nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis, effects of methotrexate on articular swelling\nand tenderness can be seen as early as 3 to 6 weeks. Although methotrexate clear-\nly ameliorates symptoms of inflammation (pain, swelling, stiffness), there is no evi-\ndence that it induces remission of rheumatoid arthritis nor has a beneficial effect\nbeen demonstrated on bone erosions and other radiologic changes which result in\nimpaired joint use, functional disability, and deformity. \nMost studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are relatively short\nterm (3 to 6 months). Limited data from long-term studies indicate that an initial clin-\nical improvement is maintained for at least two years with continued therapy. \nIn psoriasis, the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin is greatly increased\nover normal skin. This differential in proliferation rates is the basis for the use of\nmethotrexate to control the psoriatic process.\nMethotrexate in high doses, followed by leucovorin rescue, is used as a part of the\ntreatment of patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma. The original rationale for\nhigh dose methotrexate therapy was based on the concept of selective rescue of nor-\nmal tissues by leucovorin. More recent evidence suggests that high dose methotrex-\nate may also overcome methotrexate resistance caused by impaired active transport,\ndecreased affinity of dihydrofolic acid reductase for methotrexate, increased levels of\ndihydrofolic acid reductase resulting from gene amplification, or decreased polyglu-\ntamation of methotrexate. The actual mechanism of action is unknown.\nIn a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 127 pediatric patients with juve-\nnile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) (mean age, 10.1 years; age range, 2.5 to 18 years; mean\nduration of disease, 5.1 years) on background nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAIDs) and/or prednisone, methotrexate given weekly at an oral dose of 10 mg/m2\nprovided significant clinical improvement compared to placebo as measured by either\nthe physician\u2019s global assessment, or by a patient composite (25% reduction in the\narticular-severity score plus improvement in parent and physician global assessments\nof disease activity). Over two-thirds of the patients in this trial had polyarticular-course\nJRA, and the numerically greatest response was seen in this subgroup treated with \n10 mg/m2/wk methotrexate. The overwhelming majority of the remaining patients had\nsystemic-course JRA. All patients were unresponsive to NSAIDs; approximately one-\nthird were using low dose corticosteroids. Weekly methotrexate at a dose of 5 mg/m2\nwas not significantly more effective than placebo in this trial. \nTwo Pediatric Oncology Group studies (one randomized and one non-randomized)\ndemonstrated a significant improvement in relapse-free survival in patients with\nnon-metastatic osteosarcoma, when high dose methotrexate with leucovorin res-\ncue was used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents following surgi-\ncal resection of the primary tumor. These studies were not designed to demon-\nstrate the specific contribution of high dose methotrexate/leucovorin rescue ther-\napy to the efficacy of the combination. However, a contribution can be inferred\nfrom the reports of objective responses to this therapy in patients with metastatic\nosteosarcoma, and from reports of extensive tumor necrosis following preopera-\ntive administration of this therapy to patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma.\nPharmacokinetics\nAbsorption - In adults, oral absorption appears to be dose dependent. Peak serum\nlevels are reached within one to two hours. At doses of 30 mg/m2 or less,\nmethotrexate is generally well absorbed with a mean bioavailability of about 60%.\nThe absorption of doses greater than 80 mg/m2 is significantly less, possibly due\nto a saturation effect.\nIn leukemic pediatric patients, oral absorption of methotrexate also appears to be\ndose dependent and has been reported to vary widely (23% to 95%). A twenty-fold\ndifference between highest and lowest peak levels (Cmax: 0.11 to 2.3 micromolar\nafter a 20 mg/m2 dose) has been reported. Significant interindividual variability has\nalso been noted in time to peak concentration (Tmax: 0.67 to 4 hrs after a 15 mg/m2\ndose) and fraction of dose absorbed. The absorption of doses greater than \n40 mg/m2 has been reported to be significantly less than that of lower doses. Food\nhas been shown to delay absorption and reduce peak concentration. Methotrexate\nis generally completely absorbed from parenteral routes of injection. After intra-\nmuscular injection, peak serum concentrations occur in 30 to 60 minutes. As in\nleukemic pediatric patients, a wide interindividual variability in the plasma concen-\ntrations of methotrexate has been reported in pediatric patients with JRA.\nFollowing oral administration of methotrexate in doses of 6.4 to 11.2 mg/m2/week\nin pediatric patients with JRA, mean serum concentrations were 0.59 micromolar\n(range, 0.03 to 1.40) at 1 hour, 0.44 micromolar (range, 0.01 to 1.00) at \n2 hours, and 0.29 micromolar (range, 0.06 to 0.58) at 3 hours. In pediatric patients\nreceiving methotrexate for acute lymphocytic leukemia (6.3 to 30 mg/m2), or for\nJRA (3.75 to 26.2 mg/m2), the terminal half-life has been reported to range from\n0.7 to 5.8 hours or 0.9 to 2.3 hours, respectively.\nDistribution - After intravenous administration, the initial volume of distribution is\napproximately 0.18 L/kg (18% of body weight) and steady-state volume of distribution\nis approximately 0.4 to 0.8 L/kg (40 to 80% of body weight). Methotrexate competes\nwith reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes by means of a single\ncarrier-mediated active transport process. At serum concentrations greater than \n100 micromolar, passive diffusion becomes a major pathway by which effective intra-\ncellular concentrations can be achieved. Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50%\nprotein bound. Laboratory studies demonstrate that it may be displaced from plasma\nalbumin by various compounds including sulfonamides, salicylates, tetracyclines, chlo-\nramphenicol, and phenytoin.\nMethotrexate does not penetrate the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeu-\ntic amounts when given orally or parenterally. High CSF concentrations of the drug\nmay be attained by intrathecal administration.\nIn dogs, synovial fluid concentrations after oral dosing were higher in inflamed\nthan uninflamed joints. Although salicylates did not interfere with this penetration,\nprior prednisone treatment reduced penetration into inflamed joints to the level of\nnormal joints. \nMetabolism - After absorption, methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular\nmetabolism to polyglutamated forms which can be converted back to methotrex-\nate by hydrolase enzymes. These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate\nreductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of methotrexate polygluta-\nmates may remain in tissues for extended periods. The retention and prolonged\ndrug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues and\ntumors. A small amount of metabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate may occur at\ndoses commonly prescribed. Accumulation of this metabolite may become signif-\nicant at the high doses used in osteogenic sarcoma. The aqueous solubility of \n7-hydroxymethotrexate is 3 to 5 fold lower than the parent compound.\nMethotrexate is partially metabolized by intestinal flora after oral administration.\nHalf-Life - The terminal half-life reported for methotrexate is approximately 3 to \n10 hours for patients receiving treatment for psoriasis, or rheumatoid arthritis or\nlow-dose antineoplastic therapy (less than 30 mg/m2). For patients receiving high\ndoses of methotrexate, the terminal half-life is 8 to 15 hours.\nExcretion - Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent\nupon dosage and route of administration. With IV administration, 80 to 90% of the\nadministered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. There is\nlimited biliary excretion amounting to 10% or less of the administered dose.\nEnterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed.\nRenal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Nonlinear\nelimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psori-\natic patients at doses between 7.5 and 30 mg. Impaired renal function, as well as con-\ncurrent use of drugs such as weak organic acids that also undergo tubular secretion,\ncan markedly increase methotrexate serum levels. Excellent correlation has been report-\ned between methotrexate clearance and endogenous clearance.\nMethotrexate clearance rates vary widely and are generally decreased at higher\ndoses. Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the major factors\nresponsible for methotrexate toxicity. It has been postulated that the toxicity of\nmethotrexate for normal tissues is more dependent upon the duration of exposure to\nthe drug rather than the peak level achieved. When a patient has delayed drug elim-\nination due to compromised renal function, a third space effusion, or other causes,\nmethotrexate serum concentrations may remain elevated for prolonged periods.\nThe potential for toxicity from high dose regimens or delayed excretion is reduced\nby the administration of leucovorin calcium during the final phase of methotrexate\nplasma elimination. Pharmacokinetic monitoring of methotrexate serum concen-\ntrations may help identify those patients at high risk for methotrexate toxicity and\naid in proper adjustment of leucovorin dosing. Guidelines for monitoring serum\nmethotrexate levels, and for adjustment of leucovorin dosing to reduce the risk of\nmethotrexate toxicity, are provided below in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.\nMethotrexate has been detected in human breast milk. The highest breast milk to\nplasma concentration ratio reached was 0.08:1.\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE\nNeoplastic Diseases: Methotrexate is indicated in the treatment of gestational\nchoriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens and hydatidiform mole.\nIn acute lymphocytic leukemia, methotrexate is indicated in the prophylaxis of\nmeningeal leukemia and is used in maintenance therapy in combination with other\nchemotherapeutic agents. Methotrexate is also indicated in the treatment of\nmeningeal leukemia.\nMethotrexate is used alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in the treat-\nment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, advanced mycosis\nfungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell\nand small cell types. Methotrexate is also used in combination with other chemother-\napeutic agents in the treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas.\nH2N\nNH2\nCH3\nHOOCCH2CH2\nCH2N\nCONH\nCOOH\nH\nC\nN\nN\nN\nN\nMethotrexate in high doses followed by leucovorin rescue in combination with\nother chemotherapeutic agents is effective in prolonging relapse-free survival in\npatients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma who have undergone surgical resec-\ntion or amputation for the primary tumor.\nPsoriasis: Methotrexate is indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalci-\ntrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of ther-\napy, but only when the diagnosis has been established, as by a biopsy and/or after\ndermatologic consultation. It is important to ensure that a psoriasis \u201cflare\u201d is not\ndue to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses.\nRheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid\nArthritis: Methotrexate is indicated in the management of selected adults with\nsevere, active rheumatoid arthritis (ACR criteria), or children with active polyartic-\nular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic\nresponse to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full\ndose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). \nAspirin, NSAIDs, and/or low dose steroids may be continued, although the possi-\nbility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates\nhas not been fully explored. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.) Steroids\nmay be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate. Combined use\nof methotrexate with gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or\ncytotoxic agents, has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse\neffects. Rest and physiotherapy as indicated should be continued. \nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nMethotrexate can cause fetal death or teratogenic effects when administered to a\npregnant woman. Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnant women with psori-\nasis or rheumatoid arthritis and should be used in the treatment of neoplastic dis-\neases only when the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Women of\nchildbearing potential should not be started on methotrexate until pregnancy is\nexcluded and should be fully counseled on the serious risk to the fetus (see PRE-\nCAUTIONS) should they become pregnant while undergoing treatment. Pregnancy\nshould be avoided if either partner is receiving methotrexate; during and for a min-\nimum of 3 months after therapy for male patients, and during and for at least one\novulatory cycle after therapy for female patients (see Boxed WARNINGS).\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions from methotrexate in breast\nfed infants, it is contraindicated in nursing mothers.\nPatients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis with alcoholism, alcoholic liver dis-\nease or other chronic liver disease should not receive methotrexate.\nPatients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis who have overt or laboratory evi-\ndence of immunodeficiency syndromes should not receive methotrexate.\nPatients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis who have preexisting blood\ndyscrasias, such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or\nsignificant anemia, should not receive methotrexate.\nPatients with known hypersensitivity to methotrexate should not receive the drug.\nWARNINGS\nSee Boxed WARNINGS.\nMethotrexate formulations and diluents containing preservatives must not be used\nfor intrathecal or high dose methotrexate therapy. \nPRECAUTIONS\nGeneral: Methotrexate has the potential for serious toxicity (see Boxed WARN-\nINGS). Toxic effects may be related in frequency and severity to dose or frequen-\ncy of administration but have been seen at all doses. Because they can occur at\nany time during therapy, it is necessary to follow patients on methotrexate close-\nly. Most adverse reactions are reversible if detected early. When such reactions do\noccur, the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate cor-\nrective measures should be taken. If necessary, this could include the use of leu-\ncovorin calcium and/or acute, intermittent hemodialysis with a high-flux dialyzer.\n(See OVERDOSAGE.) If methotrexate therapy is reinstituted, it should be carried\nout with caution, with adequate consideration of further need for the drug and\nincreased alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity.\nThe clinical pharmacology of methotrexate has not been well studied in older indi-\nviduals. Due to diminished hepatic and renal function as well as decreased folate\nstores in this population, relatively low doses should be considered, and these\npatients should be closely monitored for early signs of toxicity.\nSome of the effects mentioned under ADVERSE REACTIONS, such as dizziness\nand fatigue, may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery. \nInformation for Patients: Patients should be informed of the early signs and symp-\ntoms of toxicity, of the need to see their physician promptly if they occur, and the\nneed for close follow-up, including periodic laboratory tests to monitor toxicity.\nBoth the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that the rec-\nommended dose is taken weekly in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and that\nmistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity. Prescriptions\nshould not be written or refilled on a PRN basis. \nPatients should be informed of the potential benefit and risk in the use of\nmethotrexate. The risk of effects on reproduction should be discussed with both\nmale and female patients taking methotrexate.\nLaboratory Tests: Patients undergoing methotrexate therapy should be closely\nmonitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly. Baseline assessment should\ninclude complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, hepatic enzymes,\nrenal function tests, and a chest X-ray. During therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and\npsoriasis, monitoring of these parameters is recommended: hematology at least\nmonthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months. More frequent mon-\nitoring is usually indicated during antineoplastic therapy. During initial or changing\ndoses, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels\n(e.g., dehydration), more frequent monitoring may also be indicated.\nTransient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrex-\nate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate ther-\napy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albu-\nmin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation. (See PRE-\nCAUTIONS, Organ System Toxicity, Hepatic.)\nA relationship between abnormal liver function tests and fibrosis or cirrhosis of the\nliver has not been established for patients with psoriasis. Persistent abnormalities\nin liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the\nrheumatoid arthritis population.\nPulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is\nsuspected, especially if baseline measurements are available.\nDrug Interactions: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be adminis-\ntered prior to or concomitantly with the high doses of methotrexate, such as used\nin the treatment of osteosarcoma. Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs\nwith high dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong\nserum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gas-\ntrointestinal toxicity.\nCaution should be used when NSAIDs or salicylates are administered concomitant-\nly with lower doses of methotrexate. These drugs have been reported to reduce the\ntubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model and may enhance its toxicity.\nDespite the potential interactions, studies of methotrexate in patients with rheuma-\ntoid arthritis have usually included concurrent use of constant dosage regimens of\nNSAIDs, without apparent problems. It should be appreciated, however, that the\ndoses used in rheumatoid arthritis (7.5 to 15 mg/week) are somewhat lower than\nthose used in psoriasis and that larger doses could lead to unexpected toxicity. \nMethotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin, and toxicity may be increased\nbecause of displacement by certain drugs, such as salicylates, phenylbutazone,\nphenytoin, and sulfonamides. Renal tubular transport is also diminished by\nprobenecid; use of methotrexate with this drug should be carefully monitored.\nIn the treatment of patients with osteosarcoma, caution must be exercised if high-\ndose methotrexate is administered in combination with a potentially nephrotoxic\nchemotherapeutic agent (e.g., cisplatin).\nMethotrexate increases the plasma levels of mercaptopurine. The combination of\nmethotrexate and mercaptopurine may therefore require dose adjustment. \nOral antibiotics such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and nonabsorbable broad\nspectrum antibiotics, may decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or inter-\nfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora and suppressing\nmetabolism of the drug by bacteria.\nPenicillins may reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate; increased serum con-\ncentrations of methotrexate with concomitant hematologic and gastrointestinal\ntoxicity have been observed with high and low dose methotrexate. Use of\nmethotrexate with penicillins should be carefully monitored.\nThe potential for increased hepatotoxicity when methotrexate is administered with\nother hepatotoxic agents has not been evaluated. However, hepatotoxicity has been\nreported in such cases. Therefore, patients receiving concomitant therapy with\nmethotrexate and other potential hepatotoxins (e.g., azathioprine, retinoids, sul-\nfasalazine) should be closely monitored for possible increased risk of hepatotoxicity.\nMethotrexate may decrease the clearance of theophylline; theophylline levels\nshould be monitored when used concurrently with methotrexate.\nVitamin preparations containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease respons-\nes to systemically administered methotrexate. Preliminary animal and human\nstudies have shown that small quantities of intravenously administered leucovorin\nenter the CSF primarily as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and, in humans, remain 1 to \n3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual methotrexate concentrations following\nintrathecal administration. However, high doses of leucovorin may reduce the effi-\ncacy of intrathecally administered methotrexate.\nFolate deficiency states may increase methotrexate toxicity. Trimethoprim/sul-\nfamethoxazole has been reported rarely to increase bone marrow suppression in\npatients receiving methotrexate, probably by decreased tubular secretion and/or\nadditive antifolate effect.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No controlled human data\nexist regarding the risk of neoplasia with methotrexate. Methotrexate has been eval-\nuated in a number of animal studies for carcinogenic potential with inconclusive\nresults. Although there is evidence that methotrexate causes chromosomal damage\nto animal somatic cells and human bone marrow cells, the clinical significance\nremains uncertain. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other tumors have been report-\ned in patients receiving low-dose oral methotrexate. However, there have been\ninstances of malignant lymphoma arising during treatment with low-dose oral\nmethotrexate, which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrex-\nate, without requiring active anti-lymphoma treatment. Benefits should be weighed\nagainst the potential risks before using methotrexate alone or in combination with\nother drugs, especially in pediatric patients or young adults. Methotrexate causes\nembryotoxicity, abortion, and fetal defects in humans. It has also been reported to\ncause impairment of fertility, oligospermia and menstrual dysfunction in humans,\nduring and for a short period after cessation of therapy.\nPregnancy, Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category X: Psoriasis and rheumatoid\narthritis: Methotrexate is in Pregnancy Category X (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).\nNursing Mothers: See CONTRAINDICATIONS.\nPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have been established only in\ncancer chemotherapy and in polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. \nPublished clinical studies evaluating the use of methotrexate in children and adoles-\ncents (i.e., patients 2 to 16 years of age) with JRA demonstrated safety comparable to\nthat observed in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,\nADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)\nMethotrexate injectable formulations containing the preservative benzyl alcohol\nare not recommended for use in neonates. There have been reports of fatal \u201cgasp-\ning syndrome\u201d in neonates (children less than one month of age) following the\nadministration of intravenous solutions containing the preservative benzyl alcohol.\nSymptoms include a striking onset of gasping respiration, hypotension, bradycar-\ndia, and cardiovascular collapse. \nSerious neurotoxicity, frequently manifested as generalized or focal seizures, has\nbeen reported with unexpectedly increased frequency among pediatric patients with\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated with intermediate-dose intravenous\nmethotrexate (1 gm/m2). (See PRECAUTIONS, Organ System Toxicity, Neurologic.)\nGeriatric Use: Clinical studies of methotrexate did not include sufficient numbers\nof subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from\nyounger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cau-\ntious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and renal function,\ndecreased folate stores, concomitant disease or other drug therapy (i.e., that inter-\nfere with renal function, methotrexate or folate metabolism) in this population (see\nPRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Since decline in renal function may be asso-\nciated with increases in adverse events and serum creatinine measurements may\nover estimate renal function in the elderly, more accurate methods (i.e., creatinine\nclearance) should be considered. Serum methotrexate levels may also be helpful.\nElderly patients should be closely monitored for early signs of hepatic, bone mar-\nrow and renal toxicity. In chronic use situations, certain toxicities may be reduced\nby folate supplementation. Post-marketing experience suggests that the occur-\nrence of bone marrow suppression, thrombocytopenia, and pneumonitis may\nincrease with age. See Boxed WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS.\nOrgan System Toxicity: Gastrointestinal - If vomiting, diarrhea, or stomatitis\noccur, which may result in dehydration, methotrexate should be discontinued until\nrecovery occurs. Methotrexate should be used with extreme caution in the pres-\nence of peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis.\nHematologic - Methotrexate can suppress hematopoiesis and cause anemia, aplastic\nanemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. In patients\nwith malignancy and preexisting hematopoietic impairment, the drug should be used\nwith caution, if at all. In controlled clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis (n=128),\nleukopenia (WBC <3000/mm3) was seen in 2 patients, thrombocytopenia (platelets\n<100,000/mm3) in 6 patients, and pancytopenia in 2 patients.\nIn psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate should be stopped immediate-\nly if there is a significant drop in blood counts. In the treatment of neoplastic dis-\neases, methotrexate should be continued only if the potential benefit warrants the\nrisk of severe myelosuppression. Patients with profound granulocytopenia and\nfever should be evaluated immediately and usually require parenteral broad-spec-\ntrum antibiotic therapy.\nHepatic - Methotrexate has the potential for acute (elevated transaminases) and\nchronic (fibrosis and cirrhosis) hepatotoxicity. Chronic toxicity is potentially fatal;\nit generally has occurred after prolonged use (generally two years or more) and\nafter a total dose of at least 1.5 grams. In studies in psoriatic patients, hepatotox-\nicity appeared to be a function of total cumulative dose and appeared to be\nenhanced by alcoholism, obesity, diabetes, and advanced age. An accurate inci-\ndence rate has not been determined; the rate of progression and reversibility of\nlesions is not known. Special caution is indicated in the presence of preexisting\nliver damage or impaired hepatic function.\nIn psoriasis, liver function tests, including serum albumin, should be performed\nperiodically prior to dosing but are often normal in the face of developing fibrosis\nor cirrhosis. These lesions may be detectable only by biopsy. The usual recom-\nmendation is to obtain a liver biopsy at 1) pretherapy or shortly after initiation of\ntherapy (2 to 4 months), 2) a total cumulative dose of 1.5 grams, and 3) after each\nadditional 1 to 1.5 grams. Moderate fibrosis or any cirrhosis normally leads to dis-\ncontinuation of the drug; mild fibrosis normally suggests a repeat biopsy in \n6 months. Milder histologic findings such as fatty change and low grade portal\ninflammation are relatively common pretherapy. Although these mild changes are\nusually not a reason to avoid or discontinue methotrexate therapy, the drug should\nbe used with caution.\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, age at first use of methotrexate and duration of therapy have\nbeen reported as risk factors for hepatotoxicity; other risk factors, similar to those\nobserved in psoriasis, may be present in rheumatoid arthritis but have not been\nconfirmed to date. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede\nappearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in this population. There is a combined reported\nexperience in 217 rheumatoid arthritis patients with liver biopsies both before and\nduring treatment (after a cumulative dose of at least 1.5 g) and in 714 patients with\na biopsy only during treatment. There are 64 (7%) cases of fibrosis and 1 (0.1%)\ncase of cirrhosis. Of the 64 cases of fibrosis, 60 were deemed mild. The reticulin\nstain is more sensitive for early fibrosis and its use may increase these figures. It\nis unknown whether even longer use will increase these risks.\nLiver function tests should be performed at baseline and at 4 to 8 week intervals\nin patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. Pretreatment liver biop-\nsy should be performed for patients with a history of excessive alcohol consump-\ntion, persistently abnormal baseline liver function test values or chronic hepatitis\nB or C infection. During therapy, liver biopsy should be performed if there are per-\nsistent liver function test abnormalities or there is a decrease in serum albumin\nbelow the normal range (in the setting of well controlled rheumatoid arthritis).\nIf the results of a liver biopsy show mild changes (Roenigk grades I, II, IIIa),\nmethotrexate may be continued and the patient monitored as per recommendations\nlisted above. Methotrexate should be discontinued in any patient who displays per-\nsistently abnormal liver function tests and refuses liver biopsy or in any patient\nwhose liver biopsy shows moderate to severe changes (Roenigk grade IIIb, or IV).\nInfection or Immunologic States - Methotrexate should be used with extreme cau-\ntion in the presence of active infection, and is usually contraindicated in patients\nwith overt or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency syndromes. Immunization\nmay be ineffective when given during methotrexate therapy. Immunization with live\nvirus vaccines is generally not recommended. There have been reports of dissem-\ninated vaccinia infections after smallpox immunizations in patients receiving\nmethotrexate therapy. Hypogammaglobulinemia has been reported rarely.\nPotentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia\nmay occur with methotrexate therapy. When a patient presents with pulmonary\nsymptoms, the possibility of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be considered.\nNeurologic - There have been reports of leukoencephalopathy following intra-\nvenous administration of methotrexate to patients who have had craniospinal irra-\ndiation. Serious neurotoxicity, frequently manifested as generalized or focal\nseizures, has been reported with unexpectedly increased frequency among pedi-\natric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated with intermedi-\nate-dose intravenous methotrexate (1 gm/m2). Symptomatic patients were com-\nmonly noted to have leukoencephalopathy and/or microangiopathic calcifications\non diagnostic imaging studies. Chronic leukoencephalopathy has also been report-\ned in patients who received repeated doses of high-dose methotrexate with leu-\ncovorin rescue even without cranial irradiation. Discontinuation of methotrexate\ndoes not always result in complete recovery.\nA transient acute neurologic syndrome has been observed in patients treated with\nhigh dosage regimens. Manifestations of this stroke-like encephalopathy may\ninclude confusion, hemiparesis, transient blindness, seizures and coma. The exact\ncause is unknown.\nPage 129\n \nDrug*\nDose*\nTreatment Week \nAfter Surgery\nMethotrexate\n12 g/m2 IV as 4 hour \n4,5,6,7,11,12,15,\ninfusion (starting dose)\n16,29,30,44,45\nLeucovorin\n15 mg orally every six hours \nfor 10 doses starting at 24 hours after \nstart of methotrexate infusion.\nDoxorubicin\u2020 as a single drug 30 mg/m2/day IV x 3 days\n8,17\nDoxorubicin\u2020\n50 mg/m2 IV\n20,23,33,36\nCisplatin\u2020\n100 mg/m2 IV\n20,23,33,36\nBleomycin\u2020\n15 units/m2 IV x 2 days\n2,13,26,39,42\nCyclophosphamide\u2020\n600 mg/m2 IV x 2 days\n2,13,26,39,42\nDactinomycin\u2020\n0.6 mg/m2 IV x 2 days\n2,13,26,39,42\n*Link MP, Goorin AM, Miser AW, et al; The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on\nrelapse-free survival in patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity.

Dosage mod-\nifications may be necessary because of drug-induced toxicity.\nWhen these higher doses of methotrexate are to be administered, the following\nsafety guidelines should be closely observed.\nGUIDELINES FOR METHOTREXATE THERAPY WITH LEUCOVORIN RESCUE\n1.\nAdministration of methotrexate should be delayed until recovery if:\n\u2022 the WBC count is less than 1500/microliter\n\u2022 the neutrophil count is less than 200/microliter\n\u2022 the platelet count is less than 75,000/microliter\n\u2022 the serum bilirubin level is greater than 1.2 mg/dL\n\u2022 the SGPT level is greater than 450 U\n\u2022 mucositis is present, until there is evidence of healing\n\u2022 persistent pleural effusion is present; this should be drained dry prior to infusion.\n2.\nAdequate renal function must be documented.\na. Serum creatinine must be normal, and creatinine clearance must be greater\nthan 60 mL/min, before initiation of therapy.\nb. Serum creatinine must be measured prior to each subsequent course of ther-\napy. If serum creatinine has increased by 50% or more compared to a prior value,\nthe creatinine clearance must be measured and documented to be greater than\n60 mL/min (even if the serum creatinine is still within the normal range).\n3.\nPatients must be well hydrated, and must be treated with sodium bicarbonate\nfor urinary alkalinization.\na. Administer 1,000 mL/m2 of intravenous fluid over 6 hours prior to initia-\ntion of the methotrexate infusion. Continue hydration at 125 mL/m2/hr\n(3 liters/m2/day) during the methotrexate infusion, and for 2 days after the\ninfusion has been completed.\nb. Alkalinize urine to maintain pH above 7.0 during methotrexate infusion and leu-\ncovorin calcium therapy. This can be accomplished by the administration of sodi-\num bicarbonate orally or by incorporation into a separate intravenous solution.\n4.\nRepeat serum creatinine and serum methotrexate 24 hours after starting\nmethotrexate and at least once daily until the methotrexate level is below \n5x10-8 mol/L (0.05 micromolar).\n5.\nThe table below provides guidelines for leucovorin calcium dosage based upon\nserum methotrexate levels. (See table below.\u2021)\nPatients who experience delayed early methotrexate elimination are likely to devel-\nop nonreversible oliguric renal failure. In addition to appropriate leucovorin thera-\npy, these patients require continuing hydration and urinary alkalinization, and close\nmonitoring of fluid and electrolyte status, until the serum methotrexate level has\nfallen to below 0.05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved. If necessary,\nacute, intermittent hemodialysis with a high-flux dialyzer may also be beneficial in\nthese patients.\n6.\nSome patients will have abnormalities in methotrexate elimination, or abnor-\nmalities in renal function following methotrexate administration, which are sig-\nnificant but less severe than the abnormalities described in the table below.\nThese abnormalities may or may not be associated with significant clinical toxi-\ncity. If significant clinical toxicity is observed, leucovorin rescue should be\nextended for an additional 24 hours (total 14 doses over 84 hours) in subse-\nquent courses of therapy. The possibility that the patient is taking other medica-\ntions which interact with methotrexate (e.g., medications which may interfere\nwith methotrexate binding to serum albumin, or elimination) should always be\nreconsidered when laboratory abnormalities or clinical toxicities are observed.\nCAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER LEUCOVORIN INTRATHECALLY.\nPsoriasis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis \nAdult Rheumatoid Arthritis: Recommended Starting Dosage Schedules\n1.\nSingle oral doses of 7.5 mg once weekly.\u2020\n2.\nDivided oral dosages of 2.5 mg at 12 hour intervals for 3 doses given as a\ncourse once weekly.\u2020\n\u2020Methotrexate Sodium Tablets for oral administration are available.\nPolyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis: The recommended starting\ndose is 10 mg/m2 given once weekly.\nFor either adult RA or polyarticular-course JRA dosages may be adjusted gradually\nto achieve an optimal response. Limited experience shows a significant increase in\nthe incidence and severity of serious toxic reactions, especially bone marrow sup-\npression, at doses greater than 20 mg/wk in adults. Although there is experience\nwith doses up to 30 mg/m2/wk in children, there are too few published data to\nassess how doses over 20 mg/m2/wk might affect the risk of serious toxicity in chil-\ndren. Experience does suggest, however, that children receiving 20 to 30 mg/m2/wk\n(0.65 to 1 mg/kg/wk) may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side\neffects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.\nTherapeutic response usually begins within 3 to 6 weeks and the patient may con-\ntinue to improve for another 12 weeks or more.\nThe optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Limited data available from long-term\nstudies in adults indicate that the initial clinical improvement is maintained for at\nleast two years with continued therapy. When methotrexate is discontinued, the\narthritis usually worsens within 3 to 6 weeks.\nThe patient should be fully informed of the risks involved and should be under con-\nstant supervision of the physician. (See Information for Patients under PRECAU-\nTIONS.) Assessment of hematologic, hepatic, renal, and pulmonary function\nshould be made by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests before\nbeginning, periodically during, and before reinstituting methotrexate therapy (see\nPRECAUTIONS). Appropriate steps should be taken to avoid conception during\nmethotrexate therapy (see PRECAUTIONS and CONTRAINDICATIONS).\nAll schedules should be continually tailored to the individual patient. An initial test\ndose may be given prior to the regular dosing schedule to detect any extreme sen-\nsitivity to adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Maximal myelosuppression\nusually occurs in 7 to 10 days.\nPsoriasis: Recommended Starting Dose Schedules\n1.\nWeekly single oral, IM or IV dosage schedule: 10 to 25 mg per week until ade-\nquate response is achieved.\u2020\n2.\nDivided oral dosage schedule: 2.5 mg at 12 hour intervals for three doses.\u2020\n\u2020Methotrexate Sodium Tablets for oral administration are available.\nDosages in each schedule may be gradually adjusted to achieve optimal clinical\nresponse; 30 mg/week should not ordinarily be exceeded.\nOnce optimal clinical response has been achieved, each dosage schedule should\nbe reduced to the lowest possible amount of drug and to the longest possible rest\nperiod. The use of methotrexate may permit the return to conventional topical ther-\napy, which should be encouraged.\nHandling and Disposal: Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer\ndrugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been pub-\nlished.1-7 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended\nin the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.\nReconstitution of Lyophilized Powders: Reconstitute immediately prior to use. \nMethotrexate for injection should be reconstituted with an appropriate sterile, pre-\nservative free medium such as 5% dextrose solution, USP or sodium chloride\ninjection, USP. The 1 gram vial should be reconstituted with 19.4 mL to a con-\ncentration of 50 mg/mL. When high doses of methotrexate are administered by IV\ninfusion, the total dose is diluted in 5% dextrose solution, USP. \nFor intrathecal injection, reconstitute to a concentration of 1 mg/mL with an appro-\npriate sterile, preservative free medium such as sodium chloride injection, USP. \nDilution Instructions for Liquid Methotrexate Injection: Isotonic liquid, preserva-\ntive free, for single use only. \nIf desired, the solution may be further diluted immediately prior to use with an\nappropriate sterile, preservative free medium such as 5% dextrose solution, USP\nor sodium chloride injection, USP. \nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and dis-\ncoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\nHOW SUPPLIED\nMethotrexate Injection, USP (preservative free) is supplied in a single-dose vial\ncontaining 25 mg/mL of methotrexate as the base in the following package\nstrengths:\nNDC 55390-031-10\n50 mg in 2 mL (10 vials to a carton)\nNDC 55390-032-10\n100 mg in 4 mL (10 vials to a carton)\nNDC 55390-033-10\n200 mg in 8 mL (10 vials to a carton)\nNDC 55390-034-10\n250 mg in 10 mL (10 vials to a carton)\nMethotrexate for Injection, USP (preservative free) is supplied in a 1 gram, single-\ndose vial of lyophilized powder containing 1 gram methotrexate as the base in the\nfollowing package strength:\nNDC 55390-143-01\n1 gram Vial (individually boxed)\nStore at room temperature 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F).

This con-\ndition can be progressive and even fatal.\nPulmonary - Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) or a\nnonspecific pneumonitis occurring during methotrexate therapy may be indicative\nof a potentially dangerous lesion and require interruption of treatment and careful\ninvestigation. Although clinically variable, the typical patient with methotrexate\ninduced lung disease presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and an infil-\ntrate on chest X-ray; infection (including pneumonia) needs to be excluded. This\nlesion can occur at all dosages.\nRenal \u2013 Methotrexate may cause renal damage that may lead to acute renal failure.\nHigh doses of methotrexate used in the treatment of osteosarcoma may cause\nrenal damage leading to acute renal failure. Nephrotoxicity is due primarily to the\nprecipitation of methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate in the renal tubules.\nClose attention to renal function including adequate hydration, urine alkalinization\nand measurement of serum methotrexate and creatinine levels are essential for\nsafe administration.\nSkin - Severe, occasionally fatal, dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal\nnecrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, skin necrosis, and ery-\nthema multiforme, have been reported in children and adults, within days of oral, intra-\nmuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration.  Reactions were\nnoted after single or multiple, low, intermediate or high doses of methotrexate in patients\nwith neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases.\nOther Precautions - Methotrexate should be used with extreme caution in the pres-\nence of debility.\nMethotrexate exits slowly from third space compartments (e.g., pleural effusions or\nascites). This results in a prolonged terminal plasma half-life and unexpected toxicity. In\npatients with significant third space accumulations, it is advisable to evacuate the fluid\nbefore treatment and to monitor plasma methotrexate levels.\nLesions of psoriasis may be aggravated by concomitant exposure to ultraviolet\nradiation. Radiation dermatitis and sunburn may be \u201crecalled\u201d by the use of\nmethotrexate.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nIN GENERAL, THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF ACUTE SIDE EFFECTS ARE\nRELATED TO DOSE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION. THE MOST SERI-\nOUS REACTIONS ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER ORGAN SYSTEM TOXICITY IN\nTHE PRECAUTIONS SECTION. THAT SECTION SHOULD ALSO BE CONSULTED\nWHEN LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ADVERSE REACTIONS WITH\nMETHOTREXATE.\nThe most frequently reported adverse reactions include ulcerative stomatitis,\nleukopenia, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other frequently reported adverse\neffects are malaise, undue fatigue, chills and fever, dizziness and decreased resist-\nance to infection.\nOther adverse reactions that have been reported with methotrexate are listed below\nby organ system. In the oncology setting, concomitant treatment and the underly-\ning disease make specific attribution of a reaction to methotrexate difficult.\nAlimentary System - gingivitis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, anorexia, nausea, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, hematemesis, melena, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, enteritis,\npancreatitis.\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders - suppressed hematopoiesis, anemia,\naplastic anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranu-\nlocytosis, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy and lymphoproliferative disorders (includ-\ning reversible). Hypogammaglobulinemia has been reported rarely. \nCardiovascular - pericarditis, pericardial effusion, hypotension, and thromboem-\nbolic events (including arterial thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, deep vein throm-\nbosis, retinal vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, and pulmonary embolus).\nCentral Nervous System - headaches, drowsiness, blurred vision, transient blind-\nness, speech impairment including dysarthria and aphasia, hemiparesis, paresis\nand convulsions have also occurred following administration of methotrexate.\nFollowing low doses, there have  been occasional reports of transient subtle cog-\nnitive dysfunction, mood alteration, unusual cranial sensations, leukoen-\ncephalopathy, or encephalopathy.\nHepatobiliary Disorders - hepatotoxicity, acute hepatitis, chronic fibrosis and cir-\nrhosis, hepatic failure, decrease in serum albumin, liver enzyme elevations. \nInfection - There have been case reports of sometimes fatal opportunistic infec-\ntions in patients receiving methotrexate therapy for neoplastic and non-neoplastic\ndiseases. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was the most common opportunistic\ninfection. There have also been reports of infections, pneumonia, cytomegalovirus\ninfection, including cytomegaloviral pneumonia, sepsis, fatal sepsis, nocardiosis;\nhistoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, Herpes zoster, H. simplex hepatitis, and dissemi-\nnated H. simplex.\nMusculoskeletal System - stress fracture.\nOphthalmic - conjunctivitis, serious visual changes of unknown etiology.\nPulmonary System \u2013 respiratory fibrosis, respiratory failure, alveolitis, interstitial\npneumonitis; deaths have been reported, and chronic interstitial obstructive pul-\nmonary disease has occasionally occurred. \nSkin - erythematous rashes, pruritus, urticaria, photosensitivity, pigmentary\nchanges, alopecia, ecchymosis, telangiectasia, acne, furunculosis, erythema mul-\ntiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin necrosis,\nskin ulceration, and exfoliative dermatitis.\nUrogenital System - severe nephropathy or renal failure, azotemia, cystitis, hematuria,\nproteinuria; defective oogenesis or spermatogenesis, transient oligospermia, men-\nstrual dysfunction, vaginal discharge, and gynecomastia; infertility, abortion, fetal\ndeath, fetal defects.\nOther rarer reactions related to or attributed to the use of methotrexate such as nodu-\nlosis, vasculitis, arthralgia/myalgia, loss of libido/impotence, diabetes, osteoporosis,\nsudden death, reversible lymphomas, tumor lysis syndrome, soft tissue necrosis, and\nosteonecrosis. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.\nAdverse Reactions in Double-Blind Rheumatoid Arthritis Studies: The approximate\nincidences of methotrexate-attributed (i.e., placebo rate subtracted) adverse reac-\ntions in 12 to 18 week double-blind studies of patients (n=128) with rheumatoid\narthritis treated with low-dose oral (7.5 to 15 mg/wk) pulse methotrexate, are listed\nbelow. Virtually all of these patients were on concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflam-\nmatory drugs and some were also taking low dosages of corticosteroids. Hepatic\nhistology was not examined in these short-term studies. (See PRECAUTIONS.)\nIncidence greater than 10%: Elevated liver function tests 15%, nausea/vomiting 10%.\nIncidence 3% to 10%: Stomatitis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than\n100,000/mm3).\nIncidence 1% to 3%: Rash/pruritus/dermatitis, diarrhea, alopecia, leukopenia\n(WBC less than 3000/mm3), pancytopenia, dizziness.\nTwo other controlled trials of patients (n=680) with Rheumatoid Arthritis on \n7.5 mg to 15 mg/wk oral doses showed an incidence of interstitial pneumonitis of\n1%. (See PRECAUTIONS.)\nOther less common reactions included decreased hematocrit, headache, upper\nrespiratory infection, anorexia, arthralgias, chest pain, coughing, dysuria, eye dis-\ncomfort, epistaxis, fever, infection, sweating, tinnitus, and vaginal discharge. \nAdverse Reactions in Psoriasis: There are no recent placebo-controlled trials in\npatients with psoriasis. There are two literature reports (Roenigk, 1969, and\nNyfors, 1978) describing large series (n=204, 248) of psoriasis patients treated\nwith methotrexate. Dosages ranged up to 25 mg per week and treatment was\nadministered for up to four years. With the exception of alopecia, photosensitivity,\nand \u201cburning of skin lesions\u201d (each 3 to 10%), the adverse reaction rates in these\nreports were very similar to those in the rheumatoid arthritis studies. Rarely,\npainful plaque erosions may appear (Pearce, HP and Wilson, BB: Am Acad\nDermatol 35: 835-838, 1996).\nAdverse Reactions in JRA Studies: The approximate incidences of adverse reac-\ntions reported in pediatric patients with JRA treated with oral, weekly doses of\nmethotrexate (5 to 20 mg/m2/wk or 0.1 to 0.65 mg/kg/wk) were as follows (virtu-\nally all patients were receiving concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\nand some also were taking low doses of corticosteroids): elevated liver function\ntests, 14%; gastrointestinal reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), 11%;\nstomatitis, 2%; leukopenia, 2%; headache, 1.2%; alopecia, 0.5%; dizziness, 0.2%;\nand rash, 0.2%. Although there is experience with dosing up to 30 mg/m2/wk in\nJRA, the published data for doses above 20 mg/m2/wk are too limited to provide\nreliable estimates of adverse reaction rates. \nOVERDOSAGE\nLeucovorin is indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effect of inad-\nvertently administered overdosages of methotrexate. Leucovorin administration\nshould begin as promptly as possible. As the time interval between methotrexate\nadministration and leucovorin initiation increases, the effectiveness of leucovorin\nin counteracting toxicity decreases. Monitoring of the serum methotrexate con-\ncentration is essential in determining the optimal dose and duration of treatment\nwith leucovorin. \nIn cases of massive overdosage, hydration and urinary alkalinization may be necessary\nto prevent the precipitation of methotrexate and/or its metabolites in the renal tubules.\nGenerally speaking, neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis have been shown to\nimprove methotrexate elimination. However, effective clearence of methotrexate has\nbeen reported with acute, intermittent hemodialysis using a high-flux dialyzer (Wall,\nSM et al: Am J Kidney Dis 28(6): 846-854, 1996).\nAccidental intrathecal overdosage may require intensive systemic support, high-\ndose systemic leucovorin, alkaline diuresis and rapid CSF drainage and ventricu-\nlolumbar perfusion.\nIn postmarketing experience, overdose with methotrexate has generally occurred\nwith oral and intrathecal administration, although intravenous and intramuscular\noverdose have also been reported. \nReports of oral overdose often indicate accidental daily administration instead of\nweekly (single or divided doses). Symptoms commonly reported following oral\noverdose include those symptoms and signs reported at pharmacologic doses,\nparticularly hematologic and gastrointestinal reaction. For example, leukopenia,\nthrombocytopenia, anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow suppression, mucositis,\nstomatitis, oral ulceration, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal ulceration, gastroin-\ntestinal bleeding. In some cases, no symptoms were reported. There have been\nreports of death following overdose. In these cases, events such as sepsis or sep-\ntic shock, renal failure, and aplastic anemia were also reported. \nSymptoms of intrathecal overdose are generally central nervous system (CNS)\nsymptoms, including headache, nausea and vomiting, seizure or convulsion, and\nacute toxic encephalopathy. In some cases, no symptoms were reported. There\nhave been reports of death following intrathecal overdose. In these cases, cere-\nbellar herniation associated with increased intracranial pressure, and acute toxic\nencephalopathy have also been reported. \nThere are published case reports of intravenous and intrathecal carboxypeptidase\nG2 treatment to hasten clearance of methotrexate in cases of overdose. \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\nNeoplastic Diseases: Oral administration in tablet form is often preferred when low\ndoses are being administered since absorption is rapid and effective serum levels are\nobtained. Methotrexate sodium (preservative free) injectable products may be given by\nthe intramuscular, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intrathecal route. Parenteral drug prod-\nucts should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to admin-\nistration whenever solution and container permit.\nChoriocarcinoma and Similar Trophoblastic Diseases - Methotrexate is adminis-\ntered orally or intramuscularly in doses of 15 to 30 mg daily for a 5-day course.\nSuch courses are usually repeated for 3 to 5 times as required, with rest periods\nof one or more weeks interposed between courses, until any manifesting toxic\nsymptoms subside. The effectiveness of therapy is ordinarily evaluated by 24-hour\nquantitative analysis of urinary chorionic gonadatropin (hCG), which should return\nto normal or less than 50 IU/24 hr usually after the third or fourth course and usu-\nally be followed by a complete resolution of measurable lesions in 4 to 6 weeks.\nOne to two courses of methotrexate after normalization of hCG is usually recom-\nmended. Before each course of the drug careful clinical assessment is essential.\nCyclic combination therapy of methotrexate with other antitumor drugs has been\nreported as being useful.\nSince hydatidiform mole may precede choriocarcinoma, prophylactic chemother-\napy with methotrexate has been recommended.\nChorioadenoma destruens is considered to be an invasive form of hydatidiform\nmole. Methotrexate is administered in these disease states in doses similar to\nthose recommended for choriocarcinoma.\nLeukemia - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in pediatric patients and young adoles-\ncents is the most responsive to present day chemotherapy. In young adults and\nolder patients, clinical remission is more difficult to obtain and early relapse is\nmore common.\nMethotrexate alone or in combination with steroids was used initially for induction\nof remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemias. More recently corticosteroid ther-\napy, in combination with other antileukemic drugs or in cyclic combinations with\nmethotrexate included, has appeared to produce rapid and effective remissions.\nWhen used for induction, methotrexate in doses of 3.3 mg/m2 in combination with\n60 mg/m2 of prednisone, given daily, produced remissions in 50% of patients\ntreated, usually within a period of 4 to 6 weeks. Methotrexate in combination with\nother agents appears to be the drug of choice for securing maintenance of drug-\ninduced remissions. When remission is achieved and supportive care has pro-\nduced general clinical improvement, maintenance therapy is initiated, as follows:\nmethotrexate is administered 2 times weekly either by mouth or intramuscularly in total\nweekly doses of 30 mg/m2. It has also been given in doses of 2.5 mg/kg intravenously\nevery 14 days. If and when relapse does occur, reinduction of remission can again usu-\nally be obtained by repeating the initial induction regimen.\nA variety of combination chemotherapy regimens have been used for both induc-\ntion and maintenance therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The physician\nshould be familiar with the new advances in antileukemic therapy.\nMeningeal Leukemia - In the treatment or prophylaxis of meningeal leukemia,\nmethotrexate must be administered intrathecally. Preservative free methotrexate is\ndiluted to a concentration of 1 mg/mL with an appropriate sterile, preservative free\nmedium such as 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.\nThe cerebrospinal fluid volume is dependent on age and not body surface area. The\nCSF is at 40% of the adult volume at birth and reaches the adult volume in sever-\nal years.\nIntrathecal methotrexate administration at a dose of 12 mg/m2 (maximum 15 mg)\nhas been reported to result in low CSF methotrexate concentrations and reduced\nefficacy in pediatric patients and high concentrations and neurotoxicity in adults.\nThe following dosage regimen is based on age instead of body surface area:\nAge (years)\nDose (mg)\n<1\n6\n1\n8\n2\n10\n3 or older\n12\nIn one study in patients under the age of 40, this dosage regimen appeared to result\nin more consistent CSF methotrexate concentrations and less neurotoxicity.\nAnother study in pediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia compared the\nabove regimen to a dose of 12 mg/m2 (maximum 15 mg). A significant reduction\nin the rate of CNS relapse was observed in the group whose dose was based on age.\nBecause the CSF volume and turnover may decrease with age, a dose reduction\nmay be indicated in elderly patients.\nFor the treatment of meningeal leukemia, intrathecal methotrexate may be given at\nintervals of 2 to 5 days. However, administration at intervals of less than 1 week\nmay result in increased subacute toxicity. Methotrexate is administered until the\ncell count of the cerebrospinal fluid returns to normal. At this point one additional\ndose is advisable. For prophylaxis against meningeal leukemia, the dosage is the\nsame as for treatment except for the intervals of administration. On this subject, it\nis advisable for the physician to consult the medical literature.\nUntoward side effects may occur with any given intrathecal injection and are com-\nmonly neurological in character. Large doses may cause convulsions.\nMethotrexate given by the intrathecal route appears significantly in the systemic\ncirculation and may cause systemic methotrexate toxicity. Therefore, systemic\nantileukemic therapy with the drug should be appropriately adjusted, reduced or\ndiscontinued. Focal leukemic involvement of the central nervous system may not\nrespond to intrathecal chemotherapy and is best treated with radiotherapy.\nLymphomas - In Burkitt\u2019s Tumor, Stages I-II, methotrexate has produced pro-\nlonged remissions in some cases. Recommended dosage is 10 to 25 mg/day oral-\nly for 4 to 8 days. In Stage III, methotrexate is commonly given concomitantly with\nother antitumor agents. Treatment in all stages usually consists of several cours-\nes of the drug interposed with 7 to 10 day rest periods. Lymphosarcomas in Stage\nIII may respond to combined drug therapy with methotrexate given in doses of\n0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg daily.\nMycosis Fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma) \u2013 Therapy with methotrexate as\na single agent appears to produce clinical responses in up to 50% of patients treat-\ned. Dosage in early stages is usually 5 to 50 mg once weekly. Dose reduction or\ncessation is guided by patient response and hematologic monitoring. Methotrexate\nhas also been administered twice weekly in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg in\npatients who have responded poorly to weekly therapy. Combination chemothera-\npy regimens that include intravenous methotrexate administered at higher doses\nwith leucovorin rescue have been utilized in advanced stages of the disease.\nOsteosarcoma - An effective adjuvant chemotherapy regimen requires the adminis-\ntration of several cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. In addition to high-dose\nmethotrexate with leucovorin rescue, these agents may include doxorubicin, cis-\nplatin, and the combination of bleomycin, cyclophosphamide and dactinomycin\n(BCD) in the doses and schedule shown in the table below. The starting dose for\nhigh dose methotrexate treatment is 12 grams/m2. If this dose is not sufficient to\nproduce a peak serum methotrexate concentration of 1,000 micromolar \n(10-3 mol/L) at the end of the methotrexate infusion, the dose may be escalated to \n15 grams/m2 in subsequent treatments. If the patient is vomiting or is unable to tol-\nerate oral medication, leucovorin is given IV or IM at the same dose and schedule.\nPage 130\n \n",

This includes, but is not limited to, congenital\nagammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe\ncombined immuno deficiencies.\n2\u20139\n1.2\nIdiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)\nGAMUNEX is indicated in Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura to rapidly raise platelet counts to prevent bleeding or to allow a patient with\nITP to undergo surgery.\n10\u201315\n1.3\nChronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)\nGAMUNEX is indicated for the treatment of CIDP to improve neuromuscular disability and impairment and for maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.\n2\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\nFor intravenous use only.\nGAMUNEX consists of 9%\u201311% protein in 0.16\u20130.24 M glycine. The buffering capacity of GAMUNEX is 35.0 mEq/L (0.35 mEq/g protein). A\ndose of 1 g/kg body weight therefore represents an acid load of 0.35 mEq/kg body weight. The total buffering capacity of whole blood in a\nnormal individual is 45\u201350 mEq/L of blood, or 3.6 mEq/kg body weight.16 Thus, the acid load delivered with a dose of 1 g/kg of GAMUNEX\nwould be neutralized by the buffering capacity of whole blood alone, even if the dose was infused instantaneously.\n2.1\nPreparation and Handling\n\u2022 GAMUNEX should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container\npermit. Do not use if turbid.\n\u2022 Do not freeze. Solutions that have been frozen should not be used.\n\u2022 The GAMUNEX vial is for single use only. GAMUNEX contains no preservative. Any vial that has been entered should be used promptly.\nPartially used vials should be discarded.\n\u2022 GAMUNEX should be infused using a separate line by itself, without mixing with other intravenous fluids or medications the subject might\nbe receiving.\n\u2022 GAMUNEX is not compatible with saline. If dilution is required, GAMUNEX may be diluted with 5% dextrose in water (D5/W). No other drug\ninteractions or compatibilities have been evaluated.\n\u2022 Content of vials may be pooled under aseptic conditions into sterile infusion bags and infused within 8 hours after pooling.\n\u2022 Do not mix with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products from other manufacturers.\n\u2022 Do not use after expiration date.\n2.2\nTreatment of Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency\nAs there are significant differences in the half-life of IgG among patients with primary immunodeficiencies, the frequency and amount of\nimmunoglobulin therapy may vary from patient to patient. The proper amount can be determined by monitoring clinical response.\nThe dose of GAMUNEX for replacement therapy in primary immune deficiency diseases is 300 to 600 mg/kg body weight (3-6 mL/kg)\nadministered every 3 to 4 weeks. The dosage may be adjusted over time to achieve the desired trough levels and clinical responses.\nIf a patient routinely receives a dose of less than 400 mg/kg of GAMUNEX every 3 to 4 weeks (less than 4 mL/kg), and is at risk of measles\nexposure (i.e., traveling to a measles endemic area), administer a dose of  at least 400 mg/kg (4 mL/kg) just prior to the expected measles\nexposure. If a patient has been exposed to measles, a dose of 400 mg/kg (4 mL/kg) should be administered as soon as possible after exposure.\n2\nPage 133\n \n2.3\nTreatment of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\nGAMUNEX may be administered at a total dose of 2 g/kg, divided in two doses of 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) given on two consecutive days or into\nfive doses of 0.4 g/kg (4 mL/kg) given on five consecutive days. If after administration of the first of two daily 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) doses, an\nadequate increase in the platelet count is observed at 24 hours, the second dose of 1g/kg body weight may be withheld.\nForty-eight ITP subjects were treated with 2 g/kg GAMUNEX, divided in two 1 g/kg doses (10 mL/kg) given on two successive days. With this\ndose regimen 35/39 subjects (90%) responded with a platelet count from less than or equal to 20 x109/L to more than or equal to 50 x109/L\nwithin 7 days after treatment.\n17\nThe high dose regimen (1 g/kg \ufffd1-2 days) is not recommended for individuals with expanded fluid volumes or where fluid volume may be\na concern.\n2.4\nTreatment of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy\nGAMUNEX may be initially administered as a total loading dose of 2 g/kg (20 mL/kg) given in divided doses over two to four consecutive days.\nGAMUNEX may be administered as a maintenance infusion of 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) administered over 1 day or divided into two doses of 0.5\ng/kg (5 mL/kg) given on two consecutive days, every 3 weeks.\n2.5\nAdministration\nGAMUNEX should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\nDo not use if turbid and/or if discoloration is observed.\nOnly administer intravenously. GAMUNEX should be at room temperature during administration.\nOnly 18 gauge needles should be used to penetrate the stopper for dispensing product from the 10 mL vial; 16 gauge needles or dispensing\npins should only be used with 25 mL vial sizes and larger. Needles or dispensing pins should only be inserted once and be within the stopper\narea delineated by the raised ring. The stopper should be penetrated perpendicular to the plane of the stopper within the ring.\nGAMUNEX\u00ae vial size\nGauge of needle to penetrate stopper\n10 mL\n18 gauge\n25, 50, 100, 200 mL\n16 gauge\nAny vial that has been opened should be used promptly. Partially used vials should be discarded.\nIf dilution is required, GAMUNEX may be diluted with 5% dextrose in water (D5/W).\nRate of Administration\nIt is recommended that GAMUNEX should initially be infused at a rate of 0.01 mL/kg per minute (1 mg/kg per minute) for the first 30 minutes.\nIf well-tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 0.08 mL/kg per minute (8 mg/kg per minute). \nIndication\nInitial infusion rate\nMaximum infusion rate\n(first 30 minutes)\n(if tolerated)\nPI \n1 mg/kg/min\n8 mg/kg/min\nITP\n1 mg/kg/min\n8 mg/kg/min\nCIDP\n2 mg/kg/min\n8 mg/kg/min\nCertain severe adverse drug reactions may be related to the rate of infusion. Slowing or stopping the infusion usually allows the symptoms to\ndisappear promptly.\nEnsure that patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency are not volume depleted; discontinue GAMUNEX if renal function deteriorates.\nFor patients at risk of renal dysfunction or thromboembolic events, administer GAMUNEX at the minimum infusion rate practicable.\nIncompatibilities\nGAMUNEX is not compatible with saline. If dilution is required, GAMUNEX may be diluted with 5% dextrose in water (D5/W). No other drug\ninteractions or compatibilities have been evaluated.\nShelf Life\nGAMUNEX may be stored for 36 months at 2-8\u00baC (36-46\u00baF) from the date of manufacture AND product may be stored at temperatures not\nto exceed 25\u00baC (77\u00baF) for up to 6 months any time during the 36 month shelf life, after which the product must be immediately discarded.\nSpecial Precautions for Storage\nDo not freeze. Frozen product should not be used.\nDo not use after expiration date.\n3\nDOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTH\nGAMUNEX is supplied in 1 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, 10 g, or 20 g single use bottles.\n\u2022 1 g in 10 mL solution \n\u2022 2.5 g in 25 mL solution \n\u2022 5 g in 50 mL solution \n\u2022 10 g in 100 mL solution \n\u2022 20 g in 200 mL solution \n3\nPage 134\n \n4\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\n\u2022 GAMUNEX is contraindicated in individuals with acute severe hypersensitivity reactions to Immune Globulin (Human).\n\u2022 GAMUNEX contains trace amounts of IgA. It is contraindicated in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and history of hyper sensitivity.\n(See Description [11])\n5\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n5.1\nSensitivity \nSevere hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In case of hypersensitivity, IGIV infusion should be immediately discontinued and appropriate\ntreatment instituted. Epinephrine should be immediately available for treatment of acute severe hypersensitivity reaction. (See Patient\nCounseling Information [17])\nGAMUNEX contains trace amounts of IgA (average 46 micrograms/mL). It is contraindicated in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against\nIgA and history of hypersensitivity. (See Patient Counseling Information [17])\n5.2\nRenal Failure\nAssure that patients are not volume depleted prior to the initiation of the infusion of IGIV. Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output\nis particularly important in patients judged to have a potential increased risk for developing acute renal failure. Renal function, including\nmeasurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/serum creatinine, should be assessed prior to the initial infusion of GAMUNEX and again at\nappropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, discontinuation of the product should be considered. (See Patient Counseling\nInformation [17]) For patients judged to be at risk for developing renal dysfunction and/or at risk of developing thrombotic events, it may be\nprudent to reduce the amount of product infused per unit time by infusing GAMUNEX at a rate less than 8 mg IG/kg/min (0.08 mL/kg/min).\n(See Boxed Warning) (See Dosage and Administration [2.5])\n5.3\nHyperproteinemia\nHyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy. The hyponatremia is likely to be\na pseudohyponatremia as demonstrated by a decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap. Distinguishing true hypona-\ntremia from pseudohyponatremia is clinically critical, as treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia\nmay lead to volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity and a disposition to thromboembolic events.\n18\n5.4\nThrombotic Events\nThrombotic events have been reported in association with IGIV.19\u201321 Patients at risk may include those with a history of atherosclerosis,\nmultiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired cardiac output, coagulation disorders, prolonged periods of immobilization\nand/or known or suspected hyperviscosity. The potential risks and benefits of IGIV should be weighed against those of alternative therapies\nfor all patients for whom IGIV administration is being considered. Baseline assessment of blood viscosity should be considered in patients\nat risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or\nmonoclonal gammopathies.\n5.5\nAseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS) \nAn aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)\ntreatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.22\u201324 The syndrome usually\nbegins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment. It is characterized by symptoms and signs including severe headache, nuchal\nrigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive\nwith pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cu mm, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several\nhundred mg/dl. Patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs should receive a thorough neurological examination, including CSF studies, to\nrule out other causes of meningitis. It appears that patients with a history of migraine may be more susceptible. (See Patient Counseling\nInformation [17])\n5.6\nHemolysis \nImmune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo\ncoating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis.\n25\u201327 Hemolytic anemia can\ndevelop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration. IGIV recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms\nof hemolysis.\n28 If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after IGIV infusion, appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing should be\ndone. (See Patient Counseling Information [17])\n5.7\nTransfusion-related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)\nThere have been reports of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)] in patients administered\nIGIV.\n29 TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever and\ntypically occurs within 1-6 hrs after transfusion. Patients with TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory\nsupport. \nIGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions. (See Patient Counseling Information [17]) If TRALI is suspected,\nappropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum.\n5.8\nVolume Overload\nThe high dose regimen (1 g/kg \ufffd1-2 days) is not recommended for individuals with expanded fluid volumes or where fluid volume may be\na concern.\n4\nPage 135\n \n5.9\nGeneral\nBecause this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and, theoretically, the\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) agent. ALL infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by\nthe physician or other healthcare provider to Talecris Biotherapeutics, Inc. [1-800-520-2807]. The physician should discuss the risks and\nbenefits of this product with the patient, before prescribing or administering it to the patient. (See Patient Counseling Information [17])\n5.10 Laboratory Tests\nIf signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after IGIV infusion, appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing should be done.\nIf TRALI is suspected, appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient\nserum.\nBecause of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis, baseline assessment of blood viscosity should be considered in patients at risk for\nhyper viscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylo micro nemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal\ngammopathies. \n6\nADVERSE REACTIONS\n6.1\nAdverse Drug Reaction Overview\nThe most serious adverse reaction observed in clinical study subjects receiving GAMUNEX for PI was an exacerbation of autoimmune pure\nred cell aplasia in one subject.\nThe most serious adverse reaction observed in clinical study subjects receiving GAMUNEX for ITP was myocarditis in one subject that occurred\n50 days post study drug infusion and was not considered drug related.\nThe most serious adverse reaction observed in clinical study subjects receiving GAMUNEX for CIDP was pulmonary embolism (PE) in one\nsubject with a history of PE.\nThe most common drug related adverse reactions observed at a rate \ufffd5% in subjects with PI were headache, cough, injection site reaction,\nnausea, pharyngitis and urticaria.\nThe most common drug related adverse reactions observed at a rate \ufffd5% in subjects with ITP were headache, vomiting, fever, nausea, back\npain and rash.\nThe most common drug related adverse reactions observed at a rate \ufffd5% in subjects with CIDP were headache, fever, chills, hypertension,\nrash, nausea and asthenia.\n6.2\nClinical Trials Adverse Drug Reactions\nBecause clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates\nin other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nAdverse events similar to those previously reported with the administration of intravenous and intramuscular immunoglobulin products may\noccur. Cases of reversible aseptic meningitis, migraine, isolated cases of reversible hemolytic anemia and reversible increases in liver function\ntests have been observed with GAMUNEX. Immediate anaphylactic reactions can possibly occur (<0.01%). Epinephrine should be available\nfor treatment of any acute anaphylactoid reaction. (see Warnings and Precautions [5.1])\nTreatment of Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency\nThe following table shows the number of subjects treated with GAMUNEX in clinical trials to study PI, and the reason for discontinuation due\nto adverse events:\nTable 1: Reasons for Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events: All PI Studies\nStudy Number\nNumber of Subjects \nNumber of Subjects Discontinued \nAdverse Event\nTreated with GAMUNEX\u00ae\nDue to Adverse Events\n100152\n18\n0\n-----\n100174\n20\n1\nCoombs negative hypochromic anemia*\n100175\n87\n1\nAutoimmune pure red cell aplasia*\n* Both events were considered unrelated to study drug as per the investigator.\nIn study 100175, 9 subjects in each treatment group were pretreated with non-steroidal medication prior to infusion.

The infusion rate\nwas reduced for 11 of 222 exposed subjects (7 GAMUNEX, 4 GAMIMUNE N, 10%) at 17 occasions. In most instances, mild to moderate\nhives/urticaria, itching, pain or reaction at infusion site, anxiety or headache was the main reason. There was one case of severe chills. There\nwere no anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions to GAMUNEX or GAMIMUNE N, 10%. \nIn trial 100175, serum samples were drawn to monitor the viral safety at baseline and one week after the first infusion (for parvovirus B19),\neight weeks after first and fifth infusion, and 16 weeks after the first and fifth infusion of IGIV (for hepatitis C) and at any time of premature\ndiscontinuation of the study. Viral markers of hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV-1, and parvovirus B19 were monitored by nucleic acid testing (NAT,\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)), and serological testing. There were no treatment emergent findings of viral transmission for either\nGAMUNEX or GAMIMUNE N, 10%.\n30\u201332\nTreatment of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\nThe following table shows the number of subjects treated with GAMUNEX in clinical trials to study ITP, and the reason for discontinuation due\nto adverse events: \nTable 5: Reasons for Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events: All ITP Studies\nStudy Number\nNumber of Subjects \nNumber of Subjects \nAdverse Event\nTreated with GAMUNEX\u00ae\nDiscontinued Due to Adverse Events\n100213\n28\n1\nHives\n100176\n48\n1\nHeadache, Fever, Vomiting\nOne subject, a 10-year-old boy, died suddenly from myocarditis 50 days after his second infusion of GAMUNEX.

Twelve (12) ITP subjects treated in each treatment group were pretreated\nwith medication prior to infusion. Generally, diphenhydramine and/or acetaminophen were used. More than 90% of the observed drug related\nadverse events were of mild to moderate severity and of transient nature. \nThe infusion rate was reduced for 4 of the 97 exposed subjects (1 GAMUNEX, 3 GAMIMUNE N, 10%) on 4 occasions. Mild to moderate headache,\nnausea, and fever were the reported reasons.

Viral markers of hepatitis C, hepatitis B,\nHIV-1, and parvovirus B19 were monitored by nucleic acid testing (NAT, PCR), and serological testing. There were no treatment related\nemergent findings of viral transmission for either GAMUNEX\u00ae, Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% Caprylate/Chromatography\nPurified, or GAMIMUNE\u00ae N, Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10%.\n17\nTreatment of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy\nIn study 100538, 113 subjects were exposed to GAMUNEX and 95 were exposed to Placebo. (See Clinical Studies [14.3]) As a result of the\nstudy design, the drug exposure with GAMUNEX was almost twice that of Placebo, with 1096 GAMUNEX infusions versus 575 Placebo\ninfusions. Therefore, adverse reactions are reported per infusion (represented as frequency) to correct for differences in drug exposure between\nthe 2 groups.

Direct antiglobulin tests (DAT or direct\nCoombs tests), which are carried out in some centers as a safety check prior to red blood cell transfusions, may become positive temporarily.\nHemolytic events not associated with positive DAT findings were observed in clinical trials.\n17, 30\u201333\n6.3\nPostmarketing Experience\nBecause postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably\nestimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.\nGAMUNEX Postmarketing Experience\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during the post marketing use of GAMUNEX:\n\u2022 Hematologic: Hemolytic anemia\n\u2022 Infections and Infestations: Aseptic meningitis\nGeneral\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during the post marketing use of IGIV products\n34:\n\u2022 Respiratory: Apnea, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), TRALI, cyanosis, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, dyspnea,\nbronchospasm\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, vascular collapse, hypotension\n\u2022 Neurological: Coma, loss of consciousness, seizures/convulsions, tremor\n\u2022 Integumentary: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, epidermolysis, erythema multiforme, bullous dermatitis\n\u2022 Hematologic: Pancytopenia, leukopenia, hemolysis, positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs test)\n\u2022 General/Body as a Whole: Pyrexia, rigors\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Back pain\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Hepatic dysfunction, abdominal pain\n7\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\nGAMUNEX may be diluted with 5% dextrose in water (D5/W). Admixtures of GAMUNEX with other drugs and intravenous solutions have not\nbeen evaluated. It is recommended that GAMUNEX be administered separately from other drugs or medications which the patient may be\nreceiving. The product should not be mixed with IGIVs from other manufacturers.\n9\nPage 140\n \nThe infusion line may be flushed before and after administration of GAMUNEX with 5% dextrose in water.\nVarious passively transferred antibodies in immunoglobulin preparations can confound the results of serological testing.\nAntibodies in GAMUNEX may interfere with the response to live viral vaccines such as measles, mumps and rubella. Physicians should be\ninformed of recent therapy with IGIVs, so that administration of live viral vaccines, if indicated, can be appropriately delayed 3 or more months\nfrom the time of IGIV administration. (See Patient Counseling Information [17])\n8\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n8.1\nPregnancy \nPregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with GAMUNEX. It is not known whether GAMUNEX can cause\nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. GAMUNEX should be given to a pregnant woman\nonly if clearly needed. \n8.3\nNursing Mothers\nGAMUNEX has not been evaluated in nursing mothers.\n8.4\nPediatric Use\nTreatment of Primary Immunodeficiency\nGAMUNEX was evaluated in 18 pediatric subjects (age range 0-16 years). Twenty-one percent of PI subjects (Study 100175) exposed to\nGAMUNEX were children. Pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy were similar to those in adults with the exception that vomiting was more\nfrequently reported in pediatrics (3 of 18 subjects). No pediatric-specific dose requirements were necessary to achieve serum IgG levels. \nOne subject, a 10-year-old boy, died suddenly from myocarditis 50 days after his second infusion of GAMUNEX. The death was judged to be\nunrelated to GAMUNEX.\nTreatment of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\nGAMUNEX was evaluated in 12 pediatric subjects with acute ITP. Twenty-five percent of the acute ITP subjects (Study 100176) exposed to\nGAMUNEX were children. Pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy were similar to those in adults with the exception that fever was more\nfrequently reported in pediatrics (6 of 12 subjects). No pediatric-specific dose requirements were necessary to achieve serum IgG levels.\nTreatment of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy\nThe safety and effectiveness of GAMUNEX has not been established in pediatric subjects with CIDP.\n8.5\nGeriatric Use\nPatients > 65 years of age may be at increased risk for developing certain adverse reactions such as thromboembolic events and acute renal\nfailure. (See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions [5.2]) Clinical studies of GAMUNEX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged\n65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.\nTable 11: Clinical Studies of GAMUNEX\u00ae by Age Group\nNumber of Subjects\nClinical Study\nIndication\n< 65 years\n\ufffd 65 years\n100175\nPI\n78\n9\n100152\nPI\n18\n0\n100174\nPI\n20\n0\n10039\nPI\n19\n0\n100213\nITP\n22\n6\n100176\nITP\n44\n4\n10038\nITP\n18\n3\n100538\nCIDP\n44\n15\n11\nDESCRIPTION\nGAMUNEX is a ready-to-use sterile solution of human immune globulin protein for intravenous administration. GAMUNEX consists of 9%\u201311%\nprotein in 0.16\u20130.24 M glycine. Not less than 98% of the protein has the electrophoretic mobility of gamma globulin. GAMUNEX contains\ntrace levels of fragments, IgA (average 0.046 mg/mL), and IgM. The distribution of IgG subclasses is similar to that found in normal serum.\nGAMUNEX doses of 1 g/kg correspond to a glycine dose of 0.15 g/kg. While toxic effects of glycine administration have been reported,35 the\ndoses and rates of administration were 3 \u2013 4 fold greater than those for GAMUNEX. In another study, it was demonstrated that intravenous\nbolus doses of 0.44 g/kg glycine were not associated with serious adverse effects.\n36 Caprylate is a saturated medium-chain (C8) fatty acid of\nplant origin. Medium chain fatty acids are considered to be essentially non-toxic. Human subjects receiving medium chain fatty acids parenterally\nhave tolerated doses of 3.0 to 9.0 g/kg/day for periods of several months without adverse effects.37 Residual caprylate concentrations in the final\ncontainer are no more than 0.216 g/L (1.3 mmol/L).The measured buffer capacity is 35 mEq/L and the osmolality is 258 mOsmol/kg solvent,\nwhich is close to physiological osmolality (285-295 mOsmol/kg). The pH of GAMUNEX is 4.0 \u2013 4.5. GAMUNEX contains no preservative and\nis latex-free.\n10\nPage 141\n \nGAMUNEX is made from large pools of human plasma by a combination of cold ethanol fractionation, caprylate precipitation and filtration,\nand anion-exchange chromatography. Isotonicity is achieved by the addition of glycine. GAMUNEX is incubated in the final container (at the\nlow pH of 4.0 \u2013 4.3), for a minimum of 21 days at 23\u00b0 to 27\u00b0C. The product is intended for intravenous administration.\nThe capacity of the manufacturing process to remove and/or inactivate enveloped and non-enveloped viruses has been validated by laboratory\nspiking studies on a scaled down process model, using the following enveloped and non-enveloped viruses: human immunodeficiency virus,\ntype I (HIV-1) as the relevant virus for HIV-1 and HIV\u20132; bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) as a model for hepatitis C virus; pseudorabies virus\n(PRV) as a model for large DNA viruses (e.g., herpes viruses); Reo virus type 3 (Reo) as a model for non-enveloped viruses and for its\nresistance to physical and chemical inactivation; hepatitis A virus (HAV) as relevant non-enveloped virus, and porcine parvovirus (PPV) as a\nmodel for human parvovirus B19.\nOverall virus reduction was calculated only from steps that were mechanistically independent from each other and truly additive. In addition,\neach step was verified to provide robust virus reduction across the production range for key operating parameters.\nTable 12: Log10 Virus Reduction\nLog10 Virus Reduction\nProcess Step\nEnveloped Viruses\nNon-enveloped Viruses\nHIV\nPRV\nBVDV\nReo\nHAV\nPPV\nCaprylate Precipitation/Depth Filtration\nC/I a\nC/I\n2.7\n\ufffd3.5\n\ufffd3.6\n4.0\nCaprylate Incubation\n\ufffd4.5\n\ufffd4.6\n\ufffd4.5\nNA b\nNA\nNA\nDepth Filtration d\nCAP\nc\nCAP\nCAP\n\ufffd4.3\n\ufffd2.0\n3.3\nColumn Chromatography\n\ufffd3.0\n\ufffd3.3\n4.0\n\ufffd4.0\n\ufffd1.4\n4.2\nLow pH Incubation (21 days)\n\ufffd6.5\n\ufffd4.3\n\ufffd5.1\nNA\nNA\nNA\nGlobal Reduction\n\ufffd14.0\n\ufffd12.2\n\ufffd16.3\n\ufffd7.5\n\ufffd5.0\n8.2\na C/I - Interference by caprylate precluded determination of virus reduction for this step. Although removal of viruses is likely to occur at the\ncaprylate precipitation/depth filtration step, BVDV is the only enveloped virus for which reduction is claimed. The presence of caprylate\nprevents detection of other, less resistant enveloped viruses and therefore their removal cannot be assessed.\nb Not Applicable \u2013 This step has no effect on non-enveloped viruses.\nc CAP - The presence of caprylate in the process at this step prevents detection of enveloped viruses, and their removal cannot be assessed.\nd Some mechanistic overlap occurs between depth filtration and other steps. Therefore, Talecris Biotherapeutics, Inc. has chosen to exclude\nthis step from the global virus reduction calculations.\nAdditionally, the manufacturing process was investigated for its capacity to decrease the infectivity of an experimental agent of transmissible\nspongiform encephalopathy (TSE), considered as a model for the vCJD and CJD agents.\n38-42\nSeveral of the individual production steps in the GAMUNEX manufacturing process have been shown to decrease TSE infectivity of that experi-\nmental model agent. TSE reduction steps include two depth filtrations (in sequence, a total of \ufffd6.6 logs). These studies provide reasonable\nassurance that low levels of CJD/vCJD agent infectivity, if present in the starting material, would be removed. \n12\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nTreatment of Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency\nGAMUNEX supplies a broad spectrum of opsonic and neutralizing IgG antibodies against bacteria or their toxins. The mechanism of action in\nPI has not been fully elucidated.\nTreatment of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\nThe mechanism of action of high doses of immunoglobulins in the treatment of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) has not been fully\nelucidated.\nTreatment of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy\nThe precise mechanism of action in CIDP has not been fully elucidated.\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nTwo randomized pharmacokinetic crossover trials were carried out with GAMUNEX in 38 subjects with Primary Humoral\nImmunodeficiencies given 3 infusions 3 or 4 weeks apart of test product at a dose of 100-600 mg/kg body weight per infusion. One trial\ncompared the pharmacokinetic characteristics of GAMUNEX to GAMIMUNE N, 10% (study 100152), and the other trial compared the\npharmacokinetics of GAMUNEX (10% strength) with a 5% concentration of this product (study 100174). The ratio of the geometric least\nsquare means for dose-normalized IgG peak levels of GAMUNEX and GAMIMUNE N, 10% was 0.996. The corresponding value for the\ndose-normalized area under the curve (AUC) of IgG levels was 0.990. The results of both PK parameters were within the pre-established\nlimits of 0.080 and 1.25. Similar results were obtained in the comparison of GAMUNEX 10% to a 5% concentration of GAMUNEX.\n31, 32\n11\nPage 142\n \nThe main pharmacokinetic parameters of GAMUNEX, measured as total IgG in study 100152 are displayed below:\nTable 13: PK Parameters of GAMUNEX\u00ae and GAMIMUNE\u00ae N, 10% (Study 100152)\nGAMUNEX\u00ae\nGAMIMUNE\u00ae N, 10%\nN\nMean\nSD\nMedian\nN\nMean\nSD\nMedian\nCmax \n(mg/mL)\n17\n19.04\n3.06\n19.71\n17\n19.31\n4.17\n19.30\nCmax-norm\n(kg/mL)\n17\n0.047\n0.007\n0.046\n17\n0.047\n0.008\n0.047\nAUC(0-tn)a\n(mg*hr/mL)\n17\n6746.48\n1348.13\n6949.47\n17\n6854.17\n1425.08\n7119.86\nAUC(0-tn)norma\n(kg*hr/mL)\n17\n16.51\n1.83\n16.95\n17\n16.69\n2.04\n16.99\nT1\u20442\nb\n(days)\n16\n35.74\n8.69\n33.09\n16\n34.27\n9.28\n31.88\na Partial AUC: defined as pre-dose concentration to the last concentration common across both treatment periods in the same patient.\nb only 15 subjects were valid for the analysis of T1/2\nThe two pharmacokinetic trials with GAMUNEX show the IgG concentration/time curve follows a biphasic slope with a distribution phase of\nabout 5 days characterized by a fall in serum IgG levels to about 65-75% of the peak levels achieved immediately post-infusion.

Twenty six subjects were excluded from the Per\nProtocol analysis (2 due to non-compliance and 24 due to protocol violations). The endpoint was the proportion of subjects with at least one\nof the following validated infections: pneumonia, acute sinusitis and acute exacerbations of chronic sinusitis.\nTable 14: Primary Endpoint Per Protocol Analysis (Study 100175)\nGAMUNEX\u00ae\nGAMIMUNE\u00ae N, 10%\nMean Difference\np-Value\n(n=73)\n(n=73)\n(90% confidence interval)\nNo. of subjects with\nNo. of subjects with \nat least one infection\nat least one infection\nValidated Infections\n9 (12%)\n17 (23%)\n-0.117\n0.06\n(-0.220, -0.015)\nAcute Sinusitis\n4 (5%)\n10 (14%)\nExacerbation of \nChronic Sinusitis\n5 (7%)\n6 (8%)\nPneumonia\n0 (0%)\n2 (3%)\nAny Infection\n56 (77%)\n57 (78%)\n-0.020\n0.78\n(Validated plus \n(-0.135, 0.096)\nClinically defined \nnon-validated Infections)\nThe annual rate of validated infections (Number of Infections/year/subject) was 0.18 in the group treated with GAMUNEX and 0.43 in the group\ntreated with GAMIMUNE N, 10% (p=0.023). The annual rates for any infection (validated plus clinically-defined, non-validated infections of\nany organ system) were 2.88 and 3.38, respectively (p=0.300).30, 43\n14.2 Treatment of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\nA double-blind, randomized, parallel group clinical trial with 97 ITP subjects was carried out to prove the hypothesis that GAMUNEX was at\nleast as effective as GAMIMUNE N, 10% in raising platelet counts from less than or equal to 20 x109/L to more than 50 x109/L within 7 days\nafter treatment with 2 g/kg IGIV (study 100176). Twenty-four percent of the subjects were less than or equal to 16 years of age.\nGAMUNEX was demonstrated to be at least as effective as GAMIMUNE N, 10% in the treatment of adults and children with acute or\nchronic ITP.\n11\n12\nPage 143\n \nTable 15: Platelet Response of Per Protocol Analysis (Study 100176)\nGAMUNEX\u00ae\nGAMIMUNE\u00ae N, 10%\nMean Difference\n(n=39)\n(n=42)\n(90% confidence interval)\nBy Day 7\n35 (90%)\n35 (83%)\n0.075\n(-0.037, 0.186)\nBy Day 23\n35 (90%)\n36 (86%)\n0.051\n(-0.058, 0.160)\nSustained for 7 days\n29 (74%)\n25 (60%)\n0.164\n(0.003, 0.330)\nA trial was conducted to evaluate the clinical response to rapid infusion of GAMUNEX in patients with ITP. The study involved 28 chronic ITP\nsubjects, wherein the subjects received 1 g/kg GAMUNEX on three occasions for treatment of relapses. The infusion rate was randomly\nassigned to 0.08, 0.11, or 0.14 mL/kg/min (8, 11 or 14 mg/kg/min). Pre-medication with corticosteroids to alleviate infusion-related intolerability\nwas not permitted. Pre-treatment with antihistamines, anti-pyretics and analgesics was permitted. The average dose was approximately 1 g/kg\nbody weight at all three prescribed rates of infusion (0.08, 0.11 and 0.14 mL/kg/min). All patients were administered each of the three planned\ninfusions except seven subjects. Based on 21 patients per treatment group, the a posteriori power to detect twice as many drug-related adverse\nevents between groups was 23%. Of the seven subjects that did not complete the study, five did not require additional treatment, one withdrew\nbecause he refused to participate without concomitant medication (prednisone) and one experienced an adverse event (hives); however, this\nwas at the lowest dose rate level (0.08 mL/kg/min). \n14.3 Treatment of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy\nA multi-center, randomized, double-blind Placebo-controlled trial (study 100538, The Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10%\nCaprylate/Chromatography Purified CIDP Efficacy or ICE study) was conducted with GAMUNEX.44 This study included two separately\nrandomized study periods to assess whether GAMUNEX was more effective than Placebo for the treatment of CIDP (assessed in the Efficacy\nPeriod for up to 24 weeks) and whether long-term administration of GAMUNEX could maintain long-term benefit (assessed in the 24 week\nRandomized Withdrawal Period).\nIn the Efficacy Period, there was a requirement for Rescue (crossover) to the alternate study drug if the subject did not improve and maintain\nthis improvement until the end of the 24 week treatment period. Subjects entering the Rescue phase followed the same dosing and schedule\nas in the Efficacy period. Any subject who was Rescued (crossed over) and did not improve and maintain this improvement was withdrawn\nfrom the study. \nSubjects who completed 24 weeks treatment in the Efficacy period or Rescue phase and responded to therapy were eligible for entry into a\ndouble-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period. Eligible subjects were re-randomized to GAMUNEX or Placebo. Any subject who relapsed was\nwithdrawn from the study.\nThe Efficacy Period and the Rescue treatment started with a loading dose of 2 g/kg bw of GAMUNEX or equal volume of Placebo given over\n2-4 consecutive days. All other infusions (including the first infusion of the Randomized Withdrawal Period) were given as maintenance doses\nof 1 g/kg bw (or equivalent volume of Placebo) every three weeks.\nThe Responder rates of the GAMUNEX and Placebo treatment groups was measured by the INCAT score. The INCAT (Inflammatory Neuropathy\nCause and Treatment) scale is used to assess functional disability of both upper and lower extremities in demyelinating polyneuropathy. The\nINCAT scale has upper and lower extremity components (maximum of 5 points for upper (arm disability) and maximum of 5 points for lower\n(leg disability)) that add up to a maximum of 10-points (0 is normal and 10 is severely incapacitated).\n45 At the start of the efficacy portion of\nthe study, the INCAT scores were as follows: Upper Extremity mean was 2.2 \u00b1 1.0, and median was 2.0 with a range of 0 to 5; Lower Extremity\nmean was 1.9 \u00b1 0.9, and median was 2.0 with a range of 1 to 5; Total Overall Score mean was 4.2 \u00b1 1.4, and median was 4.0 with a range\nof 2 to 9. A Responder was defined as a subject with at least 1-point improvement from baseline in the adjusted INCAT score that was\nmaintained through 24 weeks. \nSignificantly more subjects with CIDP responded to GAMUNEX: 28 of 59 subjects (47.5%) responded to GAMUNEX compared with 13 of\n58 subjects (22.4%) administered Placebo (25% difference; [95% CI: 7%-43%]; p=0.006). The study included both subjects who were IGIV\nnaive and subjects who had previous IGIV experience. The outcome was influenced by the group of subjects who experienced prior therapy\nwith IGIV, as shown by the outcomes table, below. \nTime to relapse for the subset of 57 subjects who previously responded to GAMUNEX was evaluated: 31 were randomly reassigned to continue\nto receive GAMUNEX and 26 subjects were randomly reassigned to Placebo in the Randomized Withdrawal Period. Subjects who continued\nto receive GAMUNEX experienced a significantly longer time to relapse versus subjects treated with Placebo (p=0.011). The probability of\nrelapse was 13% with GAMUNEX versus 45% with Placebo (hazard ratio, 0.19 [95% confidence interval, 0.05, 0.70]).\n13\nPage 144\n \nTable 16: Outcomes in Intent-to-Treat Population Efficacy Period\nGAMUNEX\u00ae\nPlacebo\nEfficacy Period\nResponder\nNon-Responder\nResponder\nNon-Responder\np-value\na\nAll Subjects\n28/59 (47.5%)\n31/59 (52.5%)\n13/58 (22.4%)\n45/58 (77.6%)\n0.006\nIGIV - Na\u00efve Subjects\n17/39 (43.6%)\n22/39 (56.4%)\n13/46 (28.3%)\n33/46 (71.7%)\n0.174\nIGIV - Experienced Subjects\n11/20 (55.0%)\n9/20 (45.0%)\n0/12 (0%)\n12/12 (100%)\n0.002\na p-value based on Fisher\u2019s exact method\nThe following table shows outcomes for the Rescue Phase (which are supportive data):\nTable 17: Outcomes in Rescue Phase\nGAMUNEX\u00ae\nPlacebo\nRescue Phase\nSuccess\nFailure\nSuccess\nFailure\np-value\na\nAll Subjects\n25/45 (55.6%)\n20/45 (44.4%)\n6/23 (26.1%)\n17/23 (73.9%)\n0.038\nIGIV - Na\u00efve Subjects\n19/33(57.6%)\n14/33 (42.4%)\n6/18 (33.3%)\n12/18 (66.7%)\n0.144\nIGIV - Experienced Subjects\n6/12 (50%)\n6/12 (50%)\n0/5 (0%)\n5/5(100%)\n0.102\na p-value based on Fisher\u2019s exact method\nThe following Kaplan-Meier curves show the outcomes for the Randomized Withdrawal Period:\nFigure 1: Outcome for Randomized Withdrawal Period\nSecondary Endpoint\nTime to Relapse\np-valuea\nRandomized Withdrawal Period\np= 0.011\na p-value based on log-rank test\n15\nREFERENCES\n1.

Do\nnot use after expiration date.\n17\nPATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION \n(See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions Sections) \nInform patients to immediately report the following to their physician:\n\u2022 signs and symptoms of renal failures, such as decreased urine output, sudden weight gain, fluid retention/edema, and/or shortness of breath\n\u2022 signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, such as headache, neck stiffness, drowsiness, fever, sensitivity to light, painful eye movements,\nnausea, and vomiting\n\u2022 signs and symptoms of hemolysis, such as fatigue, increased heart rate, yellowing of the skin or eyes, and dark-colored urine\n\u2022 signs and symptoms of TRALI, such as severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and\nfever. TRALI typically occurs within 1 to 6 hours following transfusion.\nInform patients that GAMUNEX is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents that can cause disease (e.g., viruses, and,\ntheoretically, the CJD agent). Inform patients that the risk GAMUNEX may transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma\ndonors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing the donated plasma for certain virus infections and by inactivating and/or removing\ncertain viruses during manufacturing.\nInform patients that administration of IgG may interfere with the response to live viral vaccines such as measles, mumps and rubella. Inform\npatients to notify their immunizing physician of therapy with GAMUNEX.\nManufactured by:\nRx only \nTalecris Biotherapeutics, Inc.\nResearch Triangle Park, NC 27709 USA \n08939392/08939393\nU.S. License No. 1716\nOctober 2008\n16\nPage 147\n \n",

                        "Content": "Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0, DCTD, NCI, NIH, DHHS \n \nMarch 31, 2003 (http://ctep.cancer.gov), Publish Date: August 9, 2006 \nCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) \nPublish Date: August 9, 2006 \nQuick Reference \nThe NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \nv3.0 is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for \nAdverse Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity) scale is \nprovided for each AE term. \nComponents and Organization  \nCATEGORY \nA CATEGORY is a broad classification of AEs based on \nanatomy and/or pathophysiology. Within each CATEGORY, \nAEs are listed accompanied by their descriptions of severity \n(Grade). \nAdverse Event Terms \nAn AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an \nabnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally \nassociated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure \nthat may or may not be considered related to the medical \ntreatment or procedure. An AE is a term that is a unique \nrepresentation of a specific event used for medical \ndocumentation and scientific analyses. Each AE term is \nmapped to a MedDRA term and code. AEs are listed \nalphabetically within CATEGORIES. \nShort AE Name \nThe \u2018SHORT NAME\u2019 column is new and it is used to simplify \ndocumentation of AE names on Case Report Forms.   \nSupra-ordinate Terms  \nA supra-ordinate term is located within a CATEGORY and is a \ngrouping term based on disease process, signs, symptoms, \nor diagnosis. A supra-ordinate term is followed by the word \n\u2018Select\u2019 and is accompanied by specific AEs that are all \nrelated to the supra-ordinate term. Supra-ordinate terms \nprovide clustering and consistent representation of Grade for \nrelated AEs. Supra-ordinate terms are not AEs, are not \nmapped to a MedDRA term and code, cannot be graded and \ncannot be used for reporting. \nREMARK \nA \u2018REMARK\u2019 is a clarification of an AE. \nALSO CONSIDER \nAn \u2018ALSO CONSIDER\u2019 indicates additional AEs that are to be \ngraded if they are clinically significant. \nNAVIGATION NOTE \nA \u2018NAVIGATION NOTE\u2019 indicates the location of an AE term \nwithin the CTCAE document. It lists signs/symptoms \nalphabetically and the CTCAE term will appear in the same \nCATEGORY unless the \u2018NAVIGATION NOTE\u2019 states differently. \nGrades \nGrade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 \ndisplays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions \nof severity for each AE based on this general guideline: \nGrade 1 \nMild AE  \nGrade 2 \nModerate AE \nGrade 3 \nSevere AE \nGrade 4 \nLife-threatening or disabling AE \nGrade 5 \nDeath related to AE \nA Semi-colon indicates \u2018or\u2019 within the description of the grade. \nAn \u2018Em dash\u2019 (\u2014) indicates a grade not available. \nNot all Grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some \nAEs are listed with fewer than five options for Grade \nselection. \nGrade 5 \nGrade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and \ntherefore is not an option. \nThe DEATH CATEGORY is new. Only one Supra-ordinate \nterm is listed in this CATEGORY: \u2018Death not associated with \nCTCAE term \u2013 Select\u2019 with 4 AE options: Death NOS; \nDisease progression NOS; Multi-organ failure; Sudden death. \nImportant: \n\u2022 \nGrade 5 is the only appropriate Grade \n\u2022 \nThis AE is to be used in the situation where \na death  \n1. cannot be reported using a CTCAE v3.0 \nterm associated with Grade 5, or \n2. cannot be reported within a CTCAE \nCATEGORY as \u2018Other (Specify)\u2019 \n \n \n \n \n \nContents \nALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGY ............................................1 \nAUDITORY/EAR............................................................2 \nBLOOD/BONE MARROW .............................................4 \nCARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA..............................................5 \nCARDIAC GENERAL ....................................................7 \nCOAGULATION ..........................................................10 \nCONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS................................11 \nDEATH ........................................................................13 \nDERMATOLOGY/SKIN ...............................................14 \nENDOCRINE...............................................................17 \nGASTROINTESTINAL.................................................19 \nGROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT................................29 \nHEMORRHAGE/BLEEDING ....................................... 30 \nHEPATOBILIARY/PANCREAS ................................... 34 \nINFECTION................................................................. 35 \nLYMPHATICS ............................................................. 38 \nMETABOLIC/LABORATORY ...................................... 40 \nMUSCULOSKELETAL/SOFT TISSUE........................ 43 \nNEUROLOGY ............................................................. 47 \nOCULAR/VISUAL........................................................ 52 \nPAIN............................................................................ 55 \nPULMONARY/UPPER RESPIRATORY...................... 56 \nRENAL/GENITOURINARY.......................................... 60 \nSECONDARY MALIGNANCY..................................... 63 \nSEXUAL/REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION ..................... 64 \nSURGERY/INTRA-OPERATIVE INJURY ................... 66 \nSYNDROMES............................................................. 68 \nVASCULAR................................................................. 70 \n \nPage 149\n \nALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGY \nPage 1 of 1 \n \nGrade \nAdverse Event \nShort Name \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \nCTCAE v3.0  \n- 1 - \nMarch 31, 2003, Publish Date: August 9, 2006 \nAllergic reaction/ \nhypersensitivity  \n(including drug fever) \nAllergic reaction \nTransient flushing or \nrash;

When considering whether an adverse event has occurred, it is \nfirst necessary to classify the patient into one of two groups.
