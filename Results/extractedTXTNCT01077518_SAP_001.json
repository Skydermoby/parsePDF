The IRC assessment of response will be used for the primary analysis. The date of documented disease progression will be defined as the date of disease progression based on imaging data.  The date of death should be taken from the Record of Death page.  Death on study due to any cause will be included as an event for calculation of PFS.If there is no adequate baseline assessment, the subjects will be censored at their date of randomization.  Subjects without any adequate post-baseline assessments will be censored at the date of randomization.CONFIDENTIAL\nOMB157E2301\n43\nSubjects who progressed or died after an extended period without an adequate assessment \nwill be censored at their date of last adequate assessment prior to progression or death \neven if subsequent information is available regarding progression or death.  An adequate \nassessment is defined as an assessment where the IRC determined response is CR, PR, or \nSD. The date of response at that assessment will be used for censoring. As the assessment \nschedule may change through the course of the protocol, specific rules for identifying \nextended loss to follow-up or extended time without an adequate assessment are provided \nin Section 9.\nFor subjects who receive subsequent anti-cancer therapy, the following rules will apply:\n\uf0b7\nIf the start date of the anti-cancer therapy is partial (i.e. either missing the day but has \nthe month and year available or missing both day and month) the imputation rules \ndescribed in Section 9 will be applied.  No imputation will be made for completely \nmissing dates.\n\uf0b7\nIf anti-cancer therapy is started without documented disease progression or is started \nprior to documented disease progression, then PFS will be censored at the date of the \nlast adequate assessment that is no later than the date of initiation of anti-cancer \ntherapy (i.e. if an assessment occurs on the same day as the start of new anti-cancer \ntherapy the assessment will be used as it will be assumed the assessment occurred \nprior to the administration of new anti-cancer therapy).  The date of response at the \nlast adequate assessment will be used as the censoring value.\n\uf0b7\nIf a subject has only a baseline visit or does not have an adequate assessment that is \nnot later than the date of initiation of anti-cancer therapy, PFS will be censored at the \ndate of randomization.\nIf a subject has not progressed, has not died and has not started new-anti-cancer therapy, \nthen PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate assessment defined as an \nassessment where the IRC determined response is CR, PR, SD. The date of response will \nbe used as the censoring date.  \nA summary of the assignments for progression and censoring dates for PFS are specified \nin the following table.\nTable 1\nAssignments for Progression and Censoring Dates for PFS Analysis\nSituation\nDate \nof \nEvent \n(Progression/Death) \nor \nCensoring\nOutcome \nEvent (Progression/Death) \nor Censored\nNo (or inadequate) baseline \nassessment and the subject \nhas not died \nRandomization\nCensored\nNo post-baseline response Randomization\nCensored\nCONFIDENTIAL\nOMB157E2301\n44\nassessments and the subject \nhas not died\nProgression \ndocumented \nbetween scheduled visits\nDate \nof \nassessment \nof \nprogression\nEvent\nNo progression (or death)\nDate \nof \nlast \nadequate \nassessment of response1\nCensored\nNew anticancer treatment \nstarted (prior to documented \ndisease progression)2\nDate \nof \nlast \nadequate \nassessment of response1 (on \nor prior to starting anti-\ncancer therapy)\nCensored\nDeath \nbefore \nfirst \nPD \nassessment (or Death at \nbaseline or prior to any \nadequate assessments)\nDate of death\nEvent\nDeath \nbetween \nadequate \nassessment visits with no \nPD\nDate of death\nEvent\nDeath or progression after \nmore than one missed visit\nDate \nof \nlast \nadequate \nassessment \nof \nresponse \n(prior \nto \nmissed \nassessments)3\nCensored\n1An adequate assessment is defined as an assessment where the Independent Reveiwerer determined response is \nCR, PR, or SD. \n2If PD and new anti-cancer therapy occur on the same day, assume that progression was documented first (i.e. \noutcome is progression and the date is the date of the assessment of progression).  If anti-cancer therapy is started \nprior to any adequate assessments, censoring date should be the date of randomization.\n3For the rare case where a subject dies after more than 1 missed visit, and there are no post-baseline response \nassessments, the date of censoring will be defined as the randomization date.\nAn interim analysis of the primary endpoint, PFS confirmed by IRC, was planned to be\nperformed when approximately 2/3 of the initial number of PFS events confirmed by IRC \noccurred (172 PFS events by IRC).  The interim analysis for PFS was planned to be \nreviewed by an IDMC utilizing a significance level of 0.012 (for 172 events or adjusted \nas appropriate using an O\u2019Brien-Fleming spending function). The interim analysis of PFS \nwas conducted in the same manner as described for the primary analysis.  Details of the \ninterim analysis are also provided in the IDMC Charter. The IA occurred with 180 PFS \nevents by IRC and the actual alpha spent at IA was calculated to be 0.0144.\nThe primary analysis of PFS was planned to be based on a two-sided test with a \nsignificance level of 0.046. The primary analysis will be conducted at a significance level \nof 0.0483 (with 215 events) to maintain an overall study significance level of 0.05 (See \nSection 4.2 - Primary Analysis for details). The survival distributions will be estimated \nusing Kaplan-Meier survival curves and will be compared using a log-rank test stratified \nCONFIDENTIAL\nOMB157E2301\n45\nby randomization stratification factors. \nA Cox regression model stratified by \nrandomization stratification factors will be used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of PFS, \nalong with 95% CI based on the Wald test.\nIf there are a sufficient number of progressions or deaths, median PFS, first and third \nquartiles and 95% CI, will be estimated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method \n[Brookmeyer, 1982]. A figure and listing of progression-free survival time will also be \nprovided.\nA supplementary table showing the details of the number at risk, number of events, and \nnumber censored with the event time will also be produced.  \nA Cox regression model stratified by randomization stratification factors will be used as \nsupportive analysis and will include covariates for treatment and other baseline data \ndeemed appropriate including age, gender, race, Ann Arbor stage at screening, histology \nat screening, FLIPI score, and ECOG. The hazard ratio for treatment will represent the \nrisk of experiencing disease progression or death for \u2018ofatumumab+bendamustine\u2019 vs \n\u2018bendamustine\u2019.\nPFS will be evaluated for the ITT population.  If the ITT population and Per Protocol \npopulation differ by more than 10%, then PFS will also be evaluated for the Per-Protocol \npopulation to check the robustness of the result.\nSensitivity Analyses for PFS\nFive sensitivity analyses of PFS will be performed.  All sensitivity analyses will be \nperformed as described for the primary analysis of PFS.  If the primary efficacy analysis \nis not significant, the supportive and sensitivity analyses will be considered exploratory \nin nature. The sensitivity analyses are specified as follows:\n\uf0b7\nThe first sensitivity analysis will be conducted using the Investigator assessed \nresponse data.  \n\uf0b7\nThe second sensitivity analysis will be conducted using stratification based on the \neCRF data rather than stratification based on randomization details (see Section \n8.2).\n\uf0b7\nThe third sensitivitity will treat all progressions and deaths as events, regardless \nof whether they occurred after starting new anti-cancer therapy, including the \noptional ofatumumab for subjects in Arm B.\n\uf0b7\nThe fourth sensitivitity will treat all progressions and deaths as events, regardless \nof whether they occurred after starting new anti-cancer therapy or after 2 or more \nmissed scheduled assessments.\n",

If two assessments are obtained with the same time difference compared to the scheduled visit day, the assessment obtained prior to visit will be considered. The assessment at end of treatment visit will be considered as a scheduled time-point and in the time window definition if collected within 28 days of the last date of study treatment in the treatment phase, before crossover and before the start of any further anti-neoplastic therapies based on the definitions in table below. The same time window definitions will be used for assessing the compliance rates over time-points for the PRO scores.  A patient will be considered as eligible for a time-point assessment if the lower bound of the time window for that scheduled time point is within 28 days of the last date of study treatment in the treatment phase, before crossover and start date of new antineoplastic therapy.

This is done by multiplying \nthe sum of the subscale by the number of items in the subscale, then dividing by the \nnumber of items actually answered.  This can be done on the scoring guide or by using \nthe formula below:\nProrated subscale score = [Sum of item scores] x [N of items in subscale] \uf0b8[N of items \nanswered] \nWhen there are missing data, prorating by subscale in this way is acceptable as long as \nmore than 50% of the items were answered (e.g., a minimum of 4 of 7 items, 4 of 6 items, \netc).  The total score is then calculated as the sum of the un-weighted subscale scores.  \nThe FACT scale is considered to be an acceptable indicator of patient quality of life as \nlong as overall item response rate is greater than 80% (e.g., at least 22 of 27 FACT-G \nitems completed).  This is not to be confused with individual subscale item response rate, \nwhich allows a subscale score to be prorated for missing items if greater than 50% of \nitems are answered. In addition, a total score should only be calculated if ALL of the \ncomponent subscales have valid scores.\nThe analyses will be prepared by domain and will be summarized as follows:\nScore range: 0-116\nScore range: 0-108\nScore range: 0-168\n",
