Therefore, subjects enrolled in HPV-015 extension studies such as study HPV-062 cannot retain the HPV-015 subject number as is stated in the original protocol.

Cross-over vaccination will be offered to the subjects in the HPV-015 control group either by providing commercially available HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine or, if the vaccine is not licensed in the considered country or not licensed for the respective age group, through a separate clinical trial protocol. No vaccine will be administered in the current study. Rationale for the study and study designThis study will be conducted to allow for a safe exit from the HPV-015 study, ensuring that women who are at risk of developing a gynaecological lesion are medically monitored.Study subjects enrolled in the control arm of HPV-015 study may have been infected with the HPV types included in the vaccine during the study. All subjects may have been exposed to other high-risk HPV types. The current study will provide annual oncogenic HPV DNA testing and cervical cytology examination for a subset of HPV-015 subjects, who at their concluding HPV-015 study visit: \uf0b7displayed normal cervical cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV infection\uf0b7were pregnant so that no cervical sample could be collectedFor eligible subjects, the duration of this gynaecological follow-up will be up to a maximum of four years after the subjects\u2019 concluding visit of study HPV-015, since most cervical lesions develop within four years of infection and most oncogenic HPV infections are estimated to clear within two years [Trottier, 2008].If very few subjects are eligible for this study at one HPV-015 study site and if adequate gynaelogical follow-up care is available through the local health care system, these subjects may be referred to the local health care system, provided that ethical committee approval is obtained by the responsible investigator.The initial protocol of the HPV-015 trial included a three-year  CONFIDENTIAL113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)Report Final6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2714-MAR-2018 CONFIDENTIAL113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)Report Final24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d0510314-MAR-2018CONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n7\nefficacy follow-up.

Papillomaviruses, members of the papovaviridae family, \nare non-enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which can cause a variety of \nproliferative epithelial lesions in humans, including benign papillomas (warts) and \ninvasive cancer [Lowy, 2001; Zur Hausen, 2002]. \nCurrently, over 200 different types of HPVs have been recognized. Based on whether \nthey infect basal epithelial cells of the skin or the inner lining of tissues, they are \ncategorized as cutaneous or mucosal types [Burd, 2003]. At least 30 HPV types have \nbeen identified that infect the genital mucosa [Bosch, 1995]. HPV types are also \nclassified by their relative malignant potential into low-risk (LR) types (e.g. HPV-6, -11, \n-42, -43, and -44) and high-risk (HR) or oncogenic types (e.g. HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -34, \n-35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, -66, -68 and -70) [Burd, 2003]. Persistent infection \nwith an oncogenic HPV type has been clearly associated with the development of \ncervical cancer [Schiffman, 2005] and the association between cervical cancer and \ninfection with a HR HPV type is supported both by strong epidemiological evidence and \nthe detection of HPV DNA in up to 99.7% of cervical cancers worldwide [Schiffman,\n2005; Burd, 2003].\nThe distribution of HPV types varies within countries and between regions. HPV-16 and \nHPV-18 are the first and second most common types in all regions, with some variation \nin their distribution. HPV-16 is the most prevalent oncogenic HPV type and is present in \napproximately 54% of cervical tumor specimens worldwide. HPV-18 is associated with \napproximately 17% of cervical cancers, with the remaining tumors containing DNA from \nother oncogenic HPV types such as HPV-45 and -31. In combination, these two HPV \ntypes (HPV-16 and HPV-18) account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases \nglobally [Clifford, 2003].\nIn the general population, the estimated worldwide prevalence of HPV among women is \nbetween 5% and 40% [Baseman, 2005; Franco, 1999]. This wide variation reflects \nunderlying population characteristics (i.e. age range, geographic area, risk behaviours), \nthe use of different HPV DNA test methods, and also differences in the sexual activity of \nthe individuals studied. Assuming a conservative prevalence of 10% in developed \ncountries and 15% in developing countries, one author estimated 270 million HPV \ninfections amongst women globally [Bosch, 2002].\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals has developed a candidate prophylactic HPV \nvaccine based on L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18 formulated with AS04 (comprised \nof aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3] and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A [MPL]). \nThe vaccine contains HPV-16 and HPV-18 L1 VLP proteins produced using an \nexpression system based on the use of insect cells and recombinant Baculoviruses \nencoding L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18. The recombinant expressed proteins \n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n21\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n117\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n21\nundergo self-assembly to form empty viral capsids referred to as virus-like particles \n(VLPs) [Kirnbauer, 1992]. A study comparing different vaccine formulations \ndemonstrated that the highest antibody titres were induced by AS04-adjuvanted vaccine \nformulations [Giannini, 2006]. The AS04 adjuvant system is comprised of aluminium \nsalts (Al(OH)3) and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and is also used in \nother vaccines, including a hepatitis B vaccine licensed in Europe for use in \nhaemodialysis patients from the age of 15 years and above under the name Fendrix as \nwell as in an investigational HSV vaccine.\nTo date, more than 60 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above have \nreceived at least one dose of the HPV vaccine in clinical studies. A pooled safety analysis \nof data from almost 30 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above, of \nwhom 16 142 received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, showed the vaccine to be\ngenerally well tolerated in women of all ages [Descamps , 2009].\nResults of a large multinational phase III trial in women aged 15-25 years demonstrated \nhigh vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above \n(CIN2+), CIN1+ and persistent infection (6-month and 12-month definition) associated \nwith HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, significant vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ and CIN3+ \nirrespective of HPV type in the lesion as well as evidence of protection against HPV \ntypes 31, 33 and 45 [Paavonen, 2009]. This study also demonstrated the vaccine to be \ngenerally well tolerated in a broad range of women including those of different \nnationalities and ethnicities [Paavonen, 2007].\nA long-term efficacy follow-up study in women aged 15-25 years at the time of first \nvaccination demonstrated high vaccine efficacy against incident and persistent HPV-\n16/18 infections and their associated cytological cervical lesions up to 6.4 years of \nfollow-up [Gall, 2007; Harper, 2004; Harper, 2006; Harper, 2008]. When tested in young \nfemale adolescents, the vaccine induced immune responses that were approximately 2-\nfold higher than those elicited in women 15-25 years of age [Pedersen, 2007]. In women \nup to 55 years of age, the vaccine induced sustained HPV antibody levels up to Month 24\nafter the first vaccine dose and these antibody levels remained significantly higher than \nthose seen after natural infection [Schwarz, 2009].\nThe vaccine is marketed under the trade name Cervarix\u2122. The first major market in \nwhich the vaccine was licensed, is Australia, where licensure was obtained in May 2007 \nfor use in 10 to 45 year old females. In September 2007, the vaccine was licensed in the \nEuropean Union for the prevention of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN \ngrades 2 and 3) and cervical cancer causally related to HPV types 16 and 18. The present \nindication of the vaccine is for active immunization of girls and women from 10 years of \nage onwards for the prevention of persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and \nrelated clinical outcomes (cytological abnormalities, pre-cancerous lesions and cervical \ncancer) caused by oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. In October 2009, Cervarix was also\napproved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in \nfemales 10 through 25 years of age. The vaccine is currently licensed in over 100\ncountries worldwide.\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n22\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n118\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n22\nPlease refer to the current Investigator Brochure for a review of the pre-clinical and \nclinical studies, and the potential risks and benefits of the HPV-16/18 LI VLP AS04 \nvaccine.\n1.2.\nRationale for the study and study design\nThis study will be conducted to allow for a safe exit from the HPV-015 study, ensuring \nthat women who are at risk of developing a gynaecological lesion are medically \nmonitored.\nStudy subjects enrolled in the control arm of HPV-015 study may have been infected \nwith the HPV types included in the vaccine during the study. All subjects may have been \nexposed to other high-risk HPV types. \nThe current study will provide annual oncogenic HPV DNA testing and cervical cytology \nexamination for a subset of HPV-015 subjects, who at their concluding HPV-015 study \nvisit: \n\uf0b7\ndisplayed normal cervical cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV \ninfection\n\uf0b7\nwere pregnant so that no cervical sample could be collected \nFor eligible subjects, the duration of this gynaecological follow-up will be up to a\nmaximum of four years after the subjects\u2019 concluding HPV-015 study visit, since most \ncervical lesions develop within four years of infection and most oncogenic HPV \ninfections are estimated to clear within two years [Trottier, 2008].\nIf very few subjects are eligible for this study at one HPV-015 study site and if adequate \ngynaecological follow-up care is available through the local health care system, these \nsubjects may be referred to the local health care system, provided that ethical committee \napproval is obtained by the responsible investigator.\nThe initial protocol of the HPV-015 trial included a three year efficacy follow-up. The \nHPV-015 protocol amendment 3 and 4 extended the HPV-015 trial by one and up to a \nmaximum of three additional years, respectively.

For marketed medicinal products, this also includes \nfailure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. \nExamples of an AE include:\n\uf0b7\nSignificant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication \nunder study. \n\uf0b7\nExacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an \nincrease in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n40\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n136\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n40\n\uf0b7\nNew conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration \neven though they may have been present prior to the start of the study.\n\uf0b7\nSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.\n\uf0b7\nSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either \ninvestigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be \nreported as an AE/SAE).\n\uf0b7\nSigns, symptoms temporally associated with vaccine administration.\n\uf0b7\nSignificant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. \n8.1.2.\nExamples of an AE DO NOT include:\n\uf0b7\nMedical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that \nleads to the procedure is an AE.\n\uf0b7\nSituations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or \nconvenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).\n\uf0b7\nAnticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present \nor detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. \n\uf0b7\nFor therapeutic studies, the disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, \nsigns, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than \nexpected for the subject\u2019s condition.\nAEs may include pre- or post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-\nmandated procedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject\u2019s previous \ntherapeutic regimen).\n8.1.3.\nDefinition of a serious adverse event \nA serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:\na.\nResults in death.\nb.\nIs life-threatening.\nNB: The term \u2018life-threatening\u2019 in the definition of \u2018serious\u2019 refers to an event in \nwhich the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an \nevent, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe.\nc.\nRequires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation.\nNB: In general, hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the \nhospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have \nbeen appropriate in the physician\u2019s office or out-patient setting. Complications that \noccur during hospitalisation are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs \nhospitalisation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered \nserious. When in doubt as to whether \u2018hospitalisation\u2019 occurred or was necessary, the \nAE should be considered serious.\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n41\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n137\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n41\nHospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition (known/diagnosed \nprior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is NOT\nconsidered an AE.\nd.\nResults in disability/incapacity, or\nNB: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person\u2019s ability to \nconduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences \nof relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhoea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which \nmay interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial \ndisruption.\ne.\nIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.\nMedical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is \nappropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be \nimmediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the \nsubject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other \noutcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. \nExamples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an \nemergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions \nthat do not result in hospitalisation.\n8.1.4.\nSolicited adverse events\nNot applicable.\n8.1.5.\nClinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments \nqualifying as adverse events or serious adverse events \nAbnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis) or other \nabnormal assessments that are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant will \nbe recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE, as defined in Section \n8.1.1 or of a SAE, as defined in Section 8.1.3. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory \nfindings or other abnormal assessments that are detected during the study or are present at \nbaseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study will be reported as AEs \nor SAEs.

The assessment will be based on the investigator\u2019s clinical judgement.\nThe intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF or SAE Report screens as\napplicable, should be assigned to one of the following categories:\n1 (mild)\n=\nAn AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal \ndiscomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.\n2 (moderate)\n=\nAn AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with \nnormal everyday activities.\n3 (severe)\n=\nAn AE which prevents normal, everyday activities. In \nadults/adolescents, such an AE would, for example, prevent \nattendance at work/school and would necessitate the \nadministration of corrective therapy.\nAn AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade \n3 is a category utilised for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can \nbe assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as \u2018serious\u2019 when it meets one of the pre-\ndefined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.3.\n8.3.2.2.2.\nAssessment of causality\nThe investigator should assess the causality of each AE/SAE.

Alternative causes, such as natural history of the \nunderlying diseases, concomitant therapy and other risk factors will be considered and \ninvestigated.\nThere may be situations when an AE/SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal \ninformation to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However it is very \nimportant that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event \nprior to submission of the AE/SAE to GSK Biologicals.

Papillomaviruses, members of the papovaviridae family, \nare non-enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which can cause a variety of \nproliferative epithelial lesions in humans, including benign papillomas (warts) and \ninvasive cancer [Lowy, 2001; Zur Hausen, 2002]. \nCurrently, over 200 different types of HPVs have been recognized. Based on whether \nthey infect basal epithelial cells of the skin or the inner lining of tissues, they are \ncategorized as cutaneous or mucosal types [Burd, 2003]. At least 30 HPV types have \nbeen identified that infect the genital mucosa [Bosch, 1995]. HPV types are also \nclassified by their relative malignant potential into low-risk (LR) types (e.g. HPV-6, -11, \n-42, -43, and -44) and high-risk (HR) or oncogenic types (e.g. HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -34, \n-35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, -66, -68 and -70) [Burd, 2003]. Persistent infection \nwith an oncogenic HPV type has been clearly associated with the development of \ncervical cancer [Schiffman, 2005] and the association between cervical cancer and \ninfection with a HR HPV type is supported both by strong epidemiological evidence and \nthe detection of HPV DNA in up to 99.7% of cervical cancers worldwide [Schiffman,\n2005; Burd, 2003].\nThe distribution of HPV types varies within countries and between regions. HPV-16 and \nHPV-18 are the first and second most common types in all regions, with some variation \nin their distribution. HPV-16 is the most prevalent oncogenic HPV type and is present in \napproximately 54% of cervical tumor specimens worldwide. HPV-18 is associated with \napproximately 17% of cervical cancers, with the remaining tumors containing DNA from \nother oncogenic HPV types such as HPV-45 and -31. In combination, these two HPV \ntypes (HPV-16 and HPV-18) account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases \nglobally [Clifford, 2003].\nIn the general population, the estimated worldwide prevalence of HPV among women is \nbetween 5% and 40% [Baseman, 2005; Franco, 1999]. This wide variation reflects \nunderlying population characteristics (i.e. age range, geographic area, risk behaviours), \nthe use of different HPV DNA test methods, and also differences in the sexual activity of \nthe individuals studied. Assuming a conservative prevalence of 10% in developed \ncountries and 15% in developing countries, one author estimated 270 million HPV \ninfections amongst women globally [Bosch, 2002].\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals has developed a candidate prophylactic HPV \nvaccine based on L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18 formulated with AS04 (comprised \nof aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3] and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A [MPL]). \nThe vaccine contains HPV-16 and HPV-18 L1 VLP proteins produced using an \nexpression system based on the use of insect cells and recombinant Baculoviruses \nencoding L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18. The recombinant expressed proteins \n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n21\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n117\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n21\nundergo self-assembly to form empty viral capsids referred to as virus-like particles \n(VLPs) [Kirnbauer, 1992]. A study comparing different vaccine formulations \ndemonstrated that the highest antibody titres were induced by AS04-adjuvanted vaccine \nformulations [Giannini, 2006]. The AS04 adjuvant system is comprised of aluminium \nsalts (Al(OH)3) and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and is also used in \nother vaccines, including a hepatitis B vaccine licensed in Europe for use in \nhaemodialysis patients from the age of 15 years and above under the name Fendrix as \nwell as in an investigational HSV vaccine.\nTo date, more than 60 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above have \nreceived at least one dose of the HPV vaccine in clinical studies. A pooled safety analysis \nof data from almost 30 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above, of \nwhom 16 142 received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, showed the vaccine to be\ngenerally well tolerated in women of all ages [Descamps , 2009].\nResults of a large multinational phase III trial in women aged 15-25 years demonstrated \nhigh vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above \n(CIN2+), CIN1+ and persistent infection (6-month and 12-month definition) associated \nwith HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, significant vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ and CIN3+ \nirrespective of HPV type in the lesion as well as evidence of protection against HPV \ntypes 31, 33 and 45 [Paavonen, 2009]. This study also demonstrated the vaccine to be \ngenerally well tolerated in a broad range of women including those of different \nnationalities and ethnicities [Paavonen, 2007].\nA long-term efficacy follow-up study in women aged 15-25 years at the time of first \nvaccination demonstrated high vaccine efficacy against incident and persistent HPV-\n16/18 infections and their associated cytological cervical lesions up to 6.4 years of \nfollow-up [Gall, 2007; Harper, 2004; Harper, 2006; Harper, 2008]. When tested in young \nfemale adolescents, the vaccine induced immune responses that were approximately 2-\nfold higher than those elicited in women 15-25 years of age [Pedersen, 2007]. In women \nup to 55 years of age, the vaccine induced sustained HPV antibody levels up to Month 24\nafter the first vaccine dose and these antibody levels remained significantly higher than \nthose seen after natural infection [Schwarz, 2009].\nThe vaccine is marketed under the trade name Cervarix\u2122. The first major market in \nwhich the vaccine was licensed, is Australia, where licensure was obtained in May 2007 \nfor use in 10 to 45 year old females. In September 2007, the vaccine was licensed in the \nEuropean Union for the prevention of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN \ngrades 2 and 3) and cervical cancer causally related to HPV types 16 and 18. The present \nindication of the vaccine is for active immunization of girls and women from 10 years of \nage onwards for the prevention of persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and \nrelated clinical outcomes (cytological abnormalities, pre-cancerous lesions and cervical \ncancer) caused by oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. In October 2009, Cervarix was also\napproved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in \nfemales 10 through 25 years of age. The vaccine is currently licensed in over 100\ncountries worldwide.\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n22\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n118\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n22\nPlease refer to the current Investigator Brochure for a review of the pre-clinical and \nclinical studies, and the potential risks and benefits of the HPV-16/18 LI VLP AS04 \nvaccine.\n1.2.\nRationale for the study and study design\nThis study will be conducted to allow for a safe exit from the HPV-015 study, ensuring \nthat women who are at risk of developing a gynaecological lesion are medically \nmonitored.\nStudy subjects enrolled in the control arm of HPV-015 study may have been infected \nwith the HPV types included in the vaccine during the study. All subjects may have been \nexposed to other high-risk HPV types. \nThe current study will provide annual oncogenic HPV DNA testing and cervical cytology \nexamination for a subset of HPV-015 subjects, who at their concluding HPV-015 study \nvisit: \n\uf0b7\ndisplayed normal cervical cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV \ninfection\n\uf0b7\nwere pregnant so that no cervical sample could be collected \nFor eligible subjects, the duration of this gynaecological follow-up will be up to a\nmaximum of four years after the subjects\u2019 concluding HPV-015 study visit, since most \ncervical lesions develop within four years of infection and most oncogenic HPV \ninfections are estimated to clear within two years [Trottier, 2008].\nIf very few subjects are eligible for this study at one HPV-015 study site and if adequate \ngynaecological follow-up care is available through the local health care system, these \nsubjects may be referred to the local health care system, provided that ethical committee \napproval is obtained by the responsible investigator.\nThe initial protocol of the HPV-015 trial included a three year efficacy follow-up. The \nHPV-015 protocol amendment 3 and 4 extended the HPV-015 trial by one and up to a \nmaximum of three additional years, respectively. Subjects may however decide to \nconclude their participation in the HPV-015 study at Visit 9, Visit 11 or at the last study \nvisit in HPV-015 planned under protocol amendment 4.\nNote that subjects enrolled in this study can also concurrently participate in a GSK \nBiologicals study to receive cross-over vaccination.\nThis study is not intended to collect long-term efficacy, immunogenicity or safety follow-\nup data. Long-term data for GSK Biologicals\u2019 HPV vaccine will be obtained through \nother studies.\n1.2.1.\nRationale for the use of placebo\nNot applicable.\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n23\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n119\n14-MAR-2018\n",

Papillomaviruses, members of the papovaviridae family, \nare non-enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which can cause a variety of \nproliferative epithelial lesions in humans, including benign papillomas (warts) and \ninvasive cancer [Lowy, 2001; Zur Hausen, 2002]. \nCurrently, over 200 different types of HPVs have been recognized. Based on whether \nthey infect basal epithelial cells of the skin or the inner lining of tissues, they are \ncategorized as cutaneous or mucosal types [Burd, 2003]. At least 30 HPV types have \nbeen identified that infect the genital mucosa [Bosch, 1995]. HPV types are also \nclassified by their relative malignant potential into low-risk (LR) types (e.g. HPV-6, -11, \n-42, -43, and -44) and high-risk (HR) or oncogenic types (e.g. HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -34, \n-35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, -66, -68 and -70) [Burd, 2003]. Persistent infection \nwith an oncogenic HPV type has been clearly associated with the development of \ncervical cancer [Schiffman, 2005] and the association between cervical cancer and \ninfection with a HR HPV type is supported both by strong epidemiological evidence and \nthe detection of HPV DNA in up to 99.7% of cervical cancers worldwide [Schiffman,\n2005; Burd, 2003].\nThe distribution of HPV types varies within countries and between regions. HPV-16 and \nHPV-18 are the first and second most common types in all regions, with some variation \nin their distribution. HPV-16 is the most prevalent oncogenic HPV type and is present in \napproximately 54% of cervical tumor specimens worldwide. HPV-18 is associated with \napproximately 17% of cervical cancers, with the remaining tumors containing DNA from \nother oncogenic HPV types such as HPV-45 and -31. In combination, these two HPV \ntypes (HPV-16 and HPV-18) account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases \nglobally [Clifford, 2003].\nIn the general population, the estimated worldwide prevalence of HPV among women is \nbetween 5% and 40% [Baseman, 2005; Franco, 1999]. This wide variation reflects \nunderlying population characteristics (i.e. age range, geographic area, risk behaviours), \nthe use of different HPV DNA test methods, and also differences in the sexual activity of \nthe individuals studied. Assuming a conservative prevalence of 10% in developed \ncountries and 15% in developing countries, one author estimated 270 million HPV \ninfections amongst women globally [Bosch, 2002].\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals has developed a candidate prophylactic HPV \nvaccine based on L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18 formulated with AS04 (comprised \nof aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3] and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A [MPL]). \nThe vaccine contains HPV-16 and HPV-18 L1 VLP proteins produced using an \nexpression system based on the use of insect cells and recombinant Baculoviruses \nencoding L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18. The recombinant expressed proteins \n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n21\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n117\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n21\nundergo self-assembly to form empty viral capsids referred to as virus-like particles \n(VLPs) [Kirnbauer, 1992]. A study comparing different vaccine formulations \ndemonstrated that the highest antibody titres were induced by AS04-adjuvanted vaccine \nformulations [Giannini, 2006]. The AS04 adjuvant system is comprised of aluminium \nsalts (Al(OH)3) and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and is also used in \nother vaccines, including a hepatitis B vaccine licensed in Europe for use in \nhaemodialysis patients from the age of 15 years and above under the name Fendrix as \nwell as in an investigational HSV vaccine.\nTo date, more than 60 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above have \nreceived at least one dose of the HPV vaccine in clinical studies. A pooled safety analysis \nof data from almost 30 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above, of \nwhom 16 142 received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, showed the vaccine to be\ngenerally well tolerated in women of all ages [Descamps , 2009].\nResults of a large multinational phase III trial in women aged 15-25 years demonstrated \nhigh vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above \n(CIN2+), CIN1+ and persistent infection (6-month and 12-month definition) associated \nwith HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, significant vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ and CIN3+ \nirrespective of HPV type in the lesion as well as evidence of protection against HPV \ntypes 31, 33 and 45 [Paavonen, 2009]. This study also demonstrated the vaccine to be \ngenerally well tolerated in a broad range of women including those of different \nnationalities and ethnicities [Paavonen, 2007].\nA long-term efficacy follow-up study in women aged 15-25 years at the time of first \nvaccination demonstrated high vaccine efficacy against incident and persistent HPV-\n16/18 infections and their associated cytological cervical lesions up to 6.4 years of \nfollow-up [Gall, 2007; Harper, 2004; Harper, 2006; Harper, 2008]. When tested in young \nfemale adolescents, the vaccine induced immune responses that were approximately 2-\nfold higher than those elicited in women 15-25 years of age [Pedersen, 2007]. In women \nup to 55 years of age, the vaccine induced sustained HPV antibody levels up to Month 24\nafter the first vaccine dose and these antibody levels remained significantly higher than \nthose seen after natural infection [Schwarz, 2009].\nThe vaccine is marketed under the trade name Cervarix\u2122. The first major market in \nwhich the vaccine was licensed, is Australia, where licensure was obtained in May 2007 \nfor use in 10 to 45 year old females. In September 2007, the vaccine was licensed in the \nEuropean Union for the prevention of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN \ngrades 2 and 3) and cervical cancer causally related to HPV types 16 and 18. The present \nindication of the vaccine is for active immunization of girls and women from 10 years of \nage onwards for the prevention of persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and \nrelated clinical outcomes (cytological abnormalities, pre-cancerous lesions and cervical \ncancer) caused by oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. In October 2009, Cervarix was also\napproved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in \nfemales 10 through 25 years of age. The vaccine is currently licensed in over 100\ncountries worldwide.\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n22\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n118\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n22\nPlease refer to the current Investigator Brochure for a review of the pre-clinical and \nclinical studies, and the potential risks and benefits of the HPV-16/18 LI VLP AS04 \nvaccine.\n1.2.\nRationale for the study and study design\nThis study will be conducted to allow for a safe exit from the HPV-015 study, ensuring \nthat women who are at risk of developing a gynaecological lesion are medically \nmonitored.\nStudy subjects enrolled in the control arm of HPV-015 study may have been infected \nwith the HPV types included in the vaccine during the study.

For marketed medicinal products, this also includes \nfailure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. \nExamples of an AE include:\n\uf0b7\nSignificant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication \nunder study. \n\uf0b7\nExacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an \nincrease in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n6ffc58c940707579d24ed26cf53eced2\n40\n14-MAR-2018\n \nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nReport Final\n24b28ed5a92fffa900a7e85ab771aed0745d9d05\n136\n14-MAR-2018\nCONFIDENTIAL\n113617 (HPV-062 EXT:015)\nAdministrative Change 1\n18-AUG-2010\n40\n\uf0b7\nNew conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration \neven though they may have been present prior to the start of the study.\n\uf0b7\nSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.\n\uf0b7\nSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either \ninvestigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be \nreported as an AE/SAE).\n\uf0b7\nSigns, symptoms temporally associated with vaccine administration.\n\uf0b7\nSignificant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. \n8.1.2.\nExamples of an AE DO NOT include:\n\uf0b7\nMedical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that \nleads to the procedure is an AE.\n\uf0b7\nSituations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or \nconvenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).\n\uf0b7\nAnticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present \nor detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. \n\uf0b7\nFor therapeutic studies, the disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, \nsigns, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than \nexpected for the subject\u2019s condition.\nAEs may include pre- or post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-\nmandated procedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject\u2019s previous \ntherapeutic regimen).\n8.1.3.\nDefinition of a serious adverse event \nA serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:\na.\nResults in death.\nb.\nIs life-threatening.\nNB: The term \u2018life-threatening\u2019 in the definition of \u2018serious\u2019 refers to an event in \nwhich the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an \nevent, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe.\nc.\nRequires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation.\nNB: In general, hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the \nhospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have \nbeen appropriate in the physician\u2019s office or out-patient setting. Complications that \noccur during hospitalisation are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs \nhospitalisation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered \nserious.

In such cases, the diagnosis should be \ndocumented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.\n8.3.2.2.\nAssessment of adverse events\n8.3.2.2.1.\nAssessment of intensity\nIntensity of the following AEs will be assessed as described:\nThe investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the \nevent for all other AEs, i.e. unsolicited symptoms, including SAEs reported during the \nstudy. The assessment will be based on the investigator\u2019s clinical judgement.\nThe intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF or SAE Report screens as\napplicable, should be assigned to one of the following categories:\n1 (mild)\n=\nAn AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal \ndiscomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.\n2 (moderate)\n=\nAn AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with \nnormal everyday activities.\n3 (severe)\n=\nAn AE which prevents normal, everyday activities. In \nadults/adolescents, such an AE would, for example, prevent \nattendance at work/school and would necessitate the \nadministration of corrective therapy.\nAn AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade \n3 is a category utilised for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can \nbe assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as \u2018serious\u2019 when it meets one of the pre-\ndefined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.3.\n8.3.2.2.2.\nAssessment of causality\nThe investigator should assess the causality of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use \nclinical judgement to determine the relationship of AEs/SAEs to study procedures or to \nGSK concomitant medication.

GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility to promptly notify, \nas appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the \nsafety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the \ninvestigator to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations \nand ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other subjects are met.\nInvestigator safety reports are prepared according to the current GSK policy and are \nforwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator safety report is prepared for a \nSAE(s) that is both attributable to the investigational product and unexpected. The \npurpose of the report is to fulfil specific regulatory and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) \nrequirements, regarding the product under investigation.\n8.4.3.\nCompletion and transmission of SAEs reports to GSK Biologicals\nOnce an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the \ninvestigator will complete and submit the information in the SAE screens in eCRF within \n24 hours. The SAE screens in eCRF will always be completed as thoroughly as possible \nwith all available details of the event and will be submitted by the investigator. If the \ninvestigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to \nreceive additional information before notifying GSK of the event and completing the \nSAE screens in eCRF.

A study comparing different vaccine formulations \ndemonstrated that the highest antibody titres were induced by AS04-adjuvanted vaccine \nformulations [Giannini, 2006]. The AS04 adjuvant system is comprised of aluminium \nsalts (Al(OH)3) and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and is also used in \nother vaccines, including a hepatitis B vaccine licensed in Europe for use in \nhaemodialysis patients from the age of 15 years and above under the name Fendrix as \nwell as in an investigational HSV vaccine.\nTo date, more than 60 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above have \nreceived at least one dose of the HPV vaccine in clinical studies. A pooled safety analysis \nof data from almost 30 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above, of \nwhom 16 142 received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, showed the vaccine to be\ngenerally well tolerated in women of all ages [Descamps , 2009].\nResults of a large multinational phase III trial in women aged 15-25 years demonstrated \nhigh vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above \n(CIN2+), CIN1+ and persistent infection (6-month and 12-month definition) associated \nwith HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, significant vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ and CIN3+ \nirrespective of HPV type in the lesion as well as evidence of protection against HPV \ntypes 31, 33 and 45 [Paavonen, 2009]. This study also demonstrated the vaccine to be \ngenerally well tolerated in a broad range of women including those of different \nnationalities and ethnicities [Paavonen, 2007].\nA long-term efficacy follow-up study in women aged 15-25 years at the time of first \nvaccination demonstrated high vaccine efficacy against incident and persistent HPV-\n16/18 infections and their associated cytological cervical lesions up to 6.4 years of \nfollow-up [Gall, 2007; Harper, 2004; Harper, 2006; Harper, 2008]. When tested in young \nfemale adolescents, the vaccine induced immune responses that were approximately 2-\nfold higher than those elicited in women 15-25 years of age [Pedersen, 2007]. In women \nup to 55 years of age, the vaccine induced sustained HPV antibody levels up to Month 24\nafter the first vaccine dose and these antibody levels remained significantly higher than \nthose seen after natural infection [Schwarz, 2009].\nThe vaccine is marketed under the trade name Cervarix\u2122. The first major market in \nwhich the vaccine was licensed, is Australia, where licensure was obtained in May 2007 \nfor use in 10 to 45 year old females. In September 2007, the vaccine was licensed in the \nEuropean Union for the prevention of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN \ngrades 2 and 3) and cervical cancer causally related to HPV types 16 and 18. The present \nindication of the vaccine is for active immunization of girls and women from 10 years of \nage onwards for the prevention of persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and \nrelated clinical outcomes (cytological abnormalities, pre-cancerous lesions and cervical \ncancer) caused by oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. In October 2009, Cervarix was also\napproved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in \nfemales 10 through 25 years of age.

Refer to the module of clinical trial supplies in the SPM.\n5.9.4.1.\nCytology\nCervical cytology will be performed using the ThinPrep\u00ae PapTest (Cytyc Corporation, \nBoxborough, MA, USA), by Quest Diagnostics (Teterboro, NJ, US), or another GSK \ndesignated laboratory. Cervical cells for ThinPrep\u00ae cytology at scheduled 12-month \ninterval visits will be collected using the sampling device provided and rinsed into a \ncollection vial containing PreservCyt\u00ae medium (provided by sponsor GSK Biologicals \nor Quest Diagnostics).\n(Note, also amended in Appendix A)\n5.9.4.2.\nHPV DNA Testing by Hybrid Capture 2II (HC2HCII)\nAfter ThinPrep\u00ae cytology slides have been prepared, residual PreservCyt\u00ae specimens on \nslides for all samples read as normal or ASCUS will be tested for HPV DNA. Testing \nwill be done by Quest Diagnostics (Teterboro, NJ, US), or another GSK designated \nlaboratory using the Hybrid Capture\u00ae 2II test (HC2HCII; Digene Corp., Gaithersburg, \nMD, USA). Probe B will be used and is designed to detect infections with one of 13 \noncogenic HPV types (HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68) \n[Vernick 2003, Digene Corporation 2002].
