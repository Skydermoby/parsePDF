                "Content": "Amendment rationale\uf0b7The rationale for this amendment is to reflect the changes in the Core protocol (CZOL446H2337) v05 which has been amended  to provide a Risk Benefit statement (Section 3.6), and allow more countries to apply the contraceptive wording originally provided for UK sites only.\uf0b7The introduction (Section 1) has been revised with more recent references that reflect the increase in knowledge of childhood osteoporosis since the protocol was first proposed.  \uf0b7The investigational plan (Section 3) and statistical sections (Section 9) have been clarified. \uf0b7In addition, the DMC concerns regarding potential for transient symptomatic hypocalcemia after first infusion are addressed by adding additional calcium supplementation at the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for age in Table 5-1 for up to 10 days around time of infusion (in line with Institutional clinical practice guidelines). \uf0b7Table 5-1 has been revised in line with the current minimum RDAs for vitamin D and calcium from the Institute of Medicine. \uf0b7Visit 9 for Group 1 is now defined as up to 10 months after Visit 5 (month 6) of the Core study, to allow patients who are deteriorating at the time of the second infusion during the Core study to enter the Extension study rather than be treated off-label.\uf0b7This amendment includes clarification of the list of eligible medical conditions other than chronic rheumatologic conditions or inflammatory bowel disease or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) already specified previously. These additional conditions are listed in Appendix 6 and the exclusion criteria for Group 2 have been revised to address these as follows: \uf0b7Due to the inclusion of some of these additional medical conditions, e.g. nephrotic syndrome, the exclusion criterion of renal impairment previously defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening has been increased to normal renal function defined as < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the Schwartz formula at Visit 8 (Group 1) or Visit 8A (Group 2). \uf0b7Schwartz formula has been added under Section 6.5.4.2\uf0b7In addition \u2018serious renal disease\u2019 in DMD has been removed as this is included under the GFR exclusion criterion. \uf0b7In DMD patients, chronic muscle breakdown results in elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (frequently higher than 10 fold); hence total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) have been added as additional markers to detect any potential liver toxicity.Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 11\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 03) clean\nProtocol No. CZOL446H2337E1\n\uf0b7\nThe exclusion criterion \u2018symptomatic cardiac abnormality\u2019 in DMD has been \nredefined because other conditions or concomitant medications, including \nglucocorticoids can contribute to cardiac disease: Uncontrolled symptoms of \ncardiac failure or arrhythmia. \n\uf0b7\nSerum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations have been revised to the currently \naccepted definition of normal i.e. < 20 ng/mL or < 50 nmol/L at Visit 8A for \nGroup 2. \n\uf0b7\nThe blood volume required (Appendix 7) for the analysis of specialized bone \nmarkers has been reduced from 8.5 mL to 3 mL. \n\uf0b7\nThe local serum creatinine before the second infusion of zoledronic acid has been \nremoved because of the need for normal renal function as an eligibility criterion. Renal \nfunction is reviewed centrally before and 10 days after each infusion.\n\uf0b7\nInconsistencies have been corrected within the protocol and across supporting documents \nespecially with respect to Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event reporting in Group 2 and \ncentral laboratory analyses. \n\uf0b7\nIn this 12 month study, visit windows have been removed and replaced with a requirement \nto perform the visit as close to the designated day as possible. For Group 2 only, the time \nbetween Visit 8A and Visit 9 should be as close to 28 days as possible, but cannot be \nlonger than 8 weeks. \nThe latest Novartis protocol template has been used to aid the reader in navigating the \nprotocol and more some procedures have been revised in line with our current processes.\nStatus of the study as of 10-May-2016:\nTwelve (12) patients have been enrolled onto this study, all were enrolled into Group 1; the \nproposed changes will have no impact on the interpretation of the data.\nChanges to the protocol\nChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown by track changes in the track changes \nversion of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions, and red underlined for \ninsertion.\nA copy of this amended protocol will be sent to the Institutional Review Board \n(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committee (IECs) and Health Authorities.\nThe changes herein affect the Informed Consent. Sites are required to update and submit for \napproval a revised Informed Consent that takes into account the changes described in this \nprotocol amendment.\nSummary of previous amendments:\nAmendment 2\nThe rationale for this amendment (dated 15-Jan-2014) was to reflect the changes in the Core \n(CZOL446H2337) protocol v04 which extended the study population to include subjects with \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 12\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 03) clean\nProtocol No. CZOL446H2337E1\nunderlying conditions other than chronic inflammatory disorders e.g. Duchenne muscular \ndystrophy (DMD).\n\uf0b7\nInclude (Group 2): patients not eligible to enroll into the Core study because of clinically \nsignificant back pain (significant symptoms) from vertebral fracture and the preexisting \nclinical care at the Investigator\u2019s site is to treat this type of patient with a bisphosphonate. \nTherefore two Baselines are used in the study:\n\uf0b7\nBaseline 1: First visit of the Core for Group 1\n\uf0b7\nBaseline 2: First visit of the Extension for Group 2.\n\uf0b7\nAlign with the Core study changes in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:\n\uf0b7\nRelax the LS BMD Z-score inclusion criteria from -1.0 to -0.5 or worse.\n\uf0b7\nModify the exclusion criteria of patients with any prior use of osteoporosis/bone \nmodifying therapy. Bisphosphonates and sodium fluoride will be kept in the exclusion \ncriteria. Calcitonin, calcitriol, SERMS, LHRH agonists, Growth Hormone and \nmedroxyprogesterone will be taken out from the exclusion criteria\n\uf0b7\nModify the exclusion criteria of patients with any prior use of osteoporosis/bone \nmodifying therapy and to allow non-ambulatory patients who require wheelchair \nassistance for mobility to enter the study.\n\uf0b7\nAdd exclusion criteria for history of serious renal disease and symptomatic cardiac \ninvolvement in DMD patients.\n\uf0b7\nAlign with the Core study changes in the assessments by adding the following:\n\uf0b7\nSerum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentration at Month 12 of the Extension.\n\uf0b7\nEliminated 24-hours and 48-hours post-first dose local serum ionized calcium \nmeasurements.\nAmendment 1\nThis amendment (dated 29-Nov-2012) applied to United Kingdom (UK) sites only, regarding \ncontraception and pregnancy in female patients of child bearing potential.\nNovartisConfidentialPage 13Amended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 03) cleanProtocol No. CZOL446H2337E1",

Furthermore, BMD is greatly \ninfluenced by sex steroids, and puberty can be delayed in the presence of GC which can also \nresult in short stature which may be offset by the use of bisphosphonates (Glorieux et al 1998). \nRisks\nKnown risks of zoledronic acid\nSince this protocol was first written in 2010, there have been more publications on the \npotential use of bisphosphonates in children with kidney diseases including nephrotic \nsyndrome (Gruppen et al 2013, Sbrocchi et al 2011). \nZoledronic acid is concentrated and excreted via the kidney and, like other bisphosphonates, \nhas the potential to produce renal injury. Thus, care should be taken when administering the \ncompound to patients with renal insufficiency. Although case reports have been published in \nadults regarding the nephrotoxicity of zoledronic acid with an incidence of acute kidney \ninjury (AKI) between 9% and 13%, bisphosphonate-induced AKI in children remains \nundocumented (Patzer 2008). \n\uf0b7\nIn this protocol, patients are excluded if they have an estimated glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. In addition patients considered for Group 2 who have \nnephrotic syndrome with osteoporosis, who do not meet this exclusion criterion, have \nbeen stable for 3 months prior to enrollment, and meet the remaining eligibility criteria,\ncan be considered for this study. \nPost-infusion acute phase reactions are more common after the first infusion and can include \npyrexia, muscle and joint pain, \n\uf0b7\nTo reduce the risk of these reactions, children will be instructed to eat and drink as usual, \nNSAIDs or acetaminophen (paracetamol) will be prescribed and an anti-emetic may be \nprovided to reduce the risk of symptomatic hypocalcemia if the child develops nausea or \nstarts to vomit. Further calcium supplements will be provided for up to 10 days at the time \nof infusion and parent/legal guardian instructions provided on the signs to watch for as \nwell as an emergency number, if needed.\nA rare risk in patients who receive bisphosphonates is osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). This \ncondition has been reported in cancer patients whose complex treatment regimens include \nhigher doses and frequencies of bisphosphonates, typically administered with other treatments \nsuch as radiation, chemotherapy and GCs. To date, ONJ has not been reported in the literature \nin children or adolescents who have received bisphosphonates. Based on available evidence, a \ncausal relationship between ONJ and bisphosphonates, including ZOL, has not been \nestablished. \n\uf0b7\nIn this study a lower dose and short duration of zoledronic acid is used than has been \nreported in cases of ONJ in adults, and all children will have an examination of their oral \ncavity during the study and referred to a dentist if necessary.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 24\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 03) clean\nProtocol No. CZOL446H2337E1\nPotential risks of zoledronic acid in a pediatric population\nBased on the results from animal studies showing inhibition of bone calcification by first \ngeneration bisphosphonates (Mashiba et al 2000), there are theoretical concerns about \nnegative effects on growth in children. In growing children, each bisphosphonate treatment \ncycle leads to the accumulation of a thin band of mineralized tissue at the interface between \ngrowth plate and metaphysis which is evident as a metaphyseal line on the radiograph (Land \net al 2006a). These lines represent persistent calcified cartilage in the horizontal trabeculae \nwhich later remodels into secondary bone. This interface between weaker bone and stronger \nbisphosphonate-treated bone could represent a site for potential fracture. However, in clinical \ntrials with i.v. bisphosphonates, linear growth in children and adolescents has not been \nobserved to be negatively impacted with no observed increase in fracture. To the contrary, \ncyclical i.v. treatment with pamidronate has been shown to be beneficial in children with \nsevere forms of OI (Glorieux et al 1998). \n\uf0b7\nTo investigate this potential risk, all subjects will have DXA examination at 6 and 12 \nmonths and in the event of clinical worsening or diagnosis of new fracture, an X-ray will \nbe performed.\nAnother concern in children is effects on the reproductive organs. The animal reproduction \nstudies of zoledronic acid are described in [Section 4.3.5 of the Investigator\u2019s Brochure].\nTeratogenicity was observed in the rat, but not the rabbit when treatment during the perinatal \nperiod resulted in delayed parturition likely resulting from the calcium lowering effect of the \ncompound outside of bone, which negatively affects uterine contraction. There were no \neffects reported in males. \n\uf0b7\nConsequently this protocol requires contraception in all girls who are pubertal and may \nbecome pregnant and in some countries additional pregnancy checks will be made.\nThere are potential concerns regarding the i.v. infusion in children. Apart from the potential \nrisks at the infusion site of pain, infection, phlebitis, hematoma and extravasation, the infusion \nmay also cause fluid overload if the rate is too high and this can result in hypertension, heart \nfailure or pulmonary edema. Additional risks of the infusion can include electrolyte imbalance \nand embolism.\n\uf0b7\nThe infusion is administered in a hospital or clinic by staff experienced in administering \ni.v. infusions to children. The infusion line is flushed with saline before and after \nadministration and the infusion given over at least 30 minutes e.g. in a 25 kg child, \n100 mL may be administered over one hour at a rate of 5 mL/minute.\nProtocol procedures: blood draws and radiology\nThe number of blood draws and frequency of hospital visits in this protocol is within the usual \nlimit of clinical practice for children with these serious underlying diseases. The radiation \nexposure is increased over routine clinical practice, but within the limits for children who \nhave suffered a fracture and no greater than the exposure during a transatlantic flight. Repeat \nblood draws and X-rays/DXA will only be requested when absolutely necessary i.e. safety, \nbaseline or end-of-study visits.\nIn summary, the risks to the children and adolescents in this trial will be minimized by \ncompliance with the eligibility criteria and study procedures, particularly adequate hydration \nat the time of the infusion, adherence to a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, regular renal \n",
