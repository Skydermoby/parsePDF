                "Title": "Amendment 9 (13-Apr-2017)",
                "Content": " Amendment rationale The purpose of amendment 9 is to revise the total number of events required for the primary analysis of the primary end point PFS.  The primary analysis was planned after reaching 259 PFS events as determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).  Based on the current status of the study and PFS event count by IRC, it is highly unlikely that the 259 PFS events will be achieved. The study has been ongoing since September 2010 when the first patient was enrolled and the study sponsorship changed in February 2016 from GSK to Novartis (Amendment 8, dated18Mar2016). Per protocol, Interim Analysis for efficacy and futility and IDMC review occurred (22Feb2016) after 180 PFS events by IRC were reached (31Oct2015). IDMC recommended to continue the study without changes. The interim analysis of PFS wasperformed by an independent Statistical Data Analysis Centre. As per IDMC charter, unblinded results were not communicated to the sponsor in order to maintain the integrity of the trial. The protocol defined full recruitment of 346 patients was achieved as of 16May2016.As of 31Jan2017, 203 PFS events by IRC were reported with 56 events remaining to achieve the planned 259 events. Furthermore, there were approximately 58 patients at risk of having a future event at that time, so it was highly unlikely that 259 PFS events would ever be reached. The overall rate of discontinuation before PFS event was 21% (n=71 out of 346), due to reasons such as withdrawal from study, start of new anti-cancer therapy and lost to follow-up. This was higher than the protocol assumed discontinuation rate of 12%.This amendment defines an updated targeted number of PFS events by IRC of approximately 215 for the primary analysis. This number of events was selected as it is achievable in a timely manner (considering the current rate of PFS events), and it allows to keep an appropriate level of power (84%) to demonstrate the targeted treatment effect. The critical value for the primary analysis has been updated using the targeted number of events at the cut-off date, and considering the \u03b1-level spent at interim analysis, in order to achieve a cumulative type I error smaller than 5%.Sixty nine percent of enrolled patients in this study have the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (FL) and 31% have other histological subtypes of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).Prior experience with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab in the GADOLIN trial with very similar trial design  showed that the efficacy of this drug was demonstrated in the FL sub-type only (80% of the trial population), which led to the approval of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine in that particular subset of iNHL patients only. Since the current protocol does not include an analysis of efficacy per histological subtypes (i.e. in FL and non-FL patients) and based on the above considerations, secondary objectives are added in order to formally compare efficacy in the FL patients between treatment arms (i.e. \u201cinferential secondary endpoints\u201d). Efficacy analyses will also be performed in the non-FL patients to allow accurate interpretation of the results. Consequently, the hierarchical testing procedure is updated to include PFS, ORR and OS in the FL patients, in addition to PFS, ORR and OS in all patients. Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 3\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nThe initial testing plan for inferential secondary endpoints (i.e. PFS according to IRC \nassessment in FL patients, overall survival and ORR in overall patients and in FL patients) has \nbeen updated to incorporate the additional objectives \n \n. The updated approach allows to control the type I error \nprobability by using a separate alpha spending function for each inferential secondary \nendpoint, independent of the one used for the primary efficacy analysis of PFS.\nA total of 173 patients were randomized to Arm B (Bendamustine monotherapy). Over time, \nthere were inconsistencies in the protocol amendments regarding the need for collection of \nHACA samples for Arm B patients at Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1). Despite these inconsistencies, \nthe general interpretation was that samples should be collected at C1D1, which resulted in \ncollection of approximately 83% of Arm B (n=143 of total 173) HACA samples at that time \npoint. This amendment clarifies HACA sample collection for Arm B patients stating that \nHACA samples should be collected at C1D1 for all patients in the trial.\nThe amendment also clarifies timing of primary and final analysis. Primary analysis will take \nplace after approximately 215 PFS events by IRC are achieved and final analysis will take \nplace after all patients have completed 5 year follow up or discontinued earlier.\nThis amendment replaces IRR (Independent Radiology Review) with IRC (Independent \nReview Committee which includes radiology and Oncology review) to correctly reflect the \nreview of PFS events being done. \nChanges to the protocol\nChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the \nprotocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underline for insertions.\nSponsor Information Page: Medical lead contact information changed to reflect current \nmedical lead information\nProtocol Summary: updated to add the Amendment 9 changes related to the revised number of \nevents needed for the primary PFS analysis.

Interim analysis section updated to clearly \ndefine IRC.\nIndependent Radiology (IRR) changed to Independent Review Committee (IRC) throughout\nthe document where applicable.\nSummary of previous amendments was added.\nUpdated the list of abbreviations to add IRC.\nFor clarity, the term \u201cprimary analysis\u201d is used throughout the document, to replace the \nprevious term of \u201cfinal analysis\u201d, for the analysis which is planned when approximately 215 \nPFS events by IRC occurs. Additionally, in Section 8.2, the definition of \u201cfinal analysis\u201d has \nbeen added for the analysis to be conducted at the end of study.\nSection 2: Secondary objectives are added for patients with follicular lymphoma. \nNovartisConfidentialPage 4Amended Protocol Version 11 CleanProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918Section 3.1: Added the revised number of PFS events needed for the primary analysis.Section 6.3.3: Updated to clarify collection of HACA samples.

                "Content": "RationalePatients with indolent lymphomas have a variable course. Most present with stage III or IV disease and eventually require treatment.Indolent lymphomas are sensitive to alkylating agents and to combinations with biologics, but subsequently follow a pattern of multiple relapses and progressively shorter periods of remission between relapses. Options are limited for those who no longer respond to rituximab-containing regimens.Bendamustine is a synthetic nitrogen mustard compound that has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and has activity in the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) that has progressed during or within 6 months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab\u2013containing regimen [Treanda Prescribing Information , 2010; Kahl, 2010; Friedberg, 2008].  Biologics have demonstrated enhanced efficacy when added to chemotherapeutic combinations in the frontline treatment for indolent NHL. Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 mAb shown to have monotherapy activity in a Phase I/II study in relapsed follicular lymphoma following rituximab-containing therapy.  The combination of ofatumumab and bendamustine may provide additional clinical benefit to those who no longer respond to rituximab or rituximab-containing regimens.  ",

In addition, secondary objectives are added in order to formally compare efficacy in the FL patients between treatment arms (i.e. \u201cinferential secondary endpoints\u201d). ",

Ofatumumab will be given on Day 1 \nof each cycle of bendamustine as long as subjects in Arm A receive bendamustine.  Once \nsubjects in Arm A complete bendamustine therapy, the remaining doses of ofatumumab will \nbe given monthly (q28 days) until all 12 doses are completed.\nOr\nArm B:  Bendamustine (120 mg/m2 Days 1 and 2, every 21 days, up to 8 cycles). \nSubjects in Arm A and Arm B who cannot complete 8 cycles of therapy with bendamustine \nmust still have all planned Day 1 assessments (Visits 1-20) done including scheduled CT \nscans and assessments that occur on Days 84, 168, and 252.\nAt the discretion of the investigator, ofatumumab will be offered to those with progressive \ndisease (PD) in Arm B.  If these subjects select ofatumumab, therapy must begin \uf0a3120 days \nfollowing PD.  PD must be verified by CT scan.  This CT scan must be confirmed by an \nindependent radiologist before ofatumumab therapy begins.  Subjects will receive \nofatumumab (1000 mg for the first infusion on Week 1 followed by 2000 mg, one infusion \nevery week for a total of 3 infusions (Weeks 2-4) followed by 2000 mg, one infusion every\nmonth for 8 infusions, total: 12 doses).\nEligible subjects will be stratified by type of last prior rituximab therapy: rituximab plus \nchemotherapy or rituximab alone (either in maintenance or monotherapy) and by prior \nexposure to bendamustine: exposed or not exposed.\nScreening assessments include physical exam, vital signs, biochemistry, and blood tests.  \nBlood samples (hematology and biochemistry including human anti-human antibodies, human \nanti-chimeric antibodies), flow cytometry and immunoglobulin assessments, vital signs are \ntaken throughout the treatment phase.  Follow-up assessments begin on Day 336 post \nrandomization (3 months after Day 252), then according to Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 time \nand events tables.  In the event of PD, Survival Follow-Up visits begin 2 months after PD is \nconfirmed by CT scan.  A bone marrow examination is required to confirm Complete \nRemission (CR) when a subject fulfills the complete response criteria, based on the Revised \nResponse Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma definition of a CR if the subject had bone \nmarrow involvement at baseline.  CT imaging is required for confirmation of all responses \n(CR, PR, SD, PD).  During this study, CT imaging of the neck (when lesion is palpable), \nthorax, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed at baseline, and on Days 84, 168, and 252 (+7 \ndays), regardless of the number of completed cycles of therapy in Arm A and Arm B.\nA total of 259 events in a sample size of 304 evaluable subjects (152 subjects per arm) are \nneeded for the study to have a 90% power to detect a 50% improvement in PFS (PFS) \nbetween study arms.  Assuming a dropout rate of 12%, the total sample size randomized for \nboth arms combined will be 346 subjects, with approximate study duration of 77 months.  \nAssuming a screening failure rate of 15%, the total number of subjects screened will be \napproximately 408.\nNovartisConfidentialPage 22Amended Protocol Version 11 CleanProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918Per Amendment 9, the primary analysis will be performed after approximately 215 PFS events by IRC have been observed.  This targeted number of 215 PFS events by IRC for the primary analysis was calculated in order to achieve a cumulative power of 84% to detect a 50% improvement in PFS between study arms.

Based on the simulations, the probability of \nmaintaining plasma ofatumumab concentrations >10 \u00b5g/mL was high with both dosing \nschedules.  With a 21-day cycle length, the probability of maintaining Cp >10 \uf06dg/mL was >90% \nafter the first cycle and >95% throughout the remainder of the six-cycle dosing period and for \nfour weeks after the last dose; the probability of Cp >10 \u00b5g/mL was approximately 89% at \neight weeks after the last dose.  With a 28-day cycle length, the probability of maintaining \nCp >10 \uf06dg/mL was 84% after the first cycle and >95% throughout the remainder of the six-\ncycle dosing period and for four weeks after the last dose; the probability of Cp >10 \uf06dg/mL \nwas approximately 85% at eight weeks after the last dose.  Thus, a dosing schedule of 1000 \nmg infusions on Day 1 of each 21-day or 28-day cycle for 12 doses is expected to achieve \nprolonged maintenance of plasma concentrations >10 \u03bcg/mL in a high proportion of subjects \nwith FL.\nPrior clinical experience in a Phase I/II trial of ofatumumab in subjects with relapsed or \nrefractory FL suggests that four weekly infusions of 300 mg to 1000 mg are effective [Study \nHx-CD20-001; Hagenbeek, 2008].  Responses were observed in all four dose groups [300 mg: \n5 of 8 subjects (63%); 500 mg: 3 of 9 subjects (33%); 700 mg: 2 of 10 subjects (20%); and \n1000 mg: 5 of 10 subjects (50%)].  Thus, a regimen using twelve 1000 mg doses of \nofatumumab at 21-day or 28-day intervals is expected to be effective.\nIn ongoing studies in subjects with FL, repeated doses of 500 mg or 1000 mg of ofatumumab \nhave been administered.  In Study Hx-CD20-405, ofatumumab was administered at 500 mg or \n1000 mg weekly for seven weeks after an initial infusion of 300 mg in subjects with FL \nrefractory to rituximab in combination with chemotherapy; in Study Hx-CD20-409, \nofatumumab doses of 500 mg or 1000 mg were administered every three weeks after an initial \ninfusion of 300 mg in combination with CHOP for a total of six cycles in subjects with \npreviously untreated FL.  In these two studies, there were no unexpected safety findings \nreported during treatment and within 30 days of last infusion.  The results from these studies \nsuggest that administration of 1000 mg at 21- or 28-day intervals is expected to be well \ntolerated.\nAn important safety factor of any antibody therapy concerns infusion reaction, particularly \nfollowing the first intravenous administration.  Both the proportion of patients experiencing \ninfusion reactions to rituximab and the severity of the reactions are higher for the first \ninfusion than for subsequent infusions [Chung, 2007]. Early experience with ofatumumab \nshowed a similar pattern of infusion reactions [Coiffier, 2008; Hagenbeek, 2008], and a first \ninfusion dose of 300 mg was therefore adopted in all studies in the ofatumumab development \nprogram to minimize first dose infusion reaction.  However, upon further review of the data \ncollected in the phase I/II study of ofatumumab in subjects with relapsed or refractory FL\ngrade I-II (Study Hx-CD20-001), no clinically significant differences in the severity or \nfrequency of AEs were observed with increasing dose.  As a result, the median duration of the \nfirst infusion and the number of infusion reactions between subjects with FL receiving \nofatumumab at doses of 300 mg, 500 mg, 700 mg, or 1000 mg did not differ significantly\n[OFATUMUMAB, 2012; Hagenbeek, 2008]. Thus, the use of 1000 mg at first infusion is \nproposed in study OMB110918.\nPrior clinical experience with rituximab suggests that prolonged administration schedules \nenhance response duration in subjects with NHL [reviewed in Collins-Burow, 2007; \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 42\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nGhielmini, 2004; Cersosimo, 2003].  Prior clinical experience with ofatumumab demonstrated \nlonger median duration of response with the addition of four infusions at four-week intervals \nafter the end of weekly ofatumumab treatment in subjects with fludarabine-refractory CLL \n(Study Hx-CD20-406).  The proposed regimen is twelve infusions of ofatumumab to be \nadministered with up to 8 cycles of bendamustine.  The proposed ofatumumab regimen of 12 \ndoses increases the duration of ofatumumab exposure, which should maintain chemo-\nsensitization of FL to concomitant chemotherapy while enhancing response duration.\n3.2.2.1\nOfatumumab monotherapy for subjects who progress in Arm B\nSubjects who progress during or after therapy in Arm B (bendamustine alone) will be offered \nofatumumab monotherapy.  Data regarding ofatumumab monotherapy in this population were \nobtained in Study Hx-CD20-405, in which subjects with rituximab-refractory FL were \nrandomized to single agent ofatumumab at 500 mg or 1000 mg weekly for 7 doses after a 300 \nmg initial dose (total of 8 doses).  The response rate was 11%, and mPFS was 6 months, with \nno difference between the dose groups.  Experience in CLL indicates that increasing the dose \nintensity of rituximab was able to improve the ORR significantly from 10-15% to 45% [Byrd, \n2001].  In addition, ofatumumab at a dose of 2000 mg showed significant clinical activity \nwith an acceptable safety profile in subjects with fludarabine-refractory CLL in Study Hx-\nCD20-406.  Therefore, it is reasonable to examine the 2000 mg dose in patients with \nrefractory indolent NHL.\nThe optimal duration of therapy in this setting is unclear.  Study Hx-CD20-406 administered \neight weekly doses of ofatumumab 2000 mg (first dose 300 mg) followed by four monthly \ndoses of 2000 mg; however, the standard length of weekly rituximab therapy in FL is four \nweeks, and there are no convincing data that increasing the number of weekly rituximab \ninfusions from 4 to 8 is of benefit.\nThe rituximab-refractory FL population in this study may have more disease (and thus, faster \nclearance) and shorter PFS following four weeks of ofatumumab monotherapy than subjects \nwith rituximab-sensitive FL.  Thus, more frequent administration may be necessary for \nextended dosing in this refractory population, similar to the subjects with fludarabine-\nrefractory CLL in Study Hx-CD20-406, who received monthly extended doses.\nInfusion reactions occur more frequently at the initial infusion. Patients with indolent NHL \nare less likely to have severe infusion toxicity than CLL patients because they do not have \ncirculating peripheral blood tumor cells which react with antibody.\nTo date, no subjects have received 2000 mg as the initial dose, while subjects with FL\nreceived an initial infusion of 1000 mg in Study Hx-CD20-001.  Thus, a first dose of 1000 mg \nwill be used in Arm A (Appendix 1 , Section 3.1.4) and for subjects that progress on Arm B \nand select optional ofatumumab (Appendix 3, Section 3.1.6).  Study Hx-CD20-001 infused a \n2 mg/mL concentration of ofatumumab at an initial rate of 25 mL/hr.  Due to the observed \ntolerability associated with this concentration and rate, Study OMB110918 will infuse \nofatumumab (2 mg/mL) at a starting rate of 25 mL/hr for infusions that follow the initial \ninfusion for subjects that select ofatumumab following PD in Arm B (Appendix 3, Section \n3.1.6).\n",

If, however, the infusion rate was 12 mL/hr before the \npause, the recommendation is for the infusion to be restarted at 12 mL/hr.

Subjects who fail to meet these requirements will have therapy held until \ncounts recover to these levels, and the bendamustine dose must be delayed or modified as \nspecified in Table 5 (Arm A) or Table 6 (Arm B).  Once a subject has undergone dose \nmodification, subsequent cycles will give the modified dose of bendamustine.\nIf continued bendamustine-related toxicities occur beyond reasonable delay for recovery in \neither arm, study treatment will be discontinued (See Table 5 and Table 6).

The sum of the products of the \ndiameters (SPD) will be calculated for each category of target lesions when there are multiple \ntarget lesions present in the category. For guidance on calculation of the SPD refer to SPM\nand Table 7.\nDuring follow-up, with the exception of lesions that regress to >0 cm x >0 cm and \uf0a30.5 cm x \n\uf0a30.5 cm the best estimate of the lesion dimensions must be reported even if necrosis, fibrosis \nor cavitation are present. If a lesion is present but has regressed to between >0 cm x >0 cm \nand \uf0a30.5cm x \uf0a30.5cm, \u2018too small to measure\u2019 will be assigned and a default size of 0.5 cm x \n0.5 cm will be used for calculation purposes.  A lesion that is absent would be recorded as >0 \ncm x >0 cm.\nAll other lesions (measurable or non-measurable) will be identified as non-target lesions and \nrecorded at baseline. Measurements of non-target lesions are not required, but the \npresence/absence or unequivocal progression of each will be noted throughout follow-up.\nLiver and spleen size will be reported as normal, enlarged not due to lymphoma, enlarged due \nto lymphoma (nodules must be present for this to be reported), or unequivocal progression \n(nodules must be present for this to be reported).\nThe definition of unequivocal progression of non-target disease is based on the definition \napplied in RECIST 1.1 [Eisenhauer, 2009] as an overall level of substantial worsening in non-\ntarget disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor \nburden has increased significantly to merit discontinuation of therapy, or if therapy has \nalready been completed, commencement of anti-cancer therapy.  A modest \u2018increase\u2019 in the \nsize of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal \nprogression status.  The designation of progression solely on the basis of change in non-target \ndisease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.\n6.2.5.1\nCalculation of SPD\nIncrease or decrease of SPD of target lesions will be calculated based on the formula as seen \nin Table 7.\nTable 7\nSum of Products Greatest Diameter Measurements (SPD)\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 60\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nDecrease \nrate=\nSPD before treatment \u2013 SPD at assessment\nX100%\nSPD before treatment\nIncrease \nrate=\nSPD at assessment \u2013 smallest SPD during the study\nX100%\nSmallest SPD during the study\n6.2.5.2\nComplete Remission (CR)\nThe designation of CR requires the following:\n1.\nComplete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related \nsymptoms if present before therapy. All target nodes must have regressed to \uf0a31.5cm in \nthe longest diameter (non-measured nodes 1.1-1.5cm in the longest diameter and >1cm in \nthe short axis at baseline, must regress to \uf0a31cm in the short axis by visual estimation).\n2.\nThe spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged due to lymphoma (nodules must be \npresent) before therapy based on a CT scan and must be considered normal size by \nimaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma must disappear. However, \ndetermination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because a spleen considered \nnormal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen may reflect \nvariations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes \nother than lymphoma.\n3.\nIf the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must have \ncleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on which this determination is \nmade must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is \nindeterminate by morphology, it must be negative by immunohistochemistry. A sample \nthat is negative by immunohistochemistry but that demonstrates a small population of \nclonal lymphocytes by flow cytometry will be considered a CR until data become \navailable demonstrating a clear difference in subject outcome.\n6.2.5.3\nPartial Remission (PR)\nThe designation of PR requires all of the following:\n1. At least a 50% decrease from baseline in sum of the SPD of target nodes. \n2. The categories of target splenic/hepatic nodules and other extranodal lesions must \neach regress by \u226550% in their SPD compared to baseline. If the category only \ncontains a single nodule/lesion, it must regress by \u226550% in the greatest transverse \ndiameter compared to baseline.\n3. No unequivocal progression must be observed in non-target lesions, liver, or spleen \nsize.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 61\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\n4.\nBone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was \npositive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type must be specified (e.g., \nlarge-cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Subjects who achieve a CR by the \nabove criteria, but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will \nbe considered partial responders. When the bone marrow was involved before \ntherapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after \ntreatment, subjects must be considered partial responders.\n5. No new sites of disease must be observed.\n6.2.5.4\nStable Disease (SD)\nA subject is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR \nor PR, but does not fulfill those for PD [Cheson, 2007].\n6.2.5.5\nRelapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)\nCriteria for determining PD for new lesions and target lesions are shown in Table 8.\nTable 8\nCriteria for determining PD for new lesions and target lesions\nNodes\nExtranodal (\u2018liver/spleen\u2019 & \u2018other\u2019 \ncategories)\nNew node/lesiona\nA previously normal node (\u22641.5 x \n\u22641.0 cm), including nodes that were \nnot previously visible, must increase \nto >2.0 x \u22651.5 cm.\nAn unequivocal new lesion at a site \nwhere there was no disease at \nbaseline, provided the lesion cannot \nbe attributed to non-lymphoma-related \ncauses.\nSingle node/lesion\nIncrease in PPD\n\u226550% increase from nadir in the \nPPD of any target node.

Thus TLS should be suspected in subjects with large \ntumor burden who develop acute renal failure along with hyperuricemia (> 15 mg/dL) or \nhyperphosphatemia (> 8 mg/dL). Acute uric acid nephropathy is associated with little or no \nurine output. The urinalysis may show uric acid crystals or amorphous urates. The \nhypersecretion of uric acid can be detected with a high urine uric acid:creatinine ratio > 1.0, \ncompared to a value of 0.6-0.7 for most other causes of acute renal failure.\nIn those patients considered to be at risk for TLS, management of TLS includes correction of \nelectrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function, maintenance of fluid balance (consider \naggressive hydration i.e. ~3,000 ml/m2/day fluid administered parenterally) and supportive \ncare. If signs of TLS occur the investigator can administer rasburicase, allopurinol (e.g. \nZyloprim, Allohexal, Allosig, Progout, Zyloric), or other drugs used to treat hyperuricemia, \nper prescribing information, if deemed appropriate.  \n6.5.4.1.4 Handling Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\nPML is a viral-induced demyelinating disease of the central nervous system usually occurring \nin the immunocompromised individual and has been reported with ofatumumab. JC virus \n(JCV) infection resulting in PML and death has been reported in rituximab-treated subjects \nwith hematologic malignancies or with systemic lupus erythematosus, an indication for which \nrituximab has not been approved. Investigators and nurses should pay careful attention for \nsigns and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of PML. Signs and symptoms of PML \ninclude visual disturbances, ocular movements, ataxia, and changes in mental status such as \ndisorientation or confusion. These symptoms are not an exhaustive list, and the investigator \nshould exercise judgment in deciding to report signs and symptoms to sponsor promptly.\nIf a subject develops neurological signs or symptoms consistent with PML, treatment should \nbe halted and the subject referred to a neurologist for evaluation. At a minimum, blood JCV \nPCR and/or MRI should be performed; if either test is positive, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) \nJCV PCR should be performed. If blood JCV PCR and MRI are negative, the investigator \nshould contact the Sponsor for appropriate action to be taken.

The interim analysis of PFS \nwas conducted in the same manner as described for the primary analysis, and further details of \nthe interim analysis areprovided in the IDMC Charter.\nPer Amendment 9, the primary analysis will take place after approximately 215 PFS events\nby IRC.  The primary analysis of PFS will be tested based on a two-sided test, with a \nsignificance level of 0.0483 (See Section 8.2 - Primary Analysis for details).

A sample (further details in Section 3.1.1 and lab manual) will be required at screening unless an appropriate previous sample is available.  A bone marrow biopsy will be \nperformed no later than \uf0a38 weeks following CR (as judged by investigator) if the BM sample were positive at the start of the study.\n14. Includes BP, temperature, and pulse.  Documented at screening and during treatment for both treatment arms, See Section 6.1.9.\n15. Only SAEs relating to study procedures or Novartis concomitant medication should be reported.  See Section 6.5\n16. All SAEs regardless of causality will be reported from 61 days after the last dose of investigational product to the end of the follow-up period or withdrawal or until initiation of \nsubsequent anti-lymphoma therapy is initiated. Any SAE brought to the investigator's attention after the start of subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy and considered by the \ninvestigator as possibly related to either ofatumumab or bendamustine must be reported to Novartis.  See Section 6.5 for more details.\n17. Only steroids, growth factors, transfusions, anticancer, and anti-infectious treatments will be followed from 61 days after the last dose of investigational product to the end of the \nfollow-up period or withdrawal or until initiation of subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy..\n18. FACT-Lym, EQ-5D, and HCQ (except at screening) paper questionnaires are to be completed at all specified visits.  Sites will transcribe completed questionnaires into eCRFs.If \nPD, then complete on Day 1 of progression determination and once post PD.\n19. Monthly ofatumumab dosing begins 28 days after Day 1 of the previous cycle.  Arm B will not receive ofatumumab every 1M, but must come into the clinic for scheduled visits and \nprocedures as if they were on the every 1 month (q28 day) schedule following 8 cycles of bendamustine.\n20. Subjects in both arms must come for scheduled Day 84, Day 168, and Day 252 visits (+7 days).  See SPM.\n21. This is follow-up schedule #1.  The F/U 1 schedule, in both arms, begins on Day 336 (this is 3 months following Day 252) and will continue every 3 months until Month 18 of the \nF/U phase (Table 1).  There will be a \u00b17 day visit window around each visit.\n22. This is follow-up schedule #2 (Table 1).  The F/U 2 schedule comes after the end of F/U 1 and continues until Month 60 in the F/U phase. Visits will occur at least every 12 months \nuntil Month 54 or earlier if clinical symptoms of progression are suspected.  CT scans must occur every 12 months (but may occur more frequently if clinical symptoms of \nprogression are suspected).  The last required yearly CT scan will be done on Month 54 of F/U2.  Following Month 54, subjects will be followed until Month 60 of the F/U phase.  \nCT scans will be done to confirm any clinical signs or suspicion of PD throughout the study.  There will be a \u00b114 day visit window around each day.\n23. Subjects that progress in Arm B (bendamustine alone) will have the option to receive ofatumumab monotherapy.  If Arm B subjects select ofatumumab monotherapy, they must \nhave PD confirmed by independent radiology review.  If PD confirmed, Appendix 3 assessments will be followed.  They must not continue with Appendix 2 survival assessments.  \nSee Section 3.1.6 and for more details.  Subjects with PD, as confirmed by CT scan, will be followed for survival.  Survival follow-up visits begin 2 months after PD is confirmed by \nCT scan or start of non-protocol treatment.. Additionally, subjects without PD who stop protocol treatment and begin non-protocol treatment will go into Survival Follow-Up.  \nSurvival follow-up visits will occur every 3 months (\u00b1 7 days) until Month 18 of the F/U phase then every 12 months (\u00b1 14 days) until Month 54 of the F/U phase. Refer to Section \n3.1.5.  Following Month 54, subjects will be followed until Month 60.  Table 1 describes this F/U schedule.    Subjects in Arm B with PD may select optional ofatumumab \nmonotherapy and are followed up according to Appendix 3.  PD must be confirmed by an independent review prior to receiving ofatumumab monotherapy.  Survival follow-up \nvisits may be phone-calls instead of physician office visits. \n24. There are 2 types of withdrawal (WD):  WD from investigational product and WD from study.  See Section 4.4 for details on withdrawal criteria.  If a subject, without PD, \ndiscontinues or withdraws from treatment (for any reason), the subject remains in the study and completes all scheduled visits that have assessments, but without study drug.  In \nthe event a subject WD consent from study, the WD visit must be completed.  CT scan done at WD from study if last CT was >91 days. One month is 28 days when being treated \nin this study.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 104\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\n25. Treatment is expected to be given on the scheduled days.  A visit window of 3 days following the scheduled day will be allowed between cycles but there is no visit window once \nthe subject has entered the cycle (except bendamustine may be administered on either Days 1,2 or Days 2,3 if needed).  There is a minimum 21 day interval between cycles (See \nSection 9.7). \n26. Assess disease symptoms as defined in Section 6.2.4 of protocol on Days 84, 168, and 252 (+7 days), F/U 1, F/U 2 or withdrawal.  Assess disease symptoms during follow-up \nvisits.\n27.

Following Month 54, subjects will \nhave one more survival F/U on Month 60 of the entire F/U phase.  Table 1 describes this F/U visit schedule.  Subjects in Arm B with PD may select optional ofatumumab \nmonotherapy.  PD must be confirmed by an independent review prior to receiving ofatumumab monotherapy. Survival follow-up visits may be phone-calls instead of physician \noffice visits See Section 3.1.6 for more details.  Subjects with PD or are no longer receiving treatment will be followed for survival.\n16. There are 2 types of withdrawal (WD):  WD from investigational product and WD from study.  See Section 4.4 for details on withdrawal criteria.  If a subject, without PD \ndiscontinues or withdraws from treatment (for any reason) the subject remains in the study and completes all scheduled visits without study drug.  In the event a subject withdraws \nconsent from study, the WD visit must be completed.  CT scan done at WD from study if last CT was >91 days.\n17. Subjects that progress in Arm B (bendamustine alone) will have the option to receive fatumumab monotherapy.  If Arm B subjects decide to receive ofatumumab monotherapy \nthen they must follow Appendix 3 and must not continue with Appendix 2 survival assessments.

A visit window of 3 days following the scheduled day will be allowed between cycles but there is no visit window once the subject has entered the cycle (except bendamustine may \nbe administered on either Days 1,2 or Days 2,3 if needed).  There is a minimum 21 day interval between cycles.  In the event the 1st infusion of bendamustine is on Day 2 of a \ncycle, then assessments required for Day 1 (except HAHA, ofatumumab plasma concentration, Ig, and flow cytometry) will be done on Day 2 and the assessments required for \nDay 2 will now be done on Day 3.  See SPM for more details.  The protocol must be followed as closely as possible.  If as per local practice, a blood draw for hematology analysis \nprior to the visit date is required, it would be acceptable for hematology analysis, but the blood draw can be taken no more than 3 days ahead of the visit date. Blood draws \nperformed by local laboratories (e.g. for quicker pre-dose response assessment or assessment of toxicity) of protocol-required lab assessments are acceptable; however, it is \nimportant that the sample for the central laboratory analysis is taken at the same time.  Since absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and \nhemoglobin results are required to establish if a bendamustine dose reduction and/or treatment delay is required, the results of each of these local laboratory tests must also be \nentered into the eCRF if it is used to manage a dose delay or dose reduction .

See Section 4.4 for details \non withdrawal criteria (exception: no PRO will be done in Appendix 3).  If a subject, without PD, discontinues or \nwithdraws from treatment (for any reason) the subject remains in the study and completes all scheduled visits without \nstudy drug.  In the event a subject withdraws from study, the WD visit must be completed.  CT scan done at WD from \nstudy if last CT was >91 days.\n19. This is follow-up schedule #1 (schedule frequency shown in Table 1).  F/U 1, in both arms, begins 1 month following last \ninfusion of ofatumumab.  Follow-up will continue every 3 months until Month 18 of the F/U phase.  There will be a \u00b17 \nday visit window around each visit.\n20. The follow-up #2 schedule comes after the end of F/U 1 and continues until Month 60 of the entire F/U phase (schedule \nfrequency shown in Table 1).  Visits will occur every 12 months until Month 54 or earlier if clinical symptoms of \nprogression are seen.  Following Month 54, subjects will be followed until Month 60 of the F/U phase.  There will be a \n\u00b114 day visit window around each day.\n21. Subjects with PD, as confirmed by CT scan, will be followed for survival.

This suggested that it may be prudent to give the \nmaintenance doses more frequently than every 8 weeks to ensure that patients will actually be \nable to receive extended dosing before their FL progresses.  To date, we have no evidence that \n2000 mg is more effective than 1000 mg in FL.  Therefore, we will use 1000 mg as the \nmaintenance dose in Study OMB110918 study.  However, we will administer the maintenance \ndoses every 4 weeks in anticipation of faster antibody clearance and faster disease progression.\nOFATUMUMAB MONOTHERAPY FOR PATIENTS WHO PROGRESS IN ARM B\nA study a regimen of ofatumumab 2000 mg weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2000 mg every 4 \nweeks for 4 additional doses (total: 8 doses) in rituximab-refractory FL patients who progress \nduring or following single agent bendamustine will be offered to subjects with PD in Arm B.  \nThis study design will allow us to study 1) ofatumumab monotherapy using the 2000 mg dose \nand 2) extended dosing using a monthly schedule in the context of an existing study in \nrituximab-refractory FL.  This is a change from dosing ofatumumab (1000 mg), weekly for 8 \ndoses.  \nTo gain information about higher doses of ofatumumab monotherapy in refractory FL, \npatients who progress during or after therapy in Arm B (bendamustine alone) will be offered \nofatumumab monotherapy.  The only data regarding the dose-response relationship of anti-\nCD20 antibody monotherapy in this poor patient population was obtained in Study Hx-CD20-\n405, in which patients with rituximab-refractory FL were randomized to single agent \nofatumumab 500 mg or 1000 mg weekly for 8 doses.  The response rate was approximately \n10%, and median PFS was 6 months, with no difference between the treatment arms.  While \nthe study indicated that administering ofatumumab monotherapy at 500-1000 mg weekly was \nnot highly effective in rituximab-refractory FL patients, the role of dose intensification is \nunknown in this patient population.  Our experience in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) \nindicated that increasing the dose intensity of rituximab was able to significantly improve the \noverall response rate from 10-15% to 45%.  Furthermore, ofatumumab showed significant \nclinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in Study Hx-CD20-406 study in fludarabine-\nrefractory CLL when administered at a dose of 2000 mg.  Therefore, it is reasonable to \nexamine the 2000 mg dose in refractory FL.  The optimal duration of therapy in this setting is \nunclear.  The 406 study administered 8 weekly doses of ofatumumab 2000 mg (first dose 300 \nmg) followed by 4 monthly doses of 2000 mg.  However, the standard length of weekly \nrituximab therapy in FL is 4 weeks, and there are no convincing data that increasing the \nnumber of weekly ritxuimab infusions from 4 to 8 is of benefit.  \nWe will study extended dosing of ofatumumab monotherapy in this patient group, similar to \nour plan in Study OMB113676.  However, Study OMB110918 will enroll rituximab-\nrefractory, indolent NHL patients who are expected to have more disease following 4 weeks \nof ofatumumab monotherapy (and thus, faster ofatumumab clearance) and have shorter PFS \nthan the rituximab-sensitive relapsed FL patients in the 676 study.  Thus, more frequent \ndosing of ofatumumab may be necessary for extended dosing in this patient population, \nsimilar to the monthly maintenance dosing in CLL in Study Hx-CD20-406.  Therefore, the \nextended dosing will consist of 2000 mg given monthly for 4 doses.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 131\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nOFATUMUMAB DOSING FREQUENCY:  12 INFUSIONS OF OFATUMUMAB IN \nARM A\nClarification in response criteria (Section 6.2.4, Section 6.2.4.2, Section 6.2.4.3, and Section \n6.2.4.5).  \nRESPONSE CRITERIA\nSection 6.2 (Efficacy Assessments) updated for clarity\nSPECIFIC PROTOCOL CHANGES FOR AMENDMENT 1 (16-NOVEMBER-2009) FROM \nPROTOCOL (DATED 7-AUG-2009)\nLIST OF SPECIFIC CHANGES\nNote:  deleted language is presented with a strikethrough and added language is printed in \nbold.\nEXAMPLE:\nSection:\nThroughout Document\nOriginal text:\nPatient\nText changed to:\nSubject\nRationale for Change:\nFor consistent use of terminology throughout the document.

The proposed schedule is Day 1 of each \n21-day or 28-day cycle, depending upon the IDMC dose recommendation for Stage 2 of the \nstudy (Section 3.1.3).\nPreclinical data suggest that ofatumumab plasma concentrations >10 \uf06dg/mL are sufficient to\nsuppress peripheral B-cell recovery in cynomolgus monkeys as well as to suppress tumor cell \ngrowth in Daudi tumor-bearing SCID mice [Bleeker, 2008].  SCID mice previously \ninoculated with Daudi B-cells received ofatumumab at 0.5 and 50 mg/kg and were observed \nfor tumor growth.  Tumor growth was delayed 3-4 weeks after ofatumumab administration, \nwith a greater duration of tumor growth inhibition at the higher dose level.  Acceleration of \ntumor growth was observed at the timepoint at which ofatumumab concentrations had \ndropped below 0.4 \uf06dg/mL.\nIn the Bleeker study, cynomolgus monkeys received ofatumumab at three dose levels:  1.25, \n6.25, or 12.5 mg daily for four consecutive days (cumulative doses 5, 25, or 50 mg/kg).  A \nprofound B-cell depletion was induced both peripherally and in the lymph nodes, with a \nlonger time to recovery at higher dose levels.  Ofatumumab concentrations above 50 \uf06dg/mL \nwere sufficient for complete B-cell depletion.  Recovery of CD20+ cells in peripheral blood \nand lymph nodes was detected when plasma ofatumumab concentrations had dropped below \n5-10 \uf06dg/mL.  Thus, a potential clinical target in developing ofatumumab dosing regimens is \nprolonged maintenance of plasma concentrations >10 \uf06dg/mL.\nPharmacokinetic data from the Phase I study in subjects with relapsed or refractory follicular \nlymphoma (FL) (Study Hx-CD20-001) were analyzed using a two-compartment model with a \ndecrease in clearance after the first dose and assuming a stepped-rate infusion using a \nnonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach (NONMEM).  The resulting model was used to \nsimulate concentration-time data for 500 subjects receiving ofatumumab infusions at 1000 mg \non the first day of each 21-day or 28-day cycle for a total of six cycles.  Based on the \nsimulations, the probability of maintaining plasma ofatumumab concentrations >10 \u00b5g/mL \nwas high with both dosing schedules.  With a 21-day cycle length, the probability of \nmaintaining Cp >10 \uf06dg/mL was >90% after the first cycle and >95% throughout the \nremainder of the six-cycle dosing period and for four weeks after the last dose; the probability \nof Cp >10 \u00b5g/mL was approximately 89% at eight weeks after the last dose.  With a 28-day \ncycle length, the probability of maintaining Cp >10 \uf06dg/mL was 84% after the first cycle \nand >95% throughout the remainder of the six-cycle dosing period and for four weeks after \nthe last dose; the probability of Cp >10 \uf06dg/mL was approximately 85% at eight weeks after \nthe last dose.  Thus, a dosing schedule of 1000 mg infusions on Day 1 of each 21-day or 28-\nday cycle for six cycles is expected to achieve prolonged maintenance of plasma \nconcentrations >10 \u03bcg/mL in a high proportion of subjects with follicular lymphoma.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 143\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nPrior clinical experience in a Phase I trial of ofatumumab in subjects with relapsed or \nrefractory FL suggests that four weekly infusions of 300 mg to 1000 mg are effective.  [Study \nHx-CD20-001; Hagenbeek, 2008]  Responses were observed in all four dose groups [(300 mg: \n5 of 8 subjects (63%); 500 mg: 3 of 10 subjects (30%); 700 mg: 2 of 10 subjects (20%); and \n1000 mg: 5 of 10 subjects (50%)].  Thus, a regimen using six 1000 mg doses of ofatumumab \nat 21-day or 28-day intervals is expected to be effective.  \nThere was no apparent difference in the severity and number of adverse events between \npatients with FL receiving ofatumumab at doses ranging from 300 mg to 1000 mg, including \nfull ofatumumab doses at first infusion [Study Hx-CD20-001].  Thus, the use of a full \nofatumumab dose (i.e., 1000 mg) at first infusion is proposed in this study.\nIn ongoing studies, 1000 mg of ofatumumab has been administered weekly for seven weeks \nafter an initial infusion of 300 mg in subjects with FL refractory to rituximab in combination \nwith chemotherapy (Study Hx-CD20-405) and administered every three weeks after an initial \ninfusion of 300 mg in combination with CHOP for a total of six cycles in subjects with \npreviously untreated FL (Study Hx-CD20-409).  Although no efficacy results are currently \navailable, no major safety issues have been observed to date [OFATUMUMAB Investigator \nBrochure, 2009].\nPrior clinical experience with rituximab suggests that prolonged or maintenance \nadministration schedules enhance response duration in subjects with NHL. [reviewed in \nCollins-Burow, 2007; Ghielmini, 2004; Cersosimo, 2003].

[Study \nHx-CD20-001; Hagenbeek, 2008]  Responses were observed in all four dose groups (300 mg: \n5 of 8 subjects (63%); 500 mg: 3 of 10 subjects (30%); 700 mg: 2 of 10 subjects (20%); and \n1000 mg: 5 of 10 subjects (50%).  Thus, a regimen using twelve 1000 mg doses of \nofatumumab at 21-day or 28-day intervals is expected to be effective.  \nThere was no apparent difference in the severity and number of adverse events between \npatients with FL receiving ofatumumab at doses ranging from 300 mg to 1000 mg, including \nfull ofatumumab doses at first infusion [Hagenbeek, 2008].  Thus, the use of a full \nofatumumab dose (i.e., 1000 mg) at first infusion is proposed in this study.\nIn ongoing studies in subjects with FL, repeated doses of 500 mg or 1000 mg of \nofatumumab have been administered.  In Study Hx-CD20-405, ofatumumab was \nadministered at 500 mg or 1000 mg weekly for seven weeks after an initial infusion of 300 \nmg in subjects with FL refractory to rituximab in combination with chemotherapy; in Study \nHx-CD20-409, ofatumumab doses of 500 mg or 1000 mg were administered every three \nweeks after an initial infusion of 300 mg in combination with CHOP for a total of six cycles \nin subjects with previously untreated FL.  In these two studies, there were no unexpected \nsafety findings reported during treatment and within 30 days of last infusion.  The \nresults from these studies suggest that administration of 1000 mg at 21- or 28-day \nintervals is expected to be well tolerated.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 145\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nPrior clinical experience with rituximab suggests that prolonged or maintenance \nadministration schedules enhance response duration in subjects with NHL. [reviewed in \nCollins-Burow, 2007; Ghielmini, 2004; Cersosimo, 2003].  Prior clinical experience with \nofatumumab demonstrated longer median duration of response with the addition of four \ninfusions at four-week intervals after the end of weekly ofatumumab treatment in \nsubjects with fludarabine-refractory CLL (Study Hx-CD20-406).  The proposed regimen \nof twelve ofatumumab six-cycle dosing schedule with doses administered.  The proposed \nofatumumab regimen of 12 doses administered at 21-day or 28-day intervals increases the \nduration of ofatumumab exposure, which should maintain chemosensitization of FL to \nconcomitant chemotherapy while enhancing response duration.\nOFATUMUMAB MONOTHERAPY FOR SUBJECTS WHO PROGRESS IN ARM B\nSubjects who progress during or after therapy in Arm B (bendamustine alone) will be \noffered ofatumumab monotherapy.  Data regarding ofatumumab monotherapy in this \npopulation were obtained in Study Hx-CD20-405, in which subjects with rituximab-\nrefractory FL were randomized to single agent ofatumumab at 500 mg or 1000 mg \nweekly for 7 doses after a 300 mg initial dose (total of 8 doses).  The response rate was \napproximately 10%, and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6 months, with no \ndifference between the dose groups.  Experience in CLL indicates that increasing the \ndose intensity of rituximab was able to mprove the overall response rate significantly \nfrom 10-15% to 45% (add references); in addition, ofatumumab at a dose of 2000 mg \nshowed significant clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in subjects with \nfludarabine-refractory CLL in Study Hx-CD20-406.  Therefore, it is reasonable to \nexamine the 2000 mg dose in refractory FL.  \nThe optimal duration of therapy in this setting is unclear.  Study Hx-CD20-406 \nadministered eight weekly doses of ofatumumab 2000 mg (first dose 300 mg) followed by \nfour monthly doses of 2000 mg; however, the standard length of weekly rituximab \ntherapy in FL is four weeks, and there are no convincing data that increasing the \nnumber of weekly rituximab infusions from 4 to 8 is of benefit.   \nThe rituximab-refractory FL population in this study may have more disease (and thus, \nfaster clearance) and shorter PFS following four weeks of ofatumumab monotherapy \nthan subjects with rituximab-sensitive FL.  Thus, more frequent administration may be \nnecessary for extended dosing in this refractory population, similar to the subjects with \nfludarabine-refractory CLL in Study Hx-CD20-406, who received monthly extended \ndoses.\nThus, a regimen of 2000 mg ofatumumab for four weekly doses followed by 2000 mg \nofatumumab every 4 weeks for four additional doses (for a total of 8 doses) will be \noffered to the subjects in Arm B who have progressive disease during or after \nbendamustine monotherapy.\nSection 4.1:\nNumber of Subjects\nOriginal text:\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 146\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nSubjects who meet all the following inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for \nenrollment into the study.

Results may be provided in the form of a bone marrow \nbiopsy report when a previous aspirate and biopsy are not available as long as \nthe report was based on the biopsy done within 8 weeks prior to randomization.  \nTo confirm that disease has not transformed to a Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, an \nincisional or excisional lymph node biopsy of accessible adenopathy is highly \nrecommended.  In less accessible lymph nodes, 4 to 8 core biopsies are \nrecommended, but not required. If the investigator has clinical suspicion that the \nprotocol candidate has transformed disease, the investigator should not consider that \nsubject for the trial. \n\uf0b7\nBone marrow aspirate, biopsy, and lymph node pathology report including details \nconfirming CD20+ tumor status will be sent to GSK along with tissue or slides for \ncentral review.

Both the proportion of patients \nexperiencing infusion reactions to rituximab and the severity of the reactions are higher \nfor the first infusion than for subsequent infusions [Chung, 2008]. Early experience with \nofatumumab showed a similar pattern of infusion reactions [Coiffier, 2008; Hagenbeek, \n2008], and a first infusion dose of 300 mg was therefore adopted in all studies in the \nofatumumab development program to minimise first dose infusion reaction.  However, \nupon further review of the data collected in the phase I/II study of ofatumumab in \npatients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma grade I-II (Study Hx-CD20-\n001), no clinically significant  differences in the severity or frequency of adverse events \nwere  observed.  As a result, the median duration of the first infusion and the number of \ninfusion reactions between patients with FL receiving ofatumumab at doses of 300 mg, \n500 mg, 700 mg, or 1000 mg, including ofatumumab doses of up to 1000 mg did not \ndiffer significantly.   [OFATUMUMAB, 2011; Hagenbeek, 2008]. Thus, the use of 1000 \nmg at first infusion is proposed in study OMB110918.\nRationale:  Provides additional rationale for 1000 mg initial infusion.  Also clarifies there was \nlittle difference between dose cohorts regarding infusion time and infusion reactions upon \ninitial infusion.\nSection 3.2.2.1:\nOfatumumab monotherapy for subjects who progress in \nArm B\nText Added:\nInfusion reactions occur more frequently at the initial infusion. Patients with indolent \nNHL are less likely to have severe infusion toxicity than CLL patients because they do \nnot have circulating peripheral blood tumor cells which react with antibody.\nTo date, no subjects have received 2000 mg as the initial dose, while subjects with \nfollicular lymphoma received an initial infusion of 1000 mg in Study Hx-CD20-001.  \nThus, a first dose of 1000 mg will be used in Arm A (Appendix 1, Section 3.1.4) and for \nsubjects that progress on Arm B and select optional ofatumumab (Appendix 3, Section \n3.1.6).  Study Hx-CD20-001 infused a 2 mg/mL concentration of ofatumumab at an \ninitial rate of 25 mL/hr.  Due to the observed tolerability associated with this \nconcentration and rate, Study OMB110918 will infuse ofatumumab (2 mg/mL) at a \nstarting rate of 25 mL/hr for infusions that follow the initial infusion for subjects that \nselect ofatumumab following PD in Arm B (Appendix 3, Section 3.1.6).\nRationale:  Clarifies rationale for infusion of 2000 mg (2 mg/mL) at 25 mL/hr.\nSection 4.2:\nInclusion Criteria\nOriginal Text \nInclusion criteria 1:  Indolent lymphoma including grades 1-3a follicular, small lymphocytic, \nlymphoplasmacytic, and marginal zone lymphoma; stages III-IV, or bulky disease stage II (i.e. \nas any single mass > 5 cm in any direction) defined according to WHO guidelines [WHO, \n2001]\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 171\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nText Changes:\nInclusion criteria 1:  Small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic, marginal zone lymphoma, and \nfollicular lymphoma (FL); grades 1, 2 and 3A, defined according to WHO guidelines.\n\uf0b7\nRationale:  Expands patient population.\nSection 4.2:\nInclusion Criteria\nInclusion criteria 2:  Indolent B-cell NHL that remains stable or unresponsive during or \nwithin 6 months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (See Section \n6.2.5.5):\n\uf0b7\nMaintaining stable disease or failure to achieve PR to rituximab-based therapy.

The original \nintention of 12 months was to allow for bone marrow recovery.  Six months is sufficient for \nthis to occur.\nFor #5:  30 mg may be administered as part of standard chemotherapy in this population.  We \nshould not limit enrollment for those getting standard treatment.\nFor #7:  All of the subjects in this study will have rituximab prior to study entry.  A three \nmonth interval between last rituximab and first ofatumumab infusion would severely limit \naccrual.  Further evidence from a previous ofatumumab study (Hx-CD20-405) suggested that \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 173\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nthe interval between last rituximab and first ofatumumab infusion did not correlate with \nresponse or lack of response.\nFor #20:  This criterion repeated #7.\nFor #15:  Clarification.\nFor #18:  There may be subjects with known bendamustine and mannitol sensitivity (per \nbendamustine product label).  Bendamustine vials contain mannitol.  We want to limit them \ninto our study to minimize subjects who are hypersensitive to these agents.\nFor#21: To ensure that local acceptable standards are followed.\nSection 4.4:\nWithdrawal Criteria\n\uf0b7\nAdditional Text:  \n\uf0b7\nHAHA and PK (as indicated in Appendix 2 and Appendix 3)\nRationale:  HAHA and PK were added at these time points to determine if HAHA is present \nand to assess if it potentially interfered with ofatumumab therapy.\n\uf0b7\nSection 5.1.1:  Pre-medication\n\uf0b7\nAllows this guidance for subjects receiving bendamustine, in addition to those \nreceiving ofatumumab.\nSection 5.1.2.1:\nOfatumumab Treatment Schedule\n\uf0b7\nOriginal Text and Text Change:  \n\uf0b7\nThe starting rate of the initial infusion of 1000 mg (Section 3.1.4), or 2000 mg\n(Section 3.1.6 and Appendix 3) ofatumumab (1.0 mg/mL) should be 12 mL/hour (hr). \nIf no infusion reactions occur the infusion rate should be increased every 30 minutes, \nto a maximum of 400 mL/hr, according to Table 2. If this schedule is followed, the \n1000 mg infusion duration will be approximately 4.5 hours and the 2000 mg infusion \nduration will be approximately 6.5 hours.\nSubsequent infusions of ofatumumab\nIf the previous infusion has been completed without grade \u2265 3 infusion-associated AEs, the \nsubsequent infusion 1000 mg (Section 3.1.4, Appendix 1) or 2000 mg (Section 3.1.6 and\nAppendix 3) ofatumumab (1.0 mg/mL or 2.0 mg/mL) can start at a rate of 25 mL/hr and \nshould be doubled every 30 minutes up to a maximum of 400 mL/hr.\nRationale:  2000 mg dose no longer being used as initial infusion. The 2000 mg dose will be \nutilized for subsequent infusions if Arm B subjects with PD select optional ofatumumab.\nSection 6.2.2:\nCT Scans\nOriginal Text and Text Change:\nWhole body CT scans (with contrast of the neck (when lesion is palpable), thorax,\nabdomen, and pelvis) (with contrast of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis) will be performed\ndone as part of the efficacy evaluation and after treatment has been completed.  The scans \nmust be performed implemented according to a CT scan manual to be provided to GSK as \nmentioned in the SPM.\nIn situations where progressive disease is apparent through physical examination (such \nas massive lymphadenopathy), only the body area where progressive disease is apparent \nwill need to be scanned to confirm progressive disease.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 174\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nAn Independent Radiology Review (IRR) will review the CT scans will be assessed\naccording to an independent review.  The independent review will be described in an \nindependent review charter an independent radiology review charter, as described.  See\nSection 6.2.6 for a description of this independent review.\nFollow-up visits will begin on Day 336 (this is 3 months after Day 252) for both arms and \ncontinue during follow-up visits, or until initiation of alternative indolent lymphoma treatment \nor withdrawal (WD)\nRationale:  Specify preference for whole body CT scans with contrast of particular areas.  \nEdited text for independent review for clarity.\nSection 6.2.4:\nLymphoma Disease-Related Symptoms:\nEntire Section Added:\n\uf0b7\nAssessment for the presence of the following symptoms (done as per Appendix 1 and \nAppendix 3):\n\uf0b7\nNight sweats due to lymphoma (not due to infection or treatment)\n\uf0b7\nFever due to lymphoma (not due to infection or treatment)\n\uf0b7\nLoss of appetite due to lymphoma (not due to treatment)\n\uf0b7\nClinically significant weight loss, since the previous disease assessment, which is \ndue to lymphoma (not due to treatment)\n\uf0b7\nFatigue due to lymphoma (not due to treatment)\n\uf0b7\nOther symptoms due to lymphoma (not due to treatment)\nRationale:  Assessment of lymphoma-related symptoms is necessary for CR.  Therefore, these \nassessments must be done when response assessments are done.  These differ from \nconstitutional symptoms assessments taken during the study.  Lymphoma disease-related \nsymptoms must specifically be due to the lymphoma and cannot be due to infection or therapy.\nSection 6.2.5:\nDocumentation of Target and Non-target Lesions\nAdded Text:\nThe definition of unequivocal progression of non-target disease is based on the definition \napplied in RECIST 1.1 [Eisenhauer, 2009] as an overall level of substantial worsening in \nnon-target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the \noverall tumor burden has increased significantly to merit discontinuation of therapy, or\nif therapy has already been completed, commencement of anti-cancer therapy.  A \nmodest \u2018increase\u2019 in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to \nqualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of progression solely on the \nbasis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will \ntherefore be extremely rare.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 175\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nRationale:  Adds clarity by defining \u201cunequivocal progression\u201d.\nSection 6.2.5.2:\nComplete Remission (CR)\nOriginal Text and Text Change:\n1.\nThe spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged due to lymphoma (nodules must be \npresent) before therapy on the basis of a physical examination or CT scan should not \nbe palpable on physical examination and should be considered normal size by \nimaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear. However, \ndetermination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because a spleen \nconsidered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen \nmay reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth \nfactors, or causes other than lymphoma.\nRationale:  Spleen and lymph nodes will be assessed by CT scan and not by physical exam.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 176\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nSection 6.2.5.5:\nRelapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, \nSD)\nOriginal Text and Text Change:\nCriteria for determining PD for new lesions and target lesions are shown n Table 7\nTABLE 7\nCRITERIA FOR DETERMINING PD FOR NEW LESIONS AND TARGET \nLESIONS\nNodes\nExtranodal (\u2018liver/spleen\u2019 & \u2018other\u2019 \ncategories)\nNew node/lesiona\nA previously normal node (\u22641.5 x \n\u22641.0 cm), including nodes that were \nnot previously visible, must increase \nto >2.0 x \u22651.5 cm.\nAny new lesion, irrespective of size, \nwill be considered PD An \nunequivocal new lesion at a site \nwhere there was no disease at \nbaseline, provided the lesion cannot \nbe attributed to non-lymphoma-related \ncauses.\nSingle node/lesion\nIncrease in PPD\n\u2265 50% increase from nadir of any \npreviously involved node > 1.5 cm in \nthe long axis at baseline  in the \nPPD of any target node.

These response criteria are described in Section 6.2.  The operation and \nresponsibilities for members of that are part of the IRC independent review is described in \na separate charter.  The final determination of progression will be based on the evaluations by \nthe independent reviewer(s) and will be used for the study\u2019s efficacy analysis and submission \nto regulatory agencies.\nRationale:  Clarification.\nSection 6.3.2:\nPeripheral Blood Sampling for Hematology and \nBiochemistry\n\uf0b7\nOriginal Text and Text Change:\n\uf0b7\nA creatinine clearance will be calculated prior to drug bendamustine administration on \nDay 1 of each bendamustine cycle. (If a measured creatinine clearance is available, the \nmeasured creatinine clearance may be used).as shown in Appendix 2.  The Cockcroft-\nGault formula will be used to determine a calculated creatinine clearance:\n\uf0b7\nRationale:  Clarification when a calculated creatinine clearance will be done.\nSection 6.3.4:\nPeripheral Blood Sampling for Safety and Disease \nStatus\nOriginal Text and Text Changes:\n\uf0b7\nHepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) at screening.  Subjects receiving \nofatumumab that are Hepatitis B core positive, Hepatitis B DNA should be obtained \nat each cycle visit while on treatment and then at 1,3,6 months post treatment.

If \nreceiving ofatumumab following PD in Arm B, HACA will be taken as defined in \nAppendix 3\nRationale: HACA testing added as part of amendment 2.  Pregnancy test requirements \nclarified.\nSection 6.5.4:\nLaboratory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities \nReported as AEs and SAEs\nOriginal Text and Text Changes:\nB cell depletion, IgG below LLN, low CD19+ count, and hypogammaglobulinemia due to \ntreatment with ofatumumab are not to be reported as an AE or SAE.\nRationale:  Ofatumumab mechanism is based on successful B cell depletion with expected B \ncell recovery.\nSection 6.6.1:\nFunctional Assessment of Cancer Therapy \u2013 General \nLymphoma (FACT-G) (FACT-Lym) Subscale\nThe FACT-G has previously been used to identify quality of life in other studies of indolent \nlymphoma subjects [Witzig, 2002a; Witzig, 2002b]. The FACT-G (FACT-General) was \ndeveloped by the FACIT group for use in adults in a wide range of oncology clinical trial \npopulations. The 27 items of the FACT-G are scored in the following domains: Physical \nWell-being (7 items), Social/Family Well-being (7 items), Emotional Well-being (6 items) \nand Functional Well-being (7 items). \nSubjects respond to the items on a five point Likert scale ranging from 0 \u2018Not at all\u2019 to 4 \n\u2018Very much\u2019.    Possible ranges of score are from 0 to 108. Subjects are asked to think back \nover the past week when responding to the items. The FACT-G is designed to be self-\nadministered but has also been validated in an interview format. It has been widely used in \nvarious oncology populations.  It is available in over 50 languages and higher scores indicate \nbetter PRO.  The FACT-G is widely used and has been well validated in a number of different \ncancer indications [Overcash, 2001; Winstead, 1997; Cella 1995].\nRationale:  FACT-G was integrated into FACT-Lym questions as part of FACT-Lym version \n4.\nSection 6.7:\nAdded Text:\nSection 6.7.1:\nSample Collection for Subjects in Arm A\nA pharmacokinetic sample (and a HAHA sample) will be collected with other \nwithdrawalwithdraw assessments for subjects who withdraw from treatment.

Survival follow-up visits will occur every \n3 months until Month 18 of F/U 1.  Following F/U 1, survival visits for F/U 2 will \noccur q12 months until Month 54, then one final visit at Month 60 of the F/U phase.  \nSurvival follow-up visits begin 2 months after PD is confirmed by CT scan or start of \nnon-protocol treatment.  Subjects in Arm B with PD may select optional ofatumumab \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 183\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nmonotherapy.

There will be a \u00b17 day visit window around each F/U 1 \nvisit and a \u00b114 day visit window around each F/U 2 visit.  \n\uf0b7\nIf a subject, without PD, discontinues or withdraws (WD) from treatment (for any \nreason) the subject remains in the study and completes all scheduled visits without \nstudy drug.  In the event a subject WD from study, the WD visit (as noted in time and \nevents tables) must be completed.

A visit window of 3 days \nfollowing the scheduled day will be allowed between cycles but there is no visit \nwindow once the subject has entered the cycle (except bendamustine may be \nadministered on either Days 1,2 or Days 2,3 if needed).  There is a minimum 21 day \ninterval between cycles. \n\uf0b7\nOne month follow-up occurs following treatment completion in Arm A, regardless of \nresponse.\n\uf0b7\nHAHA and ofatumumab concentration (PK sample) sample frequency changed.  \nDuring treatment, collect every 6 months.

If as per local practice, a \nblood withdrawal for hematology and biochemistry analysis prior to the visit date is \nrequired, it would be acceptable for hematology and biochemistry analysis, but the \nblood draw can be taken no more than 3 days ahead of the visit date. Blood draws \nperformed by local laboratories (e.g. for quicker pre-dose response assessment or \nassessment of toxicity) of protocol-required lab assessments are acceptable; however it \nis important that the sample for the central laboratory analysis is taken at the same \ntime.  Since absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, peripheral blood lymphocytes, \nand hemoglobin results are required to establish if a bendamustine dose reduction \nand/or treatment delay is required, the results of each of these local laboratory tests \nmust also be entered into the eCRF if it is used to manage a dose delay or dose \nreduction.

Some paragraphs were \ntruncated in the following examples.  Specific changes are not shown for every section.  \nSpecific changes are shown for some sections to highlight extent of change.  These specific \nchanges were implemented throughout the protocol even though not shown in this section.  \nThe final protocol and not this appendix must always be followed when implementing the \nprotocol rather these appendices.\nExample:\nSection:\nThroughout Document\nOriginal text:\nPatient\nText changed to:\nSubject\nRationale for Change:\nFor consistent use of terminology throughout the document.  Amended in appropriate \ndocument sections.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 185\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nSections:\nProtocol Summary \nText changed to:\nObjectives\nThe primary objective of the study is to test whether the ofatumumab and bendamustine \ncombination therapy will improve disease progression-free survival in subjects with indolent \nB-cell NHLwho had stable disease to, or progressed during or within 6 months of the end \nof a rituximab or rituximab-containing regimen that did not respond (stable disease or \nprogressive disease) to rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen during or within 6 \nmonths of the last rituximab treatment.\nSecondary objectives evaluate clinical benefit, changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL) \nmeasures, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory prognostic markers in \nsubjects treated with ofatumumab and bendamustine, and ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in \nsubjects receiving ofatumumab alone after disease progression.\nStudy Design\nScreening assessments include physical exam, vital signs, biochemistry, and blood samples.  \nBlood samples (hematology), vital signs, and biochemistry samples are taken throughout the \ntreatment phase.  Follow-up assessments begin on Day 336 (3 months after Day 252), then \nevery 3 months for 2 years, and every 6 months for 3 years according to Appendix 1 and \nAppendix 2.  In the event of PD, Survival Follow-Up visits begin 2 months after PD is \nconfirmed by CT scan.  A bone marrow examination is required to confirm Complete \nRemission (CR) when a subject fulfills the complete response criteria, based on the Revised \nResponse Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma definition of a CR if the subject had bone \nmarrow involvement at baseline.  CT imaging is required for confirmation of all responses \n(CR, PR, SD, PD).  During this study, CT imaging of the neck (when lesion is palpable), \nthorax, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed at baseline, and on Days 84, 168, and 252 (+7 \ndays), regardless of the number of completed cycles of therapy in Arm A and Arm B.\nA total of 256 events in a sample size of 304 evaluable subjects (152 subjects per arm) are \nneeded for the study to have a 90% power to detect a 50% improvement in progression-free \nsurvival (PFS) between study arms.  Assuming a dropout rate of 10 12%, the total sample size \nrandomized for both arms combined will be 338 346 subjects, with approximate study \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 186\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nduration of 68 69 months.  Assuming a screening failure rate of 1015%, the total number of \nsubjects screened will be approximately 376 408.\nSection 3.1.7\nText changed to:\nKnown and Exploratory Prognostic Markers Correlating with Response\n\uf0b7\nBaseline FLIPI-1 and FLIPI-2 scoresBaseline Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC)\n\uf0b7\nGenetic variation in FcR gamma 3A\n\uf0b7\nHuman Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA)\nRationale for Change:\nSummary updated to reflect changes in the document.\nSection 1.2:\nFrontline Treatment\nText changed to:\nBendamustine hydrochloride (RIBOMUSTIN) is currently approved in Germany (i.e., 60 \nmg/m\u00b2 I.V. on days 1-5, vincristine 2 mg I.V. on day 1, prednisone 100 mg/m\u00b2 I.V. on \ndays 1-5; cycle repeated after 3 weeks) for the primary treatment of advanced, indolent \nNHL in combination regimens and as a single agent or combination therapy for multiple \nmyeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [RIBOMUSTIN Prescribing \nInformation Package Insert, 2009; LEVACT SPC, 2010]. Approval for indolent NHL that \nrelapsed during or within 6 months of receiving a rituximab-containing regimen is pending in\nEurope and Japan. Bendamustine is approved for indolent NHL that relapsed during or \nwithin 6 months of receiving a rituximab-containing regimen. In the US, bendamustine \nhydrochloride (TREANDA) as a single agent is also approved for the treatment of CLL and \nrituximab-refractory indolent NHL [TREANDA Package Insert, 2010].\nRationale for Change:\nLevact approved in EU.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 187\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nSection 1.3:\nOfatumumab\nText changed to:\nThe pivotal trial Study Hx-CD20-406 in subjects with fludarabine-refractory CLL [refractory \nto both fludarabine and alemtuzumab (n=59) or refractory to fludarabine and with bulky \nlymphadenopathy for whom alemtuzumab is not suitable (n=79)] evaluated 300 mg + 7 x \n2000 mg for eight weekly doses, followed by four monthly 2000 mg doses.  An The \ninvestigator-determined overall objective response rate of patients refractory to \nfludarabine and alemtuzumab was 58 42% with a median duration of response of 6.5 \nmonths consisting of partial responses (PR) was achieved in the fludarabine and \nalemtuzumab refractory group with a median progression-free survival of 5.7 months.  The \nbest response was PR.  Similarly, in the bulky fludarabine refractory group with a similar \nunmet medical need, an objective response rate of 47% was achieved, including 1 complete \nresponse (CR), with all other responses being partial responses (PR).  The median PFS in the \nbulky fludarabine refractory group was 5.9 months.  In this study, ofatumumab was generally \nwell tolerated.  Specifically, in the DR group, Tthe most frequently reported adverse events \n(>15% frequency) were pyrexia, diarrhea, fatigue, cough, neutropenia, anemia and pneumonia.\nRationale for Change:\nResults updated.\nSection 2 Objectives:\nSecondary objectives:\nText changed to:\n\uf0b7\nTo evaluate ofatumumab pharmacokinetics when ofatumumab is given with as \nmonotherapy to subjects who progress during or following single-agent\nbendamustine\nRationale for change:\nPharmacokinetic objective is removed from the main body of the study; this objective is being \naddressed appropriately in another study.  This study will assess ofatumumab \npharmacokinetics in subjects in Arm B who receive ofatumumab monotherapy after disease \nprogression.\nSection 3.1:\nStudy Design\nText changed to:\nThe primary analysis of progression-free survival will use 90% power to detect a 50% \ntreatment effect; a 13.5 vs. 9 month improvement in Arm A (ofatumumab and bendamustine \ncombination therapy) vs. Arm B (bendamustine monotherapy). A total of 256 events will be \nrequired in a sample size approximately 304 subjects (152 subjects per arm). With an \nestimated accrural rate of 6 subjects per month, the study treatment duration wil be \napproximately 62 months. However, to meet an assumed 10% drop out rate, 338 subjet will \nbe randomized to the study. The study duration increases to approximately 68 months. It is \nalso estimated that approximately 10 % of subjects screened may fail screening criteria; \ntherefore, approximately 376 subjects may be screened for this study to obtain 338\nrandomized subjects. This trial is an event-driven study design with an event-driven \nsample size of 256 total events and the final analysis will take place at the time of \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 188\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\noccurrence of the 256th event. The guideline for the study reaching 256 total events with \nrespect to previously stated assumptions involve screening of 376 408 subjects so as to \nhave 338 346 subjects randomized and to have a study duration of about 62 69 months \nfrom the first day of first subject until the time of the 256th event.\nRationale for Change:\nScreen failure rate and dropout rate updated to reflect current study status.\nSection 3.1.1:\nScreening Phase\nText changed to:\nBaseline Bone Marrow Sample:\nTwo types of bone marrow samples will be accepted:\n1. An historical bone marrow biopsy sample (obtained at any time prior to study entry) \nmay be used to fulfill the study\u2019s needs if:\n\u2022\nThe bone marrow biopsy showed involvement by lymphoma and\n\u2022\nThe subject has received no lymphoma therapy in the intervening time period.\n2.\nA study specific (screening) sample will be required if any of the following \npoints are met: \n1.\nThe subject has no previous bone marrow biopsy, or\n2.\nThe bone marrow biopsy was taken >1 month prior to randomization and \nshowed no involvement by lymphoma, or \n3. The subject has received lymphoma therapy in the intervening time period \nsince the prior bone marrow biopsy. \nA screening bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be required if a prior bone marrow biopsy \nand aspirate results from the previous \uf0a38 weeks cannot be provided.\n4.\nA bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be required at screening if results are not \navailable from a prior bone marrow aspirate and biopsy performed within 8 weeks \nprior to randomization. Results may be provided in the form of a bone marrow \nbiopsy report when a previous aspirate and biopsy are not available as long as the \nreport was based on the biopsy done within 8 weeks prior to randomization.  Results \nmay be provided in the form of a bone marrow biopsy report when a previous \naspirate and biopsy are not available as long as the report was based on the biopsy \ndone within 8 weeks prior to randomization.  If the investigator has clinical suspicion \nthat the protocol candidate has transformed to Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma \n(DLBCL), the investigator should not consider that subject for the trial unless a \nlymph node biopsy is performed.  To confirm that disease has not transformed to a \nDLBCL, an incisional or excisional lymph node biopsy of accessible adenopathy is \nhighly recommended.  In less accessible lymph nodes, 4 to 8 core biopsies are \nrecommended, but not required.\nLymph Node Biopsy if Transformation to DLBCL Is Suspected:\nIf the investigator has clinical suspicion that the protocol candidate has transformed to Diffuse \nLarge B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the investigator should not consider that subject for the \ntrial unless a lymph node biopsy is performed.  To confirm that disease has not transformed to \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 189\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\na DLBCL, an incisional or excisional lymph node biopsy of accessible adenopathy is highly \nrecommended.  In less accessible lymph nodes, 4 to 8 core biopsies are recommended, but not \nrequired.\n\uf0b7\nBone marrow aspirate, biopsy and lymph node pathology report including details \nconfirming CD20+ tumor status will be sent along with tissue or slides for central \nreview.  Please see SPM for more details.\nReview of Materials:\nBone marrow biopsy and tissue pathology report (including details on core and aspirate, \ncore alone, or aspirate only) including details confirming CD20+ tumor status will be \nsent along with tissue or slides for central review.  Please see SPM for more details.  \nBlood samples, physical examination, and whole body CT imaging (with contrast imaging of \nthe neck when lesion is palpable, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis; may be whole body CT scan \nor according to standard of care) will be provided to determine baseline disease and study \neligibility (See Imaging Acquisition Guidelines). All examinations should be must be \nperformed \u2264 14 21 days prior to randomization with the exception of the CT imaging and \nbone marrow biopsy and aspirate as mentioned above.  CT imaging done \uf0a31 month prior to \nrandomization may be used as the baseline CT scan.  If the investigator would wants to use a \nCT scan done >1 month prior to randomization, the medical monitor may be contacted to \ndetermine if CT scan can be accepted.\nRationale for Change:\nClarification.\nSection 3.1.1.1 Documentation of Indolent B-cell NHL that is stable or has \nprogressed during or within six month of the end of treatment \nwith rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen\nText changed to:\nA documentation worksheet verifying the investigator\u2019s diagnosis of stable disease following, \nor progression of indolent B-cell NHL during or within 6 months of treatment with rituximab \nor a rituximab-containing regimen will be required at screening.  This documentation \nworksheet must be sent to GSK prior to randomization and will ask for:\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 190\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nInformation about last rituximab therapy:\n\uf0b7\nDates before and dates after last rituximab-containing regimen\n\uf0b7\nType of rituximab therapy and regimen (examples: weekly, monthly):\no\nRituximab (includes monotherapy and maintenance), or\no\nRituximab added to chemotherapy\n\uf0b7\nDate and type of response associated with last rituximab-containing regimen\n\uf0b7\nInformation regarding imaging:\n\uf0b7\nCopy of the imaging report prior to last rituximab-containing regimen is required (if \navailable)\n\uf0b7\nCopy of documentation confirming PD (for example, an imaging report, clinical \ndocumentation) after subject deemed unresponsive or relapsed to rituximab-based \nregimen is required\nRationale for Change:\nObvious progression could be documented using methods other than imaging.  As long as \nthese other methods/documentation can show progression, they may be used to confirm \nrituximab refractory disease.\nSection 3.1.4:\nTreatment Phase\nText changed to:\n\uf0b7\nArm A: Up to 8 cycles of bendamustine (90 mg/m2, Days 1, 2; q21 days) in \ncombination with 12 doses of ofatumumab (1000 mg).  Beginning in Cycle 2, \nofatumumab will be given on Day 1 (or within 3 days after Day 1) of each cycle of \nbendamustine as long as subjects in Arm A receive bendamustine.  Once subjects in \nArm A complete bendamustine therapy, the remaining doses of ofatumumab will be \ngiven monthly, q28 days (on or 3 days after Day 1 of each month) until all 12 doses \nare completed.  Administer the first dose of ofatumumab monotherapy 28 days \nafter Day 1 of the last cycle where combination (ofatumumab+bendamustine) \nwas scheduled to be given.\n\uf0b7\nArm B:  Up to 8 cycles of bendamustine (120 mg/m2, on or 3 days after Days 1, 2; \nq21 days.).\nSubjects in Arm B who cannot complete 8 cycles the planned therapy (in Arm A and Arm \nB) must still come in for all planned visits and assessments (Visits 1-20) according to the \nschedule presented in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2.  Also see SPM for more details.  Subjects \nin Arm A and Arm B are required to come for all planned CT scans with corresponding \nassessments for these days (Days 84, 168, 252; \u00b17 +7 days).\nRationale for Change:\nClarification.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 191\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nSection 3.1.5:\nFollow-up Phase\nText changed to:\nFollowing study treatment, subjects who have CR, PR or SD will receive regular follow-up \nfor 5 years in Arm A.  The last required CT scan will be done on Month 54 (Table 1).  \nUnscheduled CT scans will be required in addition to the scheduled CT scans if there \nare clinical signs or suspicion of progression throughout the study.  Arm B will also \nfollow this schedule if Arm B subjects do not select ofatumumab monotherapy.\nTable 1\nFollow-up visit schedule and CT scan requirements\nF/U phase1\nCT scan3\n3 M F/U 12\nRequired\n6 M F/U 1\nRequired\n9 M F/U 1\nRequired\n12 M F/U 1\nRequired\n15 M F/U 1\nRequired\n18 M F/U 1\nRequired\n30 M F/U 2\nRequired\n42 M F/U 2\nRequired\n54 M F/U 2\nRequired\n60 M F/U 2\nNot required3\nAbbreviations:  Follow-Up 1= F/U 1; Follow-Up 2= F/U 2; Month= M\n7.\nThis schedule is for F/U 1, F/U 2, and the Survival F/U. \n8.\nThe 3 M F/U 1 visit occurs 336 days after randomization (or 3 months after Day 252) in Arm A and Arm B \n(Appendix 1, Appendix 2).  This 3 M F/U 1 visit occurs 3 months after last ofatumumab monotherapy dose for \nsubjects with PD in Arm B who select ofatumumab monotherapy (Appendix 3).\n9.\nCT scans are required during scheduled F/U 1 and F/U 2 visits with the last required CT scan on Month 54.  CT \nscans will be required to confirm clinical signs or suspicion of progression if observed outside scheduled F/U 1 \nand F/U 2 visits.  CT scans are not required for Survival F/U.\nFollow-up assessments begin on Day 336 (3 months after Day 252), then according to \nAppendix 1 and Appendix 2 (also see SPM).  In the event of PD, Survival Follow-Up \nvisits begin 2 months after PD is confirmed by CT scan.  Follow-up visits will begin on \nDay 336 (this is 3 months after Day 252) and then continue every 3 months for 2 years, then \nevery 6 months for 3 years.Each follow-up visit and assessment will have a time window of \n\u00b17 days for Follow-Up Visit #1 and a time window of \u00b114 days for Follow-Up Visit #2.  \nFollow-up visits will include collection of survival status, concomitant medications, and \nresponse assessments, based on RRCML.  Survival follow-up visits may be phone calls \ninstead of physician office visits. In addition, subjects will be monitored for safety, efficacy, \nand pharmacokinetics as described.  See Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for a complete list of \nfollow-up procedures. \nIf a subject in Arm B decides to receive ofatumumab monotherapy following PD, they will \nnot follow the schedule described in Section 3.1.5, Appendix 1 and Appendix 2, but will be \nmonitored according to the follow-up schedule described in Section 3.1.6, Appendix 3, and \nTable 1 (where 3 month F/U begins 3 months after last dose of ofatumumab).\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 192\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nRationale for Change:\nFollow -up frequency (including CT scans required within these visits) were reduced to \naddresss UK Ethics feedback on the protocol.  The UK Ethics Committee asked that we \nreduce the number of CT scans in this study.  As long as subjects remain on a consistent \nfollow up schedule, there is no risk for this new schedule to interfere with data analysis.\nSection 3.1.5:\nFollow-up for Progressive Disease\nText changed to:\nA PD Worksheet will be completed following the CT scan.  Instructions for this \nworksheet are found in the SPM.  \nSurvival Ffollow-up visits will begin on Day 336 (this is 3 months after Day 252) 2 months \nafter PD is confirmed by CT scan as described in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 and Table \n1 and continue every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.  Each follow-\nup visit will have a time window of \u00b17 days for Follow-Up Visit #1 and a time window of \n\u00b114 days for Follow-Up Visit #2.One month is defined as having 28 days.  Each follow up \nvisit and assessment will have a time window of \u00b17 days. Survival follow-up visits may be a \nphone call instead of physician office visit.  \nRationale for Change:\nTo synchronize follow-up visits after the date of progression in all subjects.\nSection 3.1.6:\nOfatumumab Following Progressive Disease for Arm B\nText changed to:\nA PD Worksheet must be completed once the decision to begin ofatumumab \nmonotherapy following PD in Arm B is taken (See SPM for details).\nThe first follow-up visit will occur one month following the last infusion of ofatumumab \nmonotherapy and continue every 3 months for 2 years then every 6 months for 3 years as \ndescribed in Appendix 3 and Table 1.\nText changed to:\nClarification and reflects change in documentation requirements.\nSection 4.2:\nInclusion Criteria\nText changed to:\nInclusion #1:  Small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic, marginal zone lymphoma, and \nfollicular lymphoma (FL); grades 1, 2 and 3A, defined according to WHO guidelines.\n\uf0b7\nTumor verified to be CD20+ positive from a previous or current lymph \nnode tissue biopsy.  A bone marrow biopsy is not sufficient for tissue \ndiagnosis.\n\uf0b7\nCT imaging in screening phase (based on local evaluation) showing  2 or \nmore clearly demarcated lesions with a largest diameter \u2265>1.5 cm and \nshort axis \u2265 1.0 cm, or 1 clearly demarcated lesion/node with a long axis \nlargest diameter \u2265>2.0 cm and short axis \u2265 1.0 cm.  CT imaging \nperformed at screening as baseline image.\nInclusion #2:  Indolent B-cell NHL with failure to achieve at least a partial response \nlasting 6 months beyond the of treatment with that remains stable or unresponsive during \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 193\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nor within 6 months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (See \nSection 6.2.5.4- Section 6.2.5.5 for details on response criteria), i.e.:\n\uf0b7\nStable disease after rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (imaging will \nsupport this finding. NOTE: in cases of stable disease after rituximab \nmonotherapy as induction treatment, the minimum time to confirm stable \ndisease by imaging is 60 days from start of first rituximab infusion)\nor, \n\uf0b7\n\u00b7Disease progression during or within 6 months of treatment with rituximab or \na rituximab-containing regimen. Imaging must support this finding and will be \ndone \u2264 6 months after the last infusion of rituximab. \n\uf0b7\nMaintaining stable disease or failure to achieve PR to rituximab-based therapy. \n(Imaging will support this finding, and will be performed at least 60 days after the \nlast dose of rituximab-based therapy)\n\uf0b7\nor,\n\uf0b7\ndisease progression while on rituximab-based therapy (e.g., includes 4 weekly \ncourses of rituximab given at 6-month intervals [Hainsworth, 2005])\n\uf0b7\nor,\n\uf0b7\ndisease progression in subjects with stable disease or better response to rituximab-\nbased therapy <6 months of the last dose of rituximab\nNote:  Subjects must have received a minimum of 4 rituximab infusions as monotherapy or 3 \ninfusions as part of rituximab-containing combination regimens\nRationale for Change:\nInclusion Criterion #1:  CD20 staining can be accurately determined from non-lymph node \ntissue (such as bone marrow or splenic tissue). Some patients with splenic marginal zone \nlymphoma may have disease which is primarily non-nodal (or have nodes which are not easily \naccessed), and this change allows such patients to be considered for this study.\nInclusion Criterion #2:  Clarification to accommodate local practices.  Extra examples were\nunnecessary to convey criterion.  \nSection 4.3:\nExclusion Criteria\nText changed to:\nExclusion Criterion #2:  Previous autologous stem cell transplant or fludarabine therapy, or \nradioimmunotherapy in the last 6 months or previous allogeneic stem cell transplant at any \ntime\nPrior Exclusion Criterion #4: Previous external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis.  \nPrevious external beam radiation therapy for bony disease to the cranium, mediastinum, and \naxilla or to more than 3 vertebral bodies\nExclusion Criterion #3:  High dose steroids \u2265 100 mg prednisone/day (or equivalent) for 7 \nconsecutive days, given as concomitant medication, within 3 months prior to \nrandomization. No more than 10 mg prednisone daily at the time of randomization\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 194\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nExclusion Criterion #4:  Prior bendamustine treatment within 1 year of randomization \nnot resulting in a CR or PR for at least 6 months\nExclusion Criterion #5: Prior use of any monoclonal antibody (other than CD20) within 3 \nmonths prior to randomization\nPrior Exclusion Criterion #7:  Prior treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, if 1st\ndose was administered within 60 days prior to randomization. Prior use of any monoclonal \nantibody (other than anti-CD20) within 3 months prior to randomization\nRationale for Changes:\nNo longer excludes fludarabine and radioimmunotherapy:\n\uf0b7\nPrevious concern was that prior fludarabine and RI would deplete BM reserve.  We \nwanted BM reserve to recover from these prior therapies before subjects entered the \nOMB110918 study, since bendamustine is myelosuppressive.  Since the inclusion and \nexclusion criteria already require minimum hematological values to safeguard against \nsubjects at increased risk of hematologic toxicity from bendamustine, exclusion of prior \nfludarabine and radioimmunotherapy is not necessary.\nNo longer exclude previous external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis, previous external \nbeam radiation therapy for bony disease to the cranium, mediastinum, and axilla or to more \nthan 3 vertebral bodies:\n\uf0b7\nPrevious concern was that extensive radiation therapy would reduce marrow reserve.  We \nwant adequate BM reserve for subjects in the OMB110918 study, since bendamustine is \nmyelosuppressive.  Since the I/E criteria already require minimum hematological values \nto safeguard against subjects at increased risk of hematologic toxicity from bendamustine, \nexclusion of patients based on the amount of prior radiation is not necessary.\nRemoved Exclusion criterion restricting anti-CD20 antibody within the last 60 days:\n\uf0b7\nSince rituximab is included in virtually all treatment regimens for indolent B-NHL and \nrefractory patients often have clinically aggressive disease that requires treatment, it is \nnot medically feasible to require patients to wait 60 days to begin new therapy if they do \nnot respond to their last therapy.\nSection 4.4:\nWithdrawal Criteria\nText added:\nEntire section updated.\nRationale for Change:\nClarification:  text added to explain the difference between \u201cWithdrawal from Investigational \nProduct\u201d vs \u201cWithdrawal from study\u201d.\nSection 5.1.1:\nPre-Medication, Table footnote\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 195\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nText changed to:\nPre-Medication Schedule\nInfusion Number\n30 minutes to 2 hours prior to treatment\nAcetaminophen (PO) ~1000 \nmg or equivalent\nAntihistamine (IV or PO) \nequivalent to ~50 mg \ndiphenhydramine\nGlucocorticoid (IV) \nequivalent to ~50 mg \nprednisolone\n1st\nX\nX\nX\n>11\nX1\nX1\nX1\n5.\nAdministration of steroid premedication in Arm A (and in Arm B, as applicable) will be at investigator discretion if \nsevere infusion reactions did not occur during first infusion.\nRationale for Change:\nCorrection.\nSection 5.1.3:\nBendamustine\nText added:\nBendamustine will be given for up to 8 cycles in both Arm A and Arm B.  However, in \nthe following instances, bendamustine may be given for fewer than 8 cycles:\n\uf0b7\nIf a subject cannot tolerate bendamustine and is unable to receive further \ntreatment with bendamustine, the subject may stop bendamustine treatment.  \n\uf0b7If this occurs in Arm A:  the subject will continue to receive all 12 doses of \nofatumumab and continue to attend all scheduled visits on Day 1.  Day 2 visits are \nnot required unless the investigator requires additional tests.\n\uf0b7If this occurs in Arm B:  the subject will continue to attend all scheduled visits.  \nNote:  Subjects will only be required to attend the equivalent of the Day 1 visit.  The \nDay 2 visit is not required unless assessed as necessary by the Investigator.\n6.\nThe number of cycles will be contingent upon the response to the first 4 cycles.  \nSubjects achieving CR after 4 cycles in either Arm will be treated with a total of 6 \ncycles only, whereas, all other subjects will receive 8 courses of bendamustine as \nmonotherapy (Arm B) or in combination with ofatumumab (Arm A).  \n2. If this occurs in Arm A:  the subject should continue to receive all 12 \ndoses of ofatumumab and continue to attend all scheduled visits\n3. If this occurs in Arm B:  the subject should continue to attend all \nscheduled visits on Day 1 of each cycle\n7.\nSubjects with progressive disease at any time during bendamustine \nmonotherapy (Arm B) or OB combination therapy (Arm A) will be taken off \ntreatment and will continue with survival follow-up (Section 3.1.6 describes \nsubjects with PD in Arm B that continue on to ofatumumab monotherapy).\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 196\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nThe initial cycle length or dose of bendamustine in Arm A may be lowered on \nrecommendation of the IDMC after evaluation of data from the dose confirmation cohorts.  \nDetailed instructions for dose reduction and subsequent dose reductions will be in the IDMC \ncharter and summarized in Section 9.7.\nBendamustine may be initiated within 1 day of scheduled start for logistical reasons.  Once \nthe first infusion occurs, the second infusion should occur the following day.  The start of \nCycles 2-8 may be delayed due to toxicity by up to 2 weeks for medical reasons at the \ninvestigator\u2019s discretion.  \nRationale for Change:\nClarification.\nSection 5.1.3.1:\nBendamustine Dose Reduction\nText added:\nGeneral Dosing Considerations for Arm A and Arm B:\n\uf0b7\nDelay treatment for Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or clinically significant \u2265Grade 3 non-\nhematologic toxicity.\n\uf0b7\nToxicities must recover to Grade 1 or baseline before the next administration of treatment. \nIf recovery is not met within 2 weeks after the prescribed start of the treatment cycle (i.e., \nafter a 2 week delay), a decision will be made about continuation in the study following \nconsultation with medical monitor.\n\uf0b7\nBendamustine dosage will be delayed in subjects with a serum creatinine > 1.5 \nULN if the calculated creatinine clearance [Cockcroft, 1976] or creatinine \nclearance from a 24-hour urine collection is \u226440 mL/min.\n\uf0b7\nSubjects should be monitored for safety as per local practice.\n\uf0b7\nThe protocol should be followed as closely as possible, but if as per local \npractice, a blood draw for hematology analysis prior to the visit date is required, \nit would be acceptable for hematology analysis, but the blood draw can be taken \nno more than 3 days ahead of the visit date.  Blood draws performed by local \nlaboratories (e.g. for quicker pre-dose response assessment or assessment of \ntoxicity) of protocol-required lab assessments are acceptable; however, it is \nimportant that the sample for the central laboratory analysis is taken at the \nsame time.  The local laboratory results of absolute neutrophil count, platelet \ncount, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and hemoglobin must also be entered into \nthe eCRF if it is used for a treatment decision.  Central Laboratory data will \nalso be entered into the eCRF.\nRationale for Changes:\nTaken from Treanda Prescribing Information and added to protocol for clarity.  Also added \nclarification of when and how local laboratory tests may be used in this study.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 197\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nSection 6.1.9:\nVital Signs\nText added:\nVital signs including temperature, blood pressure (BP), and pulse are documented per \nAppendix 1 and Appendix 3, at screening and for the remainder of the study in both arms. \nTemperatures for individual subjects must be measured using the same method at all visits.\nAll subjects must be monitored as per standard of care for changes in blood pressure, \nheart rate, and temperature and for Adverse Events. All recorded values should be \ndocumented in the subject\u2019s source documentation.\nIf the subject suffers an adverse event (Grade \u22651) during the infusion (including \nasymptomatic fever, hypotension or tachycardia), which is determined by the \nInvestigator to be related to either the study procedures or study treatment, vital sign \nmeasurements (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) should be recorded in \nappropriate source documentation AND the blood pressure and heart rate recorded in \nthe INFORM eCRF system, for the following time-points:\n\uf0b7\nAt the time of event onset.\n\uf0b7\nThen every 30 minutes, or more frequently if clinically indicated, if in the \nInvestigator\u2019s opinion the vital sign results at the time of event onset are \nclinically significant. The subject\u2019s vital sign measurements should continue to \nbe recorded until they have returned to normal or pre-infusion levels.\nRationale for Change:\nSimplification of instructions.\nSection 6.2.2:\nCT Scans\nText changed to:\nWhole body CT scans (with contrast of the neck when lesion is palpable, thorax, abdomen, \npelvis, may be whole body CT scan or according to standard of care) will be done as part \nof the efficacy evaluation and after treatment has been completed.  The scans must be \nimplemented according to a CT scan manual to be provided to GSK (Imaging Acquisition \nGuidelines) as mentioned in the SPM.\nIn situations where progressive disease is apparent through physical examination (such as \nmassive lymphadenopathy), only the body area where progressive disease is apparent must be \nscanned to confirm progressive disease.\nAll subjects (Arm A and Arm B) must have a CT scan done on Days 84, 168, and 252 (\u00b17 +7 \ndays).  In the event subjects in Arm B cannot complete 8 cycles of therapy then subjects must \ncome to the clinic for all scheduled visits.  Subjects will have CT scans at each follow-up visit\nas described in Table 1, Appendix 1, and Appendix 3.  Survival Follow-up visits will \nbegin 2 months after PD is confirmed by CT scan.  CT scans will be done to confirm any \nclinical signs or suspicion of PD.  CT scans which are unscheduled and are performed to \nconfirm PD in event of clinical signs or suspicion of progression may be done only of the \nsuspected body area with progression.  In the event that an unscheduled CT scan does \nNOT show PD, the subject will resume the planned CT scan schedule (i.e. the next CT \nscan will be done based on the date of the last scheduled CT scan and not the day of the \nunscheduled CT scan).  For all other responses, follow-up visits will begin on Day 336 \n(this is 3 months after Day 252) for both arms and continue during follow-up visits, or until \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 198\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\ninitiation of alternative indolent lymphoma treatment, PD, or withdrawal (WD), See \nAppendix 1 and Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 for details.  One month is defined as having 28 \ndays.\nCT scans will be assessed according to an independent review.  The independent review will \nbe described in an independent review charter.  See Section 6.2.6 for a description of this \nindependent review.\nRationale for Change:\nWhole body CT imaging is not done at all sites.  All change were made to accommodate \ndifferent global local practices.  Instructions for CT scans in the event of clinical signs of \nprogression were added.\nSection 6.2.3:\nBone Marrow Examination\nText changed to:\nBone marrow examination (both aspirate smear and biopsy core, if possible) to confirm CR, \nas determined by the clinical and laboratory results listed in Section 6.2.5.2 is required no \nlater than \uf0a38 weeks following onset of CR if there was disease involvement in the bone \nmarrow at baseline.  Samples are to be reviewed in conjunction with the prior pathology. \nRationale for Change:\nClarification on what is needed for study.\nSection 6.2.5:\nDocumentation of Target and Non-target Lesions\nText changed to:\nEligibility Criterion\nCT scan showing at least:\n\uf0b7\n2 or more clearly demarcated lesions/nodes with a long axis >1.5 cm and short axis \n\uf0b31.0cm and not previously irradiated\nOR\n\uf0b7\n1 clearly demarcated lesion/node with a long axis >2.0 cm and short axis \uf0b31.0cm and \nnot previously irradiated.\nRationale for Change:\nIf a patient who failed radiation therapy and a lesion which has been previously irradiated is \nthe primary site of disease progression, an investigator should be allowed to use that lesion to \nmeasure response to study therapy without compromising study response.\nSection 6.3.2:\nPeripheral Blood Sampling for Hematology and \nBiochemistry\nText changed to:\n\uf0b7\nBiochemistry:  sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, blood urea nitrogen \n(BUN), creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin*, alkaline phosphatase (ALP),  aspartate \ntransaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH),  \nalbumin, glucose (random), and haptoglobulin.  \no\n*bBilirubin fractionation is recommended if total bilirubin >2 x ULN\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 199\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\n\uf0b7\nA creatinine clearance will be calculated prior to bendamustine administration as \nshown in Appendix 2.  Calculated creatinine clearance will be done at screening \nand can be repeated at the physician\u2019s discretion if there is a significant rise in \nserum creatinine during the treatment phase of the study.  The Cockcroft-Gault \nformula [Cockcroft, 1976] will be used to determine a calculated creatinine clearance:\nRationale for Change:\nClarification.\nSection 6.3.3:\nPrognostic Factors\nText changed to:\n\uf0b7\nGenetic variation in the FcR gamma 3A\n\uf0b7\nHuman Anti-Chimeric Antibody (HACA) will be taken as defined in Appendix 2.  \nIf receiving ofatumumab following PD in Arm B, HACA will be taken as defined \nin Appendix 3\n\uf0b7\nHACA\nRationale for Change:\nClarification on the type of FcR gamma 3 A test.\nSection 6.3.4:\nPeripheral Blood Sampling for Safety and Disease \nStatus\nText changed to:\n\uf0b7\nHepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) at screening.  Subjects receiving \nofatumumab that are Hepatitis B core positive at screening, Hepatitis B DNA should\nwill be obtained at each cycle visit while on treatment and then at 1,3,6 months post \ntreatment.  See SPM for more details.\n\uf0b7\nHuman Anti-Chimeric Antibody (HACA) will be taken as defined in Appendix 2.  If \nreceiving ofatumumab following PD in Arm B, HACA will be taken as defined in \nAppendix 3\nRationale for Change:\nHACA schedule changed and clarification of hepatitis testing.\nSection 6.4.1:\nLiver Chemistry/Stopping and Follow-up Criteria\nThis entire section was updated.  See protocol text.\nRationale for Change:\nModified to align to the stopping criteria which has been adopted for all ofatumumab studies \nbased upon the FDA July 2009 Guidance for Industry, Drug-Induced Liver Injury:  Pre-\nmarketing Clinical Evaluation, Section 5, Decision to Stop Drug Administration. Because \ntransient elevations in LFTs may be due to tumor lysis which is of clinical benefit, disease \nrelated liver involvement or due to other chemotherapy rather than drug induced liver injury \nfrom ofatumumab, the protocol was modified to allow re-challenge with investigational \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 200\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nproduct. Any decision to restart therapy after interruption must be determined by the \ninvestigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor and the GCSP assigned physician.\nSection 6.5.1:\nDefinition of an AE\nText added:\nEvents that do not meet the definition of an AE include:\n\uf0b7\nEvents related to the underlying lymphoma and unrelated to the study therapy, \nunless more severe than expected for the condition\nRationale for Change:\nClarification.\nSection 6.5.7:\nTime Period and Frequency of Detecting AEs and SAEs\nText changed to:\nAll SAEs and AEs regardless of relationship to investigational product will be collected from \nthe first dose of investigational product to 60 days after the last dose of investigational \nproduct and will be documented on the eCRF.  Only SAEs, regardless of causality, will be \nreported from 60 days 61 Days after the last dose of treatment to the end of the follow-up \nperiod\nFrom the time a subject consents to participate in and completes the study (See Section 4.4), \nall SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol-mandated procedures, \ninvasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to GSK concomitant medication, will \nbe reported promptly to GSK as indicated in Table 8.\nSAEs will not be reported after subsequent anti-NHL therapy is initiated.\nRationale for Change:\nClarification and instructions on SAE reporting after NHL therapy.\nSection 6.7:\nOfatumumab Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection\nEntire section updated.\nRationale for Change:\nRemoval of the pharmacokinetic objective in the main body of the study resulted in the \nremoval of the ofatumumab sample collection in subjects in Arm A related to the assessment \nof ofatumumab pharmacokinetics. The rationale for the removal of the objective is that it is \nbeing addressed appropriately in another study.\nAddition of more extensive HAHA surveillance resulted in the addition of ofatumumab \nsample collection in both Arm A subjects and Arm B subjects who received ofatumumab after \ndisease progression related to that surveillance.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 201\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nSection 8.3.5.1:\nEfficacy Analyses\nOther Secondary Analyses\nText changed to:\n\uf0b7\nHuman Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA)\n\uf0b7\nHACA results prior to ofatumumab administration will be listed. The number of \npatients with positive HACA in the predose samples will be reported\n\uf0b7\nHuman Anti-Human Antibodies (HAHA)\n\uf0b7\nThe change in HAHA titers from predose to post-baseline visits and the number and \nproportion of positive and negative results at each visit will be provided in patients \nwho receive ofatumumab.  HAHA results and associated ofatumumab plasma \nconcentration at each time point will be listed.\nRationale for Change:\nReflects updates in HACA sampling and assessments and planned reporting of HAHA results.\nSection 8.3.5.4:\nPharmacokinetic Analyses\nThe plasma concentrations for individual subjects will be determined using validated \nanalytical methods for ofatumumab.  Plasma ofatumumab concentration-time data will be \nsummarized and displayed in tabular and graphical form separately for subjects in Arm A and \nfor subjects in Arm B who receive ofatumumab following progressive disease.  Individual \nplasma concentrations of ofatumumab will be listed.\nPopulation pharmacokinetic modeling, using non-linear mixed effects modeling will be \nperformed on the data for subjects in Arm B who receive ofatumumab following \nprogressive disease using validated software such as the computer program NONMEM, if \ndata permit.  Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for analysis.  \nThe aims of this modeling approach are to:  \n\uf0b7\nDefine the structural pharmacokinetic model that characterizes the population time course \nof plasma levels of ofatumumab in this patient population\n\uf0b7\nDescribe between-subject variability for pharmacokinetic parameter estimates\n\uf0b7\nEstimate intra-subject variability on predicted concentrations\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 202\nAmended Protocol Version 11 Clean\nProtocol No. COMB157E2301/OMB110918\nIf possible, the effects of subject characteristics (such as gender, weight, height, disease status, \netc.) will be investigated in order to account for potential sources of inter-individual \nvariability in systemic exposure.  If there are sufficient data for analysis, the details of the \npopulation pharmacokinetic analyses will be provided in a reporting and analysis plan.\nRationale for change:\nRemoval of the pharmacokinetic objective from the main body of the study.\nSection 8.3.5.5:\nPharmacokinetic Analyses\nSection removed:\n analyses will be performed to determine any potential relationships between \nofatumumab pharmacokinetics or exposure and B-cell monitoring results or other clinical \n endpoints, data permitting.  If appropriate, data from all subjects will be \npooled and analyzed using a population approach.

At the same time as the IA, a Futility Analysis (FA) will also occur and an\nIndependent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review the data.  Based on the IDMC \nreview of the data available the IDMC will recommend that the study continue without any \nchanges, be stopped to further enrollment, or be terminated.\nRationale for Change:\nAn IA and a futility analysis have been added.  The IA may also allow for an earlier detection \nof clinical benefit to patients with the ofatumumab and bendamustine combination.   The \npurpose the IA is to review accumulating safety and efficacy data and to also provide an \nopportunity to terminate the study if there is strong evidence that the ofatumumab and \nbendamustine combination will fail to show superiority if the study is allowed to run to its \nplanned completion (stopping for futility).  \nSection 3.1: INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN - Study Design\nOriginal Text:\nPrimary Analysis\nThe primary analysis of PFS will use 90% power to detect a 50% treatment effect; a 13.5 vs. 9 \nmonth improvement in Arm A (ofatumumab and bendamustine combination therapy) vs. Arm \nB (bendamustine monotherapy).
