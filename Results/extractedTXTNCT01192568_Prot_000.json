Patients will be enrolled into the 6-week placebo-controlled \ntreatment followed by an 8-week open-label treatment phase.\n\uf0b7\nPost-Amendment 3: An open-label treatment study. Patients will be enrolled in a 6-week \nopen-label treatment phase. A portion of enrolled patients will receive an additional \n8 weeks of open-label treatment for a total of 14 weeks of open-label treatment.\nPrimary Objectives:\nThe primary objectives are:\n\uf0b7\nPre-Amendment 3: To evaluate the efficacy of daily treatment with oxybutynin chloride \ngel compared to placebo in pediatric patients during the first 6 weeks of a 14-week \ntreatment period.\n\uf0b7\nPost-amendment 3: To evaluate the efficacy of daily treatment with oxybutynin chloride \ngel in pediatric patients during the first 6-weeks of a 14-week open-label treatment \nperiod.\nSecondary Objectives (for Pre-Amendment 3 and Post-Amendment 3):\nThe secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and \nskin tolerability of oxybutynin chloride gel in pediatric patients.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 10 of 74\nStudy Design:\nThis study was initiated as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label \nextension, and amended to enroll patients under only open-label treatment. Prior to Amendment \n3, patients aged 6 years to < 17 years were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive double-blind \noxybutynin chloride gel or placebo gel for 6 weeks, followed by an open-label, 8-week period to \ngenerate safety data. All patients began treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day for 2 weeks. Patients \nthen returned to the clinic for a potential dose titration and at this time their dose could have been \nadjusted up to 1 g/day, down to 0.5 g/day, or remained the same at 0.75 g/day. The determination \nof dose was based on the investigator\u2019s clinical judgment and assessment of the patient\u2019s bladder \nsymptoms and treatment side effects. Dose titration was permitted only once during the entire \n6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period. Patients continued blinded treatment for \n4 additional weeks until the end of the double-blind treatment period.\nPost-Amendment 3, the study dose-titration study in pediatric patients, ages 3 years to \n< 17 years, with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition. Efforts will be \nmade to enroll a greater number of patients from the ages of 3 years to < 6 years. Patients must \nbe suitable candidates for anticholinergic therapy and must be using clean intermittent \ncatheterization (CIC) for bladder control. The study will include a screening period from Day -13 \nto Day -5 and a 14-week open-label treatment period. The expected duration of the study for \neach patient will be up to 16 weeks. No changes were made in the starting dose, compared to the \nPre-Amendment 3 study design, in that all patients will begin treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day \nfor 2 weeks. Patients will then return to the clinic for a potential dose titration and at this time \ntheir dose may be adjusted up to 1 g/day, down to 0.5 g/day, or remain the same at 0.75 g/day, \ndepending on individual response and tolerability. The determination of dose will be based on the \ninvestigator\u2019s clinical judgment and assessment of the patient\u2019s bladder symptoms and treatment \nside effects. Dose titration will be permitted only once during the entire 14-week treatment \nperiod. Patients will continue the adjusted dose for 12 additional weeks until the end of the \nopen-label treatment period.\nSafety will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, \nclinical laboratory evaluations, skin erythema at the application site, and a vision symptom \nquestionnaire.\nStudy Population:\nPre-Amendment 3 included pediatric patients, from ages 6 years to < 17 years, who had a \ndiagnosis of detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition and were using CIC \nto control bladder function. These patients were enrolled into the 6-week placebo-controlled \ntreatment plus an 8-week open-label treatment phase of the study. Post\u2011Amendment 3 enrollment \nwill include pediatric patients from ages 3 years to < 17 years, who have a diagnosis of detrusor \noveractivity associated with a neurological condition and are using CIC to control bladder \nfunction, with an enrollment of a minimum of 25 patients. These patients will be enrolled in a \n14-week open-label treatment phase (approximately 10 patients are expected to complete the \n14 weeks).\nTest Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:\nOxybutynin chloride gel, 0.5 g, 0.75 g (starting dose for Pre- and Post-Amendment 3), or 1 g \nsachets, applied transdermally once daily to dry intact skin.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10%

It has shown efficacy, safety, and tolerability in the treatment of both adult and \npediatric patients. Oxybutynin is currently available for use in adults as immediate- and \nextended-release oral formulations, syrup, transdermal delivery systems (TDS), and as \noxybutynin chloride gel (Gelnique\u00ae).\nOxybutynin chloride gel is formulated as a clear, colorless hydroalcoholic gel, available in a \n1 gram unit dose that contains 100 mg oxybutynin chloride. This topical formulation was \ndesigned to provide the convenience of a once-a-day dosage form with decreased anticholinergic \nside effects compared to oral oxybutynin products and improved skin tolerability relative to the \noxybutynin TDS (Oxytrol\u00ae).\nPhase 1 investigations evaluating the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of oxybutynin chloride \ngel demonstrated that the gel provided sustained systemic delivery of therapeutic levels of \noxybutynin.1 In a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in adults, application of 1 g of oxybutynin \nchloride gel produced comparable oxybutynin absorption and plasma concentration profiles to \n3.9 mg/day of Oxytrol transdermal administration.1 The application of oxybutynin chloride gel\nto different anatomical sites (abdomen, thighs, and upper arms/shoulders) resulted in similar \noxybutynin absorption from all of the sites.2\nA Phase 3 study showed that oxybutynin chloride gel was effective in treating the symptoms of \noveractive bladder in adults and results from the same study indicated that the gel was safe and \nwell tolerated, with improved skin tolerability over oxybutynin transdermal systems.3\nNeurogenic bladder is a condition characterized by overactivity of both the detrusor and \nsphincter muscles resulting in incontinence, urinary retention, and bladder infections. The vast \nmajority of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in the pediatric population is the result of a \nmyelomeningocele.4 When not treated adequately this condition will eventually impact the health \nof the kidneys.4 Available data demonstrate that pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity \nassociated with a neurological condition may benefit from improved bladder control with \nanticholinergic treatment.5,6\nThis Phase 4 study is being undertaken to provide information on the safety and efficacy of \noxybutynin chloride gel in pediatric patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. In a \npreviously conducted Phase 4 clinical study, children with neurogenic bladder were treated with \noxybutynin TDS.7 This study demonstrated that treatment with either 2.6 mg/day or 3.9 mg/day \noxybutynin TDS improved the symptoms of detrusor overactivity and the urodynamic \nparatmers.7 Oxybutynin and N-desethyloxybutynin (DEO) metabolite plasma concentrations in \nthese pediatric patients did not differ significantly from those observed in adults administered \nOxytrol (3.9 mg/day), suggesting comparable oxybutynin chloride bioavailability and \nmetabolism in adults and children.7 Therefore, the proposed doses of 0.5 g, 0.75 g, and 1 g \noxybutynin chloride gel are in the range of oxybutynin TDS doses previously evaluated and \nshown to be safe and effective in this pediatric population.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 22 of 74\nThe current standard of treatment is a combination of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) \nand an anticholinergic agent, such as oxybutynin.6 This combination has shown statistically \nsignificant and clinically meaningful changes from baseline in catheterization urine volume, as \nwell as improvements in the percentage of catheterizations without leakage and in key \nurodynamic parameters.8 These same clinical and urodynamic parameters will be used in the \npresent study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride gel when administered \nto pediatric patients.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 23 of 74\n8\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES\n8.1\nPrimary Objectives\nThe primary objectives of this study are:\n\uf0b7\nPre-amendment 3: To evaluate the efficacy of daily treatment with oxybutynin chloride gel \ncompared to placebo in pediatric patients during the first 6 weeks of a 14-week treatment \nperiod.\n\uf0b7\nPost-amendment 3: To evaluate the efficacy of daily treatment with oxybutynin chloride gel \nin pediatric patients during the first 6-weeks of a 14-week open-label treatment period.\n8.2\nSecondary Objectives\nThe secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, \nsafety, and skin tolerability of oxybutynin chloride gel in pediatric patients.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 24 of 74\n9\nINVESTIGATIONAL PLAN\n9.1\nOverall Study Design and Plan\nThis study was initiated as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label \nextension, and is now amended to continuing to enroll patients under only open-label \ntreatment.\nPre-Amendment 3, patients ages 6 to >17 years, were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive double-\nblind oxybutynin chloride gel or placebo gel for 6 weeks, followed by an open-label, 8-week \nperiod to generate safety data. All patients began treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day for 2 weeks. \nPatients then returned to the clinic for a potential dose titration and at this time their dose \ncould have been adjusted up to 1 g/day, down to 0.5 g/day, or remained the same at 0.75 g/day. \nThe determination of dose was based on the investigator\u2019s clinical judgment and assessment of \nthe patient\u2019s bladder symptoms and treatment side effects.\nDose titration was permitted only once during the entire 6-week double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled period. Patients continued blinded treatment for 4 additional weeks until the end of \nthe double-blind treatment period. Pre-Amendment 3, visits were identified numerically \n(ie, Visit 1 through Visit 8/Early Termination).\nPost-Amendment 3, this study will continue as an open-label study for new patients enrolled \nunder the present protocol (Amendment 3), with a similar patient population (ie, pediatric \npatients who have been diagnosed with detrusor overactivity that is associated with a \nneurogenic condition) and will also enroll younger patients (minimum age of 3 years).\nFor patients enrolled under Post-Amendment 3, this will be a multicenter, open-label, dose-\ntitration study in pediatric patients, ages 3 years to < 17 years, who have been diagnosed with \ndetrusor overactivity that is associated with a neurogenic condition. Patients must be suitable \ncandidates for anticholinergic therapy and must be using CIC for bladder control. No changes \nwere made in the starting dose, compared to the Pre-Amendment 3 study design, in that all \npatients will begin treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day for 2 weeks. Patients will then return to the \nclinic for a potential dose titration and at this time their dose may be adjusted up to 1 g/day, \ndown to 0.5 g/day, or remain the same at 0.75 g/day, depending on individual response and \ntolerability. The determination of dose will be based on the investigator\u2019s clinical judgment \nand assessment of the patient\u2019s bladder symptoms and treatment side effects. Dose titration \nwill be permitted only once during the entire 14-week treatment period. Patients will continue \nthe adjusted dose for 12 additional weeks until the end of the open-label treatment period. \nPost-Amendment 3, visits will be identified alphabetically (ie, Visit A through Visit F/ET).\nIn the Post-Amendment 3 study design (open-label treatment only), the study will consist of a \nscreening period from Day -13 to Day -5 and a 14 week open-label treatment period. The total \nstudy duration for each patient will be approximately 16 weeks.\nThe screening period will include 1 clinic visit; Visit A (Screening Visit), where patients will be \nconsidered for inclusion in the study. Following Visit A, all patients taking anticholinergic \nmedications will be asked to discontinue treatment and complete a 3-day washout period (11-day \nwashout period if the patient was previously taking solifenacin). In addition, patients will be \nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 27 of 74\n9.3.2 Exclusion Criteria\nPatient will be excluded from participation if they meet any of the following criteria:\nEX01.

If a patient < 8 years old has known risk factors for eye \ndisease before starting treatment (ie, family history of pediatric eye disease and/or \nsymptoms of a vision disorder) it will be recommended, at the discretion of the \ninvestigator, that a comprehensive eye examination is performed by a pediatric \nophthalmologist prior to enrollment.\n9.3.3 Patient Identification\nPatient study identification numbers will be assigned at the Screening Visit. Patient numbers will \nbe consecutive at each study site beginning with 001. Patient numbers will consist of the site \nnumber (3 digits) followed by the patient number (3 digits) at that site. Patient identification \nnumbers will be used throughout the trial.\n9.3.4 Removal of Patients from Treatment or Assessment\nAn attempt will be made to identify and follow every patient enrolled in the study through to \ncompletion. If a patient withdraws, or is withdrawn from the study by the investigator, the reason \nand circumstances for such early termination must be fully documented.\nPatients may be withdrawn from treatment for the occurrence of a serious adverse event (SAE) \nor any other condition that may create a safety risk. The sponsor must be informed within 48 \nhours if any patient withdraws from the study regardless of cause. Patients who are withdrawn \nfrom the study may not be re-enrolled.\n9.4\nStudy Treatments\n9.4.1 Treatments Administered\nPre-Amendment 3, patients were randomized to receive oxybutynin chloride gel or placebo \nduring the 6-week double-blind treatment period, and all patients received oxybutynin chloride \ngel during the 8-week open-label treatment period. Patients randomized to double- blind \noxybutynin chloride gel started treatment at 0.75 g/day, and the dose may have been adjusted \nafter 2 weeks of treatment to a higher or lower dose (0.5 g/day or 1 g/day) based on the \ninvestigator\u2019s clinical judgment and assessment of bladder symptoms and treatment side \neffects. All patients who entered the open-label safety period were started on 0.75 g/day \noxybutynin chloride gel, and the dose may have been adjusted after 2 weeks of treatment as \ndescribed for the double-blind treatment period.\nPost-Amendment 3, no changes were made in the starting dose, compared to the \nPre-Amendment 3 study design, in that all patients will begin treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day \nfor 2 weeks. Patients will then return to the clinic for a potential dose titration and at this time \ntheir dose may be adjusted up to 1 g/day, down to 0.5 g/day, or remain the same at 0.75 g/day, \ndepending on individual response and tolerability. The determination of dose will be based on \nthe investigator\u2019s clinical judgment and assessment of the patient\u2019s bladder symptoms and \ntreatment side effects. Dose titration will be permitted only once during the entire 14-week \ntreatment period. Patients will continue the adjusted dose for 12 additional weeks until the end \nof the open-label treatment period.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 29 of 74\nPatients or parents/caregiver will apply the gel each morning to rotating application sites on the \nabdomen, upper arms/shoulders, and thighs. The person who applies the gel should wash his or \nher hands immediately after application with soap and water.\nPatients should not bathe or shower sooner than 1 hour following a gel application. In the event \nof direct contact between unwashed or unclothed skin to which gel has been applied and the skin \nof another person, the contact area on the other person should be washed with soap and water as \nsoon as possible.\n9.4.2 Identity of Study Treatment\n9.4.2.1\nDescription of Study Treatment\nOxybutynin chloride gel is a pH 6.0 clear, colorless, hydroalcoholic gel containing 100 mg of \noxybutynin hydrochloride salt per gram of gel. Each gram is designed to deliver approximately \n4 mg oxybutynin to the systemic circulation. Inactive ingredients are alcohol, USP; glycerin, \nUSP; hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF; sodium hydroxide, NF; and purified water, USP. The 0.5 g, \n0.75 g, and 1 g doses are of identical composition and differ only in the amount of gel applied.\nThe study treatment is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice \nand will be distributed to study centers by the sponsor.\n9.4.2.2\nPackaging, Labeling, and Dispensing\nThe study treatment will be packaged in individual patient cartons containing a sufficient supply \nof sachets for the completion of the treatment period, plus an additional amount for supplies that \nare mishandled. Each patient carton will be color-coded by dose level (0.5, 0.75, or 1 g). The \ngel will be supplied as individually pouched 0.5 g, 0.75 g, and 1 g dose sachets of the active gel. \nEach sachet will be labeled with the protocol number, study treatment identification (ID), \ncontents, caution statement (Caution: New Drug \u2013 Limited by Federal Law to Investigational \nUse) and the sponsor\u2019s name and address. These labeled sachets will be packaged in visit cartons \nto be dispensed to patients at their clinic visits. Two-part labels will be attached to each visit \ncarton: one part will remain on the container and one will be detached when the container is \ndispensed to the study patient. The carton will be labeled with the protocol number, medication \nID, contents, caution statement, the sponsor\u2019s name and address, and directions to apply \ncontents of 1 sachet daily as directed. Immediately before dispensing the study treatment, the \nInvestigator will write the patient\u2019s 6-digit identification number, patient\u2019s initials, and date \ndispensed on the label. The detachable portion will contain the dosing information for each \npatient (ie, the starting dose of 0.75 g/day, or a later modified dose level of 0.5 or 1 g/day). \nDosing information will be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).\n9.4.2.3\nStorage and Accountability\nThe study treatment will be stored in a secure location at controlled room temperature, 20\u00b0C to \n25\u00b0C/68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F (with excursions allowed between 15\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C/59\u00b0F and 86\u00b0F) and away \nfrom direct sunlight.\nThe investigator shall maintain accurate study treatment inventory records, including the \nquantities and date of receipt of supplies from the sponsor, and the quantities and dates of \ndispensing to study participants.

All unused supplies shall \nbe returned to the sponsor or, if authorized in writing by the sponsor, destroyed properly at the \nstudy site. Shipping and handling of all study treatment will conform to FDA regulations for \ninvestigational drug products.\nReasons for departure from the expected dispensing regimen will also be recorded. At \ncompletion of the study, to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all \nstudy treatment supplies will be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and destroyed or returned to the \nsponsor according to applicable state and federal regulations. A written explanation must be \nprovided for any discrepancies. The study monitor must review all records of investigational \nsupplies prior to the return or destruction of any study treatment.\n9.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups\nPre-Amendment 3, patients were randomized to oxybutynin chloride gel or placebo treatment in \na 1:1 ratio within each stratification level, using an interactive voice recognition system (IVRS). \nEnrollment was stratified based on sex, age, and weight. Stratification was done within the \nfollowing groups: male and female; 6 to < 12 years-of-age and 12 to < 17 years-of-age; and \n\u226425.0 kg and > 25.0 kg for the 6 to < 12 years-of-age group and \u2264 50.0 kg and > 50.0 kg for the \n12 to < 17 years-of age group.\nPost-Amendment 3, no changes were made in the starting dose, compared to the Pre-\nAmendment 3 study design, in that all patients will begin treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day for \n2 weeks. Patients will then return to the clinic for a potential dose titration and at this time \ntheir dose may be adjusted up to 1 g/day, down to 0.5 g/day, or remain the same at 0.75 g/day, \ndepending on individual response and tolerability. All patients will be assigned to oxybutynin \nchloride gel; patient enrollment will not be stratified.\n9.4.4 Selection of Doses and Timing of Administration in the Study\nPre-Amendment 3, patients were randomized to receive oxybutynin chloride gel or placebo \nduring the 6-week double-blind treatment period, and all patients received oxybutynin chloride \ngel during the 8-week open-label treatment period. Patients randomized to double-blind \noxybutynin chloride gel started treatment at 0.75 g/day, and the dose may have been adjusted \nafter 2 weeks of treatment to a higher or lower dose (0.5 g/day or 1 g/day) based on the \ninvestigator\u2019s clinical judgment and assessment of bladder symptoms and treatment side \neffects. All patients who entered the open-label safety period were started on 0.75 g/day \noxybutynin chloride gel, and the dose may have been adjusted after 2 weeks of treatment as\ndescribed for the double-blind treatment period.\nPost-Amendment 3, no changes were made in the starting dose, compared to the \nPre-Amendment 3 study design, in that all patients will begin treatment with 0.75 g of gel/day \nfor 2 weeks. Patients will then return to the clinic for a potential dose titration and at this time \ntheir dose may be adjusted up to 1 g/day, down to 0.5 g/day, or remain the same at 0.75 g/day, \ndepending on individual response and tolerability. The determination of dose will be based on \nthe investigator\u2019s clinical judgment and assessment of the patient\u2019s bladder symptoms and \ntreatment side effects.

Compliance will be assessed and \nrecorded at each clinic visit and for the overall study.\n9.5\nStudy Activities\nThe following sections (Sections 9.5.1 to 9.5.4) provide details of the study activities \nPost-Amendment 3 (ie, only open-label enrollment). Note that alterations from prior details \nare shown in bold italics and are further enumerated in the accompanying Summary of \nChanges document. A schedule of events table is presented in Section 15, Appendix 1.\n9.5.1 Screening Period (5 to 13 Days)\nThe screening period will occur from Day -13 to Day -5 and will include 1 clinic visit, Visit A\n(Screening Visit), where patients will be considered for inclusion in the study. Following Visit A, \nall patients taking anticholinergic medications will be asked to complete a 3-day minimum \nwashout period (11-day washout period if the patient was previously taking solifenacin). \nFollowing the washout period, patients (or parents/caregivers) will complete a 2-day urinary \ndiary on 2 consecutive days, prior to Visit B. To minimize off-treatment time, patients may \ncomplete the washout period and urinary diary as close to Visit B as possible. All evaluations and \nprocedures that will be conducted during the screening period are listed below in Section 9.5.1.1.\n9.5.1.1\nVisit A (Screening Visit)\nSite personnel will perform the following:\n1.\nProvide detailed explanation of the study.\n2.\nObtain informed consent and assent (if applicable)\n3.\nVision screening assessment. Prior to Baseline Visit patients who are < 8 years of age \nat the time of screening who have not had a vision examination in the last 12 months \nprior to screening are required to have a vision assessment prior to or at the baseline \nvisit. The vision assessment can be performed at the study site or a separate site by a \nhealthcare professional [nurse, technician, or physician] with the appropriate \ntraining.\n4.\nAssign 6 \u2013digit identification number using IVRS\nThe following evaluations must be completed before Visit B (Baseline Visit):\n5.\nReview and document pertinent inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n6.\nRecord demographic information (sex, race, ethnicity, and date of birth).\n7.\nObtain medical history, including a history of the patient\u2019s incontinence.\n8.\nObtain prior and current medication use information.\n9.\nMeasure and record height and weight.\n10. Measure and record vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and \ntemperature).\n11. Record output of 12-lead electrocardiogram.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 33 of 74\n12. Conduct physical examination, which will include a review of the following: body as a \nwhole; skin; head, ears, eyes, nose, throat (HEENT); cardiovascular; respiratory; \nmusculoskeletal; neurologic; lymphatic/thyroid; and abdomen.\n13. Collect blood and urine samples for laboratory evaluation, including urinalysis and urine \nculture (Appendix 2).\n14. Collect urine sample for pregnancy test for all females of childbearing potential \n(Appendix 2).\n15. Instruct patients to complete a 3-day minimum washout period, if patients are presently \non anticholinergic or other excluded medication (11-day washout period if the patient \nwas previously taking solifenacin).\n16. Dispense 2-day urinary diary and review instructions for its completion (Appendix 3). \nRemind patients/caregivers that the urinary diary must be completed following the \nwashout period, but prior to scheduled Visit B. The patient/caregiver should not be \ninformed of the minimum diary requirements for eligibility.\n17. Patients < 8 years old who have not had a vision examination in the last 12 months \nprior to screening will require a vision screening assessment prior to or at the \nBaseline Visit (Appendix 8). The vision assessment can be performed at the study site \nor a separate site by a healthcare professional (nurse, technician, or physician) with \nthe appropriate training.\n9.5.2 Open-label Treatment Period (14 Weeks)\nThe 14-week, open-label treatment period will begin at Visit B (Baseline Visit, Week 0 of \ntreatment). Patients should have completed the washout period and the 2-day urinary diary prior \nto Visit B. If patients continue to meet eligibility criteria at Visit B, a urodynamic evaluation will \nbe conducted. All patients will apply 0.75 g of gel daily to rotating sites located on the abdomen, \nupper arms/shoulders, or thighs.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign \n(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally \nassociated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the \nmedicinal product (ICH-E2A).\nFor the purpose of the site\u2019s data collection responsibilities, any untoward event that was \nreported from the patient signed the informed consent form (ICF) until 30 days after the final \nprotocol-defined study visit or, if the final visit does not occur, the last known dose of study \ntreatment is to be considered an AE.\nExamples of AEs are as follows:\n\uf0b7\nChanges in the general condition of the patient\n\uf0b7\nSubjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the patient\n\uf0b7\nObjective signs observed by the investigator or other study site personnel\n\uf0b7\nAll diseases that occur after signing informed consent, including any change in \nseverity or frequency of pre-existing disease\n\uf0b7\nAll clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory values or clinically relevant physical \nfindings that occur during the study schedule\nPlease note that medical procedures scheduled prior to consenting, but occurring during the \nstudy should not be captured as AEs, but should be listed in the medical history if related to a \npre-existing condition.\n9.7.1.1\nCausality Assessment\nFor each AE, the investigator must provide an assessment of causal relationship to the study \ntreatment. The causality assessment must be recorded on the eCRF. Causal relationship must \nbe assessed by answering the following question:\nIs there a reasonable possibility the study treatment caused the event?\nYes: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment and AE, ie:\n\uf0b7\nThere is a reasonable temporal relationship between the study treatment and the event, \nand/or\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 39 of 74\n\uf0b7\nThe event is unlikely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other study \ntreatments, or other factors, and/or\n\uf0b7\nPositive dechallenge and/or rechallenge exist\nNo: There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment and AE, \nie:\n\uf0b7\nThere is no reasonable temporal relationship between the study treatment and the \nevent, or\n\uf0b7\nThe patient did not take the study treatment, or\n\uf0b7\nThe event is likely to be attributed to underlying/concurrent disease, other study \ntreatments, or other factors, or\n\uf0b7\nThe event is commonly occurring in the (study) population independent of study \ntreatment exposure\n9.7.1.2\nSeverity Assessment\nThe investigator will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by recording a severity \nrating on the appropriate page of the patient\u2019s eCRF. Severity, which is a description of the \nintensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness, which implies a patient \noutcome or AE-required treatment measure associated with a threat to life or functionality. \nSeverity will be assessed according to the following scale:\nMild:\nA type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment \nor therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual \nactivities of daily living.\nModerate:\nA type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic \nintervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing \ndiscomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research \nparticipant.\nSevere:\nA type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly \naffects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.\n9.7.1.3\nSerious Adverse Event\nAn SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:\n\uf0b7\nResults in death\n\uf0b7\nIs life threatening\n\uf0b7\nRequires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 40 of 74\n\uf0b7\nResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or\n\uf0b7\nIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect\nImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require \nhospitalization may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they \nmay jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of \nthe outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic \nbronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood \ndyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient hospitalization, or the development of \nstudy treatment dependency or drug abuse.\nEmergency room visits that do not result in hospitalization should be evaluated for one of the \nother serious outcomes to determine whether they qualify as SAEs.\nPreplanned hospitalizations (eg, elective procedures for pre-existing conditions that did not\nworsen, such as cosmetic surgery and hysterectomy) are excluded from SAE reporting.\n9.7.1.4\nReporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events\nAt each visit, patients are to be queried regarding any AEs or SAEs that have occurred since \nthe previous visit. Patients will be asked to volunteer information with a nonleading question \nsuch as, \u201cHow do you feel since your last visit?\u201d Study site personnel will record all pertinent \ninformation in the patient\u2019s eCRF.\nAll AEs must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient\u2019s eCRF whether \nor not they are considered causally related to the study treatment.\nFor every AE, the investigator must:\n\uf0b7\nProvide an assessment of the seriousness of the event (ie, is it an SAE?), as well as the \nseverity and causal relationship\n\uf0b7\nDocument all actions taken with regard to the study treatment\n\uf0b7\nDetail any other treatment measures taken for the AE\n\uf0b7\nDocument the outcome of the AE\nIn addition, patients are to be reminded, as described in the ICF and in accordance with \nSection 9.7.1, to notify site personnel of any AEs occurring during the 30 day post-study \nperiod. Any AEs reported by the patient (or patient representative) during this period are to be \nrecorded in original source documents. AEs are also to be recorded in the eCRF if at least one\nof the following conditions is met: 1) the event meets the criteria for an SAE (see \nSections 9.7.1.3 and 9.7.1.5), and/or 2) the event is judged by the Investigator to be potentially \ncausally related to study treatment.\nAny AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol-defined study visit will be followed \nuntil the condition returns to prestudy status, has resolved or stabilized, or can be explained as \nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 41 of 74\nbeing unrelated to the study treatment.

Therefore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately regarding any SAE that occurs \nafter informed consent is obtained.\nWithin 24 hours of learning of any AE that meets one of the criteria for an SAE, the study site \npersonnel must report the event to AbbVie Global Drug Safety on the SAE Form for Clinical \nTrials. The Sponsor\u2019s Study Physician may also be notified by telephone.\nIf, during follow-up, any nonserious AE worsens and eventually meets the criteria for an SAE, \nthat AE should be recorded as a new SAE.\nThe site must transmit the SAE Form for Clinical Trials to the SAE fax number shown below. \nEven if an initial report is made by telephone, the SAE Form for Clinical Trials completed \nwith all available details must still be faxed within 24 hours of knowledge of the event at the \nstudy site.\nSupplemental information should be submitted as soon as available and may include \nlaboratory results, radiology reports, progress notes, hospital admission and emergency room \nnotes, holding and observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death \ncertificates.\nThe investigator is expected to take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the \nSAE. Any medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on \nthe appropriate pages of the patient\u2019s eCRF. All SAEs are to be followed by the study staff \nuntil resolution or until the SAE is deemed stable. The Sponsor may contact the study site to \nsolicit additional information or follow up on the event.\nFax the SAE Form for Clinical Trials to AbbVie Inc.\nGlobal fax number for SAE or Pregnancy Reporting: \n1-714-796-9504 (backup fax 1-714-246-5295)\nor email it to IR-Clinical-SAE@abbvie.com.\nIn case of fax failure or the site does not receive confirmation of receipt of the fax, the site \nmust email the report to IR-Clinical-SAE@abbvie.com.\nMedical Emergency phone number: 1-800-503-8745\n9.7.1.6\nReporting of Pregnancies Occurring During the Study\nStudy site personnel must report every pregnancy from the time the patient signs the ICF until \n30 days after the last dose of study treatment.

Typically, all \n3 analytes will be obtained from the same sample, but they may come from multiple samples \ntaken within a 24-hour period. This requirement applies from the time he or she signs the ICF \nfor the trial until 30 days after the final protocol-defined study visit or the last known dose of \nstudy treatment (if the final visit does not occur).\nA laboratory alert for potential Hy\u2019s laws cases will be in place and must notify investigators \nand the Sponsor immediately when the above criteria have been met. A potential Hy\u2019s law case \nmust be faxed to the Sponsor on an AE of Special Interest Form as soon as possible (within \n24 hours of learning of the potential Hy\u2019s law) to the SAE/Pregnancy fax number stated in \nSection 9.7.1.5, even if no AE has occurred. The eCRF for potential Hy\u2019s law cases must be \ncompleted within 7 calendar days.

The investigator will evaluate the ECG tracing for \nany clinically significant abnormalities.\n9.8.4 Concomitant Medication Use\nPatients will be queried at each clinic visit concerning the use of medications. Concurrent \nmedications used by the patients will be documented, including the name of the drug, the dose, \nthe frequency, the route of administration, the date of initiation and discontinuation, and the \nreason for the medication.\nGuidelines for prohibited drugs listed in the inclusion/exclusion criteria (Section 9.3.2) are to be \nfollowed.\n9.8.5 Anticholinergic Symptoms Questionnaire\nPatients/caregivers will be asked to complete an anticholinergic symptoms questionnaire at\nVisits 2, 6, and 8 (Pre-Amendment 3) or Visits B, C, D, E, and F (Post-Amendment 3). The \nquestionnaire will ask patients/caregivers to describe the intensity of any side effects that may be \nassociated with the administration of anticholinergic medications (Appendix 5). Adverse events \nassociated with the administration of anticholinergic medications detected on the \nquestionnaire will be reported on the Adverse Event Form. The severity of the event and the \nrelationship to the study drug will be assessed by the investigator and reported on the Adverse \nEvent Form.\n9.8.6 Vision Symptom Questionnaire\nPost-Amendment 3, patients/caregivers will be asked to complete a Vision Symptom \nQuestionnaire at Visits B, C, D, E, and F (Appendix 6). The questionnaire will ask \npatients/caregivers to describe any visual impairment or eye conditions for the patient.\nAdverse events of vision disorders and/or symptoms detected on the Vision Symptom \nQuestionnaire will be reported on the Adverse Event Form. The severity of the event and the \nrelationship to the study drug will be assessed by the investigator and reported on the Adverse \nEvent Form.\nIf a patient < 8 years old has started treatment and develops visual or ophthalmologic \nsymptoms (ie, blurry vision, dry eye, dilated pupils, constant squinting, eyes drifting outward) \nit will be recommended that the patient is referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for a \ncomprehensive eye examination.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 46 of 74\n9.9\nAppropriateness of Measurements\nUrinary diaries are non-invasive tools that provide a record of bladder function in neurogenic and \nnon-neurogenic conditions. The data collected from these diaries give an indication of urinary \npatterns and severity of symptoms. The urinary diary can be used effectively to assess \nimprovement of urinary incontinence during treatment and is an appropriate tool to use in this \nstudy.\nUrodynamic measurements are the gold standard for evaluating bladder and sphincter function \nand for documenting the effectiveness of new drugs and treatment paradigms. Urodynamic data \ncan provide supporting evidence of changes in bladder function following treatment with \nanticholinergics.\nThe safety assessments, including adverse events review, physical examination, vital signs, and \nlaboratory evaluations represent standard evaluations in clinical studies evaluating \nanticholinergic agents. The assessment of skin erythema at the local application site is useful in \ndetermining the irritation potential of transdermal applications, like the oxybutynin topical gel.\nThe sparse blood sampling methodology is appropriate for this pediatric study, to minimize the \namount of blood sampling and for the determination of average oxybutynin and \nN-desethyloxybutynin plasma concentrations.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 47 of 74\n10\nQUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE\nThe sponsor will implement and maintain quality control procedures to ensure that this study is \nconducted, and data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, \nGCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.\nThe sponsor or designee will routinely conduct monitoring and/or auditing visits to the study \ncenters to verify the adherence to the study protocol, the protection of the rights and well- being \nof the patients, and the accuracy and completeness of reported study data recorded on the source \ndocumentation.\nOxybutynin Chloride 10% Gel\nAbbVie Inc.\nStudy: OG09002\nProtocol Amendment 4\n31 October 2022\nConfidential\nPage 48 of 74\n11\nPLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS\n11.1\nDetermination of Sample Size\nSample size was calculated for the protocol as originally designed (Pre-Amendment 3: double-\nblind, placebo-controlled treatment period followed by an open-label extension) as follows:\nThis study was planned to include a minimum of 96 pediatric patients aged 6 to < 17 years who \nhave a diagnosis of detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition. The sample \nsize was selected to provide an adequate number of patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy of \noxybutynin chloride gel treatment in a pediatric population. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 \nfashion to oxybutynin chloride gel or placebo within each stratification level, which were based \non age, weight, and gender. Estimates for the average change from baseline (CFB) in the \npercentage of catheterizations without a leaking accident as well as the standard deviation for \nthis variable were taken from oxybutynin TDS in Study O03010.
