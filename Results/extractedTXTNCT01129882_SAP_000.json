Every 3 months, all of the \nmonthly assessments are completed along with a urine pregnancy test for women of \nchildbearing potential (WOCBP).  Every 6 months, all of the 3-month assessments are \ncompleted along with the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale, vital signs, \nand extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) assessments (including the Abnormal Involuntary \nMovement Scale [AIMS], Simpson-Angus Scale [SAS], and Barnes Akathisia Rating \nScale [BARS]).  At the 12-month visit, all of the 6-month assessments are completed \nalong with clinical laboratory tests and assessments of body weight, height, and waist \ncircumference.  \nUrine drug screening and blood alcohol testing are obtained at baseline and can be re-\nobtained at the investigator\u2019s discretion at any time during the trial.  A Visual Analog \nScale (VAS) for subject-reported rating of pain at the most recent injection site and the \ninvestigator\u2019s assessment for pain, redness, induration, and swelling of the most recent \ninjection site are performed at baseline and may be reassessed at the discretion of the \ninvestigator.  Clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, and electrocardiogram \n(ECG) obtained at baseline may also be performed at the discretion of the investigator \nbased on clinical necessity.  \nA Trial Completion visit or Early Termination visit (\u22122/+10 days) includes the following \nassessments: C-SSRS, AEs, concomitant medications, a urine pregnancy test for \nWOCBP, CGI-S, vital signs, EPS assessments (AIMS, BARS, SAS), clinical laboratory \ntests, and body height and weight.\nA 30-Day Post Treatment Follow-up phone call is made 30 days (\uf0b13 days) after it has \nbeen determined that the subject no longer participates in this trial and includes questions \nabout any AEs that have occurred and any concomitant medications taken since the last \nvisit\nThe subject population is comprised of subjects who have completed Trial 248 and in the \ninvestigator\u2019s judgment may benefit from continued participation in an aripiprazole IM \nDepot trial, in countries where aripiprazole IM Depot is not commercially available. It is \nanticipated that 500 to 800 subjects from estimated 250 sites in trial 248 enroll in this \ntrial.\nProtocol 31-10-270 Statistical Analysis Plan                                                        \nPage 9 of 25\n  Note: The 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month visits include assessments from the previous visit.
