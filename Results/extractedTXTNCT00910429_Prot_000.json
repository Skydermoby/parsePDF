        "Content": "Please see INTRODUCTION of the BAY 11348 (CHEST-1) protocol.In addition, the following aspects should be considered with respect to the long-term extension trial:Based on the currently available scientific evidence, a large proportion of Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) patients who are inoperable or who have a persistent pulmonary hypertension after they underwent pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) cannot be cured. Therefore, it can be assumed that their disease will progress over the years, requiring a long-term medical treatment to maintain their quality of life and to increase their life expectancy.Although the experiences with BAY 63-2521 with respect to the treatment of CTEPH are limited, in the light of the severity of the underlying disease it is justified to offer all patients who participated in the CHEST-1 trial a long-term treatment with BAY 63-2521 (until commercially available).In this context, it should be highlighted that BAY 63-2521 revealed a positive benefit-risk ratio in the trials conducted in Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) patients to date (trials # 11874 and # 12166), allowing continuation of the development program. Moreover, in a first interim analysis of the extension phase of trial # 12166 (includes 21 patients with a BAY 63-2521 treatment up to one year) the improvements in walking distance observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment were sustained without any significant safety concerns.For further information refer to the Investigator Brochure. The Investigator\u2019s Brochure will be updated at regular intervals during the conduct of the trial. New versions of the Investigator\u2019s Brochure will be made available to the investigators without delayIntegrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  Page 7 of 75Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8",

In contrast to that, all patients from the Placebo Arm of the CHEST-1 \ntrial will start at Visit 1 with a BAY 63-2521 dose of 1.0 mg tid.\nTo allow a blinded individual dose titration, the titration will be performed with the \naid of an IVR-System. At each Titration Visit (with the exception of Visit 1) the \ninvestigator should decide, based on the patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure, if the \nstudy medication dose should be modified. The respective decision (increase, \nmaintain or decrease dose) must be entered in the IVR-System that will \nautomatically allocate the right dose in accordance with the respective titration \nscheme. Afterwards, the investigator will be informed by the system, which of the \nblinded medication bottles (blinded with respect to the dose) needs to be handed\nover for the next titration period (starts always with the morning dose).\nIndependently from the patient\u2019s allocation to a specific treatment arm in CHEST-1, \nthe investigators will apply the following blood pressure based titration rules for \ntheir dose decision in CHEST-2:\nThe individual study medication dose of the next titration step will be \ndetermined every 2 weeks according to the peripheral SBP measured at trough \nbefore intake of the morning dose under consideration of the following \nalgorithm (= individual dose titration scheme):\n\uf0b7\nIf trough SBP \uf0b395 mmHg, increase dose (+0.5 mg tid).\n\uf0b7\nIf trough SBP 90 - 94 mmHg, maintain dose.\n\uf0b7\nIf trough SBP <90 mmHg without symptoms of hypotension, reduce dose (-\n0.5 mg tid).\n\uf0b7\nIf any SBP <90 mmHg with clinical symptoms of hypotension such as \ndizziness or presyncope, stop study treatment; restart after 24 hours with \nreduced dose (-0.5 mg tid).\nIntegrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  \nPage 10 of 75\nFinal Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8\nIn general, if the investigator requests an increase or decrease of study medication \ndose via the IVR-System, the subsequent dose modification will not exceed \nplus/minus 0.5 mg study medication.\nAlthough the individual dose titration scheme is solely based on the patient\u2019s \nsystolic blood pressure, investigators are obliged to consider in addition the \npatient\u2019s well being. Therefore, it is allowed in case of study medication side \neffects, to suspend a foreseen up-titration step and to maintain the dose.\nTo request an increase of study medication dose is only possible at the planned \nstudy visits Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 4.\nThe Titration Phase ends at day 56 (Visit 5). At this visit the actual dose of the \npatients will be unblinded by the IVR-System.\nPatients from the CHEST-1 Placebo Arm:\nFor patients from the CHEST-1 Placebo Arm the starting dose will be 1 mg \nBAY 63-2521 tid. The individual BAY 63-2521 dose will be titrated every 2 weeks \naccording to the peripheral SBP measured at trough before intake of the next \nmorning dose. At the end of the Titration Phase (Visit 5) patients will have reached \nBAY 63-2521 doses between 0.5 mg tid and 2.5 mg tid.\nIntegrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  \nPage 11 of 75\nFinal Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8\nPatients from the CHEST-1 Individual Dose Titration Arm:\nPatients from the BAY 63-2521 Individual Dose Titration Arm of the CHEST-1 \nstudy will enter the extension trial on the same dose which they have received on the \nlast day of CHEST-1 (Visit 7). Although the investigator will apply during the \nTitration phase the same titration rules as for the CHEST-1 placebo patients, the \nindividual dose cannot be increased above the dose received at last day of CHEST-1.\nIf the investigator requests a dose increase above that level via the IVR-System, the \npatient will undergo a sham titration. Nevertheless, in case that the investigator \nrequests a dose decrease (eg for safety reasons), dose modifications are possible, but \nwithout a subsequent re-increase before Visit 5.\nMain-Study Phase (Duration until BAY 63-2521 receives official approval and \nwill be commercially available):\nFrom Visit 5 on (begin of the Main-Study Phase) investigators are allowed to \nmodify the BAY 63-2521 dose in a dose range between 0.5 mg tid and 2.5 mg tid \naccording to the patient\u2019s need. In contrast to the Titration Phase, patients may be \nup-titrated between regular schedule visits.

Such drugs may significantly \nincrease BAY 63-2521 plasma concentrations. In this context, dose reduction of \nBAY 63-2521 should be considered (eg \u2013 0.5 mg tid), in particular if the patient \nsuffers a clinical relevant decrease in blood pressure (eg systolic blood pressure <90 \nmmHg with clinical symptoms). For further information refer to the Investigator \nBrochure.\nAntacids like aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (eg Maaloxan \u00ae) should \nnot be taken simultaneously with BAY 63-2521, because a negative impact on the \nbioavailability of the study drug has been observed (please refer to the Investigator \nBrochure). To avoid such kind of interaction, antacids should be taken 1 hour after \nintake of BAY 63-2521 at the earliest.\nPre- and co-treatment with Omeprazole led to a decrease in BAY 63-2521 \nbioavailability, indicating a lower bioavailability of BAY 63-2521 in neutral versus \nacidic milieu (for further information refer to the Investigator Brochure).\nPreliminary inspection of trough and peak plasma concentrations of BAY 63-2521 \nand BAY 60-4552 (Main BAY 63-2521 metabolite) in a cohort of patients treated \nwith bosentan (n=6) compared to the patients not treated with bosentan (n=66) \nclearly indicate a decrease in BAY 63-2521/BAY 60-4552 plasma exposure, most \nprobably due to the known CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing effects of concomitant \nbosentan. However, patients treated with bosentan profited in about the same \nIntegrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  \nPage 43 of 75\nFinal Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8\nmagnitude in the 6 minute walk test as patients in the therapy na\u00efve cohort did (for \nfurther information refer to the Investigator Brochure, trial 12166).\nThe BAY 63-2521 clearance was increased in smokers compared to non-smokers in \na previous trial in patients with pulmonary hypertension (IMP 12166; see IB for \nmore information). Therefore, patients should report their smoking status to the \ninvestigator.\nDue to the pharmacological mode of action of a guanylate cyclase stimulator, \ntreatment with BAY 63-2521 may unmask existing Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive \ndisease (PVOD), leading to pulmonary congestion and subsequent pulmonary \nedema. Given the severity of the underlying disease this effect may be life-\nthreatening. Clinical symptoms of uncovering of a PVOD may occur weeks to \nmonths after start of treatment with BAY 63-2521. Should signs of pulmonary \nedema occur when BAY 63-2521 is administered, the possibility of associated \nPVOD should be considered and BAY 63-2521\nshould be discontinued \nimmediately.\nThe following undesirable effects of the compound have been observed in clinical \ntrials: decrease in blood pressure (in healthy volunteers mainly diastolic blood \npressure), postural hypotension, dizziness, syncope, increase in heart rate, nasal \ncongestion, feeling hot, headache, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, gastritis, flushing, \nand hyperhidrosis (refer to the Investigator Brochure). Most of the undesirable \neffects are caused by the vasodilators mode of action of the drug. The effects of the \ncompound on smooth muscles may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms (eg dilation of \nthe esophageal sphincter with heartburn, esophagitis and dysphagia; diarrhea; \nconstipation).\nIn addition, the possibility of hitherto unforeseen side effects and allergic reactions \nto drugs, which can result in severe damage and even death, must always be \nconsidered.\nIntegrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/11349  \nPage 44 of 75\nFinal Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8\nAny new, relevant information about adverse drug reactions of BAY 63-2521 will \nbe given to the patients (verbally and in writing).\nInadvertent overdosing with total daily BAY 63-2521 doses of 9 mg (13 and \n32 days), 22.5 mg (14 and 15 days), and 25 mg (2 days) was reported for 5 subjects, \nwhich was tolerated without any adverse events (for further information refer to the \nInvestigator Brochure).\nOverdosage following administration of BAY 63-2521 should be treated as \nclinically indicated. There is no known antidote to BAY 63-2521.\nDue to the pharmacological profile of BAY 63-2521, cardiovascular effects as \ndescribed in the Investigator Brochure (Section 5.3.3.3) may be expected in case of \noverdose.\nIf symptoms develop after the investigational drug has been administered, any \ntherapy that becomes necessary has to be guided by the predominant symptoms. \nPatients have to remain under medical supervision until all relevant adverse effects \nhave subsided. If adverse events occur, the investigator has to decide whether or not \nto remove the patient from the trial (refer to Section 4.3). Emergency drugs and \nequipment has to be available to provide any treatment, which may become \nnecessary.\nIn case of overdose, general measures to prevent absorption (eg, gastric lavage, \nactivated charcoal) should to be taken.\nNote: To keep the investigators up-to-date regarding any kind of safety relevant \ninformation the Development Core Safety Information (DCSI), which is an \nappendix of the Investigators\u2019 brochure, will be updated at regular intervals during \nthe conduct of the trial. New versions of the investigator\u2019s brochure will be made \navailable to the investigators without delay.\n",
