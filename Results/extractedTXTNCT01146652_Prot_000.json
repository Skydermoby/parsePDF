In addition the patients will continue to \nbe treated beyond 264 weeks until sarilumab is commercially \navailable in their country or until 2020 at the latest when the study \nwill be closed. (In the UK the duration of treatment will be 264 weeks \nfrom the first study drug administration in LTS11210). At the time of \ninclusion in this long-term extension, patients may have been \nexposed to sarilumab or placebo or active comparator for 2 to 52 \nweeks, depending on the study in which they were initially included. \nThe sarilumab dose is reduced to 150 mg q2w in case of \nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or an increase in liver enzymes \n(alanine aminotransferase (ALT).  \nA 12-week optional sub-study to evaluate the usability of pre-filled \nsyringe with safety system (PFS-S) will be conducted in some \ncountries. Patients in selected sites in those countries may be \noffered the opportunity to participate in this PFS-S sub-study.  \nSTUDY POPULATION  \nMain selection criteria: \nInclusion criteria \nPatients with RA who were randomized:  \n\u2022 in the study EFC11072 (a randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled study in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who \nare inadequate responders to MTX therapy) \n- \nand who have completed Part A (12 weeks) or Part B \n(52 weeks) of the study EFC11072. \n- \nor patients randomized in Part B of EFC11072 to a \ntreatment arm subsequently not retained following \npivotal dose selection. \n\u2022 in the study ACT11575 and completed the treatment period. \n\u2022 in the study EFC10832 \n- \nand completed the 24-week study treatment period. \n- \nor patients from 12 weeks onward with per protocol-\ndefined  lack of efficacy \n\u2022 in the study SFY13370 and completed the treatment period \n\u2022 in the study EFC13752 and completed the treatment period  \nExclusion criteria \n\u2212 \nPatients with any adverse event leading to permanent \nstudy drug (active or placebo) discontinuation in a prior \nstudy \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 4 \n \n\u2212 \nPatients with an abnormality(ies) or adverse event(s) that \nper investigator judgment would adversely affect \nparticipation of the patient in the study \nTotal expected number of patients: \nMaximum number of patients = Approximately 2000 patients. \nExpected number of sites: \nApproximately 400 sites \nSTUDY TREATMENT(s) \n \nInvestigational Medicinal Product(s) \n \nFormulation \nSarilumab (anti-Interleukin 6R\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (Anti-IL6R\u03b1 \nmAb)   \nTwo different pharmaceutical forms are used in the study: C1F2 \nused in vials and C2F3 (pivotal formulation) used in prefilled \nsyringes. \nBefore Phase 3 pivotal dose selection decision:  vials 150 mg \n(75 mg/ml)  \nAfter Phase 3 pivotal dose selection decision, and prior to \navailability of prefilled syringes: vials 150 mg (75 mg/mL), and \n200 mg (100 mg/mL)  \nAfter Phase 3 pivotal dose selection decision, upon availability \nof prefilled syringes:   prefilled syringes filled with 150 mg \n(131.6 mg/ml) or 200 mg (175 mg/ml) of drug product \nIn the sub-study: prefilled syringes with a needle safety shield \n(PFS-S) with exactly the same IMP formulation as the PFS used in \nthe main study  \nRoute(s) of administration: \nSubcutaneous (SC) injection in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm \nInjection volume: 2 mL (vials);

the sarilumab dose is \n200 mg q2w and the reduced dose is 150 mg q2w.  \nNote: Patients enrolled in the study prior to the dose selection \ndecision and receiving 150 mg qw were switched to 200 mg q2w. \nPatients who prior to the dose selection decision were assigned to \nthe step-down dose of 150 mg q2w because of a safety issue \ncontinued to receive sarilumab 150 mg q2w. \nNoninvestigational Medicinal Products \n(except EFC13752 patients) \nOne or a combination of non-biologic disease modifying drugs \n(DMARDs). \nFolic/Folinic acid in patients using MTX. \nFormulation, route of administration and dose regimen should follow \nthe applicable local labeling information. \nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY \nENDPOINT(S) \n \nPrimary endpoint:  \nSafety assessment of sarilumab over time. \nSecondary Endpoint(s): \n\u2022 \nThe proportion of patients who achieve American College \nof Rheumatology criteria ACR20/ACR50/ACR70, DAS28 \n(Disease activity score) Remission, and EULAR (European \nLeague against Rheumatism) Response over time. \n\u2022 \nDAS28-CRP over time \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 5 \n \n\u2022 \nHAQ-Dl (Health assessment questionnaire \u2013 Disability \nindex) results over time. \n\u2022 \nVan der Heijde modified total Sharp score over time and \nincidence of radiographic progression of the van der Heijde \nmodified total Sharp score for the subset of patients who \npreviously completed study EFC11072, Part B (Cohort 2 \nand Cohort 1 selected dose arms).  \n\u2022 \nEach component of the ACR over time. \n\u2022 \nHealth economic endpoints and Patient reported \noutcomes: patients will continue in evaluation of the health \neconomic endpoints as per the initial study.  \nASSESSMENT SCHEDULE \nThe last visit (EOT visit) of EFC11072, ACT11575, EFC10832, \nSFY13370, or EFC13752 will be used as the initial LTS11210 visit. \nAll patients who agree to participate in the LTS11210 will need to \nsign a new informed consent form specific for this study.  At D1, after \nconfirmation of eligibility, patients will be enrolled in the LTS11210 \nstudy.  \nPatients will have site visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12, then every \n12 weeks until the 2nd year of treatment in the study (Week 96). \nAfter 2 years of study participation, safety assessment and \nlaboratory tests will take place at 24-week intervals. In addition, there \nwill be visits at 24-week intervals in between regular study visits for \ndistribution of IMP kits and recording of AEs only (in Portugal and \nSweden, hematology and liver function test evaluations will be \nperformed at all IMP dispensing visits until end of treatment) . After \n264 weeks in LTS11210, some assessments will no longer be \nrequired in either scheduled visits or EOT visit (see Section 1.2).  \nAdditional laboratory testing (central) including hematology and liver \nfunction tests will be performed at week 2, week 6, and week 10 (site \nor home visits). \nEfficacy assessments will be performed at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and \nthen every 12 weeks up to Week 96 and then every 24 weeks until \nthe end of treatment. \nHealth economic assessments and Patient Reported outcomes \n(PROs) defined per initial study will be performed every 12 weeks up \nto Week 96 and then every 24 weeks until Week 264.  PROs will not \nbe assessed after Week 264, including EOT if EOT is after Week \n264. \nPatients who completed EFC11072 Part B will have an additional \nX-ray evaluation at week 48, 96, 144, 192 (\u00b114 days for each \nevaluation) or at EOT if EOT prior to Week 192.  \nElectrocardiograms (ECGs) will be performed at the initial visit, week \n48, 96, 144, 192, 240 and 264 or EOT. ECGs will not be performed \nafter Week 264, including EOT if EOT is after Week 264. \nAdverse events will be collected throughout the study. \nPharmacokinetic samples will be collected at V1 or V1/V2, V4 \n(Week 4), V7 (Week 12),  every 12 weeks thereafter through year 2 \nand then every 24 weeks until the end of treatment and at the \nPost-Treatment follow-up visit 6 weeks after the end of treatment. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 6 \n \nSpecific serum samples will be taken during the study to test for anti-\ndrug antibody to sarilumab at week 12, every 12 weeks thereafter \nthrough year 2 and then every 24 weeks until the end of treatment \nand at the Post-Treatment follow-up visit 6 weeks after the end of \ntreatment. \nSerum samples to store for future biomarker analyses will be \ncollected at the initial visit, week 2, 12, and 48 (except for EFC13752 \npatients). Whole blood to store for future ribonucleic acid (RNA) \nexpression analysis will be collected at week 0 (baseline) and week \n2, except for patients from study SFY13370 and EFC13752. \nThere will be a 6-week post treatment observation period for patients \nwith early discontinuation and for patients who completed the \nplanned treatment period. In patients who complete sarilumab \ntreatment per protocol in countries where sarilumab is commercially \navailable the post treatment follow-up visit may be cancelled if the \npatient initiates treatment with commercial sarilumab during the post \ntreatment follow-up period. However, in this case, a telephone \ncontact must be established with the patient to capture all AEs \noccurring up to the 1st administration of commercial sarilumab. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \nPatient Population: \nThe primary analysis population will be safety population which is \ndefined as all patients who have received at least one dose of \ntreatment.   \nAnalysis Methods: \nThe safety analyses will be based on the reported adverse events, \nclinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs. The \nnumber and proportion of patients who experience an adverse event \nwill be summarized by treatment group.  Other categorical variables \nwill be described in the same way.  Continuous variables will be \ndescribed using the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum \nand maximum.  All summaries will be based on observed cases only; \nmissing response data will not be imputed. \nFor efficacy variables, descriptive statistics will be provided and 95% \nconfidence intervals will be calculated if appropriate. \nDescriptive statistics will be provided for the van der Heijde modified \ntotal Sharp score for the subset of patients who previously \ncompleted study EFC11072, Part B. \nData analysis results for patients who roll over from the EFC13752 \nstudy will be presented separately as sarilumab is administered as \nmonotherapy in the EFC13752 and these patients will continue to be \non sarilumab monotherapy in the LTS11210 study. \nDURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per \npatient)  \nDuration of the study treatment will be at least 264 weeks from the \nfirst study drug administration in LTS11210, or until sarilumab is \ncommercially available in the patient\u2019s country whichever later, but \nno later than 2020 when the study will be closed. (In the UK the \nduration of treatment will be 264 weeks from the first study drug \nadministration in LTS11210).  \nThe maximum duration of the study is expected to be approximately \n523 weeks: \nUp to 1-week of screening, if any \n \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 7 \n \nUp to 516-week open label treatment phase (for the earliest patients \nenrolled in LTS11210 in 2010 if sarilumab is not commercialized by \n2020) \n6-week post-treatment follow-up as required by the protocol \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  31-Aug-2015 SAR153191-LTS11210  Version number:  1 Property of sanofi - strictly confidential Page 8 ",

If the patient enters the sub-study, then the sub-study IMP will be dispensed instead of the main study IMP at \nthe entry into sub-study and IMP compliance with sub-study IMP will be reviewed at the end of sub-study. Full details of the sub-study are provided in Appendix R  \nc HV: Visit can be home visit or clinic visit to draw and collect the blood sample only for hematology and LFTs using the designated central laboratory.  \nd Last treatment visit from the study EFC11072, EFC10832, SFY13370, or EFC13752.   \ne Physical examination to be done at Week 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, 264, 288, 336, 384, 432, 480 and EOT visit \nf \nThe assessment is NOT required when EOT visit is after Week 264. \ng X-ray of hands and feet (only for patients who completed Part B of the study EFC11072 will be done at Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192 (\u00b114 days for each assessment), and EOT; No X-ray evaluation will be performed \nafter Week 192 including EOT if EOT is after Week 192. Required x-ray must be done after confirmation of negative urine pregnancy test in women of child bearing potential. \nh After Week 264, only DAS28 components of ACR core set will be assessed (TJC & SJC for 28 joints, patient\u00b4s global assessment of disease activity). \ni \nHematology:  Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) morphology (if blood cell count is abnormal), white blood cell (WBC) with differential, platelets count. For all patients, a CBC test must be performed \nbefore or at Visit 3 (using either designated central or a local laboratory facility) but not earlier than the 12th day after the first dose of IMP administration in order to confirm that the neutrophil count and platelet \ncount are not within the protocol-defined limits for temporary or permanent discontinuation of study drug. \nj \nLiver Function Tests (LFTs): Prothrombin Time (PT), Albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated \nbilirubin. PT is NOT required at any visit after Week 264. \nk Lipids (fasting): Total cholesterol (TC), High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, Apolipoprotein A, and Apolipoprotein B. After Week 264, lipids \n(excluding Apolipoprotein A, and Apolipoprotein B ) will only be assessed at Weeks 288, 336, 384, 432, 480 (including EOT if EOT is after Week 264) \nl \nClinical chemistry (fasting): fasting glucose, total proteins, calcium, sodium, potassium, Lactate Dehydrogenase, (LDH), urea nitrogen and creatinine.

If any parameter is abnormal, a urinalysis sample should be sent to central laboratory for \ntesting. If positive for proteins, microscopic analysis will be performed by central laboratory.  \np After Visit 7 (Week 12) between study visits the patient will have a urine pregnancy test at home on a monthly basis.  Patients will be given sufficient urine pregnancy kits to take home at each successive visit \nfor monthly testing up until the final treatment visit. When the testing coincides with a clinical visit as indicated in the flow chart, the results should be reported in the e-CRF. No pregnancy test kits will be \ndispensed at EOT. \nq ECG to be done at Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, 264 or EOT; No ECG will be done after Week 264 including EOT if EOT is after Week 264  \nr \nRheumatoid factor only at Weeks 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, 264 or EOT; No Rheumatoid factor will be assessed after Week 264 including EOT if EOT is after Week 264 \ns If throughout the study a serious adverse event (SAE) occurs in a patient, blood samples should be collected for sarilumab at or near the onset and completion of the occurrence of the event, if possible.

        "Content": " Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, debilitating disease that primarily affects the synovial membrane of diarthrodial joints. Currently, treatment of RA involves the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide are DMARDs that have been used by rheumatologists for many years (1)(2)(3). Introduction of biologic agents, especially inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1, has greatly improved the therapeutic options available for treating RA (4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9); however, no therapeutic modality provides either universal or complete control of disease and safety remains one of the key issues with anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment (10)(11). Besides early benefit/risk of biologics, the long term outcome of RA remain a critical question: long term use of biologics have been associated with immunosuppression and effects on the development of infections, malignancies, demyelinating events, lupus like events, etc.  Consequently, long-term data are needed to investigate the risks associated with the long-term use of these drugs. This LTS11210 study is intended to identify potential late onset adverse events associated with long-term use of sarilumab with or without concomitant non-biologic DMARD(s), including MTX, as well as to assess long-term efficacy.

                "Content": " Sarilumab is a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-6R\u03b1 receptor produced using VelocImmune\u00ae technology developed by Regeneron. Sarilumab blocks the IL6 receptor and inhibits IL-6 signaling. Sarilumab is under development for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe RA. Sarilumab is a covalent heterotetramer consisting of two, disulfide linked human heavy chains, each covalently linked through disulfide bonds to a fully human kappa light chain. The antibody possesses a protein molecular weight of approximately 155 kDa, with a single N-linked glycosylation site in each heavy chain, located within the constant region in the Fc portion of the molecule.  The sarilumab heavy chain has an IgG1 isotype constant region (an allotype). The variable domains of the heavy and light chains combine to form the IL-6R\u03b1 binding site within the antibody. ",

Prior to entering LTS11210 patients were included in ACT11575, EFC11072, EFC10832, SFY13370, or EFC13752.   In the initial studies patients were exposed to IMP for: \u2022 12 weeks if they were initially randomized in EFC11072 Part A or ACT11575;  \u2022 between 2 and 52 weeks, if initially randomized in EFC11072 Part B;  \u2022 between 12 and 24 weeks, if initially randomized in EFC10832;  \u2022 24 weeks, if initially randomized in SFY13370 or EFC13752. These studies are described briefly below: EFC11072:  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, two-part, dose ranging (Part A) and confirmatory (Part B) study with an operationally seamless design, evaluating efficacy and safety of sarilumab added to methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who are inadequate responders to MTX therapy. The study is completed.  In the dose ranging part of the study (Part A), five doses (100 mg weekly [qw], 150 mg qw, 100 mg every other week [q2w], 150 mg q2w, and 200 mg q2w) and placebo were tested in combination with methotrexate (MTX).  Two doses (150 mg every two weeks [q2w] and 200 mg q2w) were selected for the pivotal phase 3 studies. In the Phase 3 confirmatory part (Part B) both sarillumab arms showed clinically relevant and statistically significant (p<0.0001) improvements compared with placebo in all 3 co-primary efficacy endpoints (signs and symptoms [American College of Rheumatology criteria, ACR20], physical function [Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, HAQ-DI], and radiographic progression [modified van der Heijde total Sharp score, vdH-mTSS]).  In this study, the safety profile was consistent with previous studies showing higher incidence of infections including serious infections, in the sarilumab treated groups compared to placebo, along with the expected laboratory data: a decrease in neutrophil count, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated serum LDL-cholesterol and injection site reactions (i.e., erythema, pruritus and rash). The incidence of treatment emergent anti-drug antibody (ADA) in the sarilumab 150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w, and placebo groups were 19.8%, 14.6%, and 4.2%, with 3.5%, 2.4% and 0.2% of neutralizing ADA, respectively.  No notable differences have been observed with regards to loss or lack of efficacy or hypersensitivity reactions, including systemic and local, between those patients who were ADA positive and ADA negative (see the Investigator\u2019s Brochure for details). ACT11575:  A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active calibrator-controlled study assessing the clinical benefit of sarilumab on top of MTX in patients with active RA who have failed previous TNF-\u03b1 antagonists was terminated by the Sponsor due to administrative reasons with only 16 patients enrolled.

Patients, who were randomized in Part B of the study EFC11072 in a treatment arm subsequently not retained following pivotal dose selection, were also eligible for enrollment.  Initially in LTS11210, patients received 150 mg of sarilumab SC weekly as the highest dose studied in EFC11072 Part A. The reduced dose (due to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or an increase in liver enzymes (ALT)), was 150 mg q2w.  Once the dose regimens were selected for the Phase 3 studies (150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w), patients already ongoing in the study at the highest dose were switched to the new highest sarilumab dose 200 mg q2w, as soon as permitted by administrative process.

The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire rated 0 to 4 \noriginally developed to measure fatigue in patients with cancer and widely used in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients that demonstrates good consistency and sensitivity to change. \nThe patient will be asked to answer 13 questions rated 0 to 4 (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, \n2 = some what, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much) (see Appendix F). The patient will be asked \nto fill in the questionnaire at different site visits (see flow chart, Section 1.2) \n\u2022 The Work Productivity and Activities Impairment (WPAI) will be assessed for patients \ncoming from EFC11072 and ACT11575 only.  The WPAI was developed by Margaret \nReilly for assessing productivity losses by measuring the effect of general health and \nsymptom severity on work as well as usual activity productivity.  Specific-disease WPAI \nexists and can be adapted to different pathologies.  The RA WPAI (Appendix G): \ninstrument consists of 6 questions that ask the subject the number of hours missed from \nwork (ie, absenteeism) due to RA, the number of hours missed from work for anything \nother than RA, the number of hours totally worked, as well as how much the RA does \naffect the productivity at work or the ability to do daily activities over the past 7 days. The \ninstrument can be self-, interview-, or telephone-administered and takes less than 5 \nminutes to complete (~3 minutes). The 4 scores of the questionnaire are expressed as \nimpairment percentages with higher numbers reflecting greater impairment and decreased \nproductivity. The 4 scores are: \n1. Percent work time missed due to RA \n2. Percent impairment while working due to RA \n3. Percent overall work impairment due to RA \n4. Percent activity impairment due to RA \n\u2022 The WPAI has been tested in many disease states including migraine, arthritis, \nhypertension, diabetes, and depression and is adaptable to specific health problems such as \nRA. Inclusion of this measure in the study assesses the impact of sarilumab on a major \ncomponent of subjects\u2019 lives, which is their ability to perform daily activities and/or be \nable to work. The patient will be asked to fill in the questionnaire at different site visits \n(see flow chart, Section 1.2) \n\u2022 Assessment of joint replacement and joint procedures if any will be performed: total joint \nreplacement (arthroplasty). \n\u2022 Sleep: Rheumatoid arthritis, like other chronic illness, is associated with sleep \ndisturbances. Sleep disturbance is linked to pain, mood, and disease activity. The effect of \nsarilumab on pain will be assessed on a VAS scale (see Appendix H). The patient will be \nasked to fill in the questionnaire at different site visits (see flow chart, Section 1.2) \n\u2022 SF-36: The Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is a generic questionnaire measuring general health \nstatus (quality of life). It is one of the most frequently used and has been extensively \nvalidated in rheumatologic disease (see Appendix I ).

In the present protocol, in order to closely follow LFTs, assessment of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time, albumin, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin will be performed per specifications on the study flow chart (see Section 1.2). \u2022 The study drug should be permanently discontinued in case of confirmed ALT > 5 ULN or in case of confirmed ALT>3 ULN and concomitant total bilirubin >2 ULN (unless the patient has a documented Gilbert\u2019s disease).  A complete serological and ultrasonography work-up should be conducted in case of ALT >5 ULN or ALT>3 ULN and concomitant bilirubin >2 ULN (see Appendix L). \u2022 If ALT \u22653 ULN and \u22645 ULN and bilirubin \u22642 ULN, administration of study drug must be temporarily interrupted, and the study Investigator should immediately contact the patient to arrange for repeat LFTs within 48 hours from the Investigator\u2019s awareness of the abnormal LFT results: - IMP should be temporarily interrupted until the ALT is below <3 ULN then restarted at the dose of 150 mg q2w at the Investigator\u00b4s discretion. - LFTs should be repeated according to the provided guideline and at a minimum of every 7 days until conditions for resumption of IMP administration are met (see Appendix L).

In addition the patients will continue to \nbe treated beyond 264 weeks until sarilumab is commercially \navailable in their country or until 2020 at the latest when the study \nwill be closed. (In the UK the duration of treatment will be 264 weeks \nfrom the first study drug administration in LTS11210). At the time of \ninclusion in this long-term extension, patients may have been \nexposed to sarilumab or placebo or active comparator for 2 to 52 \nweeks, depending on the study in which they were initially included. \nThe sarilumab dose is reduced to 150 mg q2w in case of \nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or an increase in liver enzymes \n(alanine aminotransferase (ALT).  \nA 12-week optional sub-study to evaluate the usability of pre-filled \nsyringe with safety system (PFS-S) will be conducted in some \ncountries. Patients in selected sites in those countries may be \noffered the opportunity to participate in this PFS-S sub-study.  \nSTUDY POPULATION  \nMain selection criteria: \nInclusion criteria \nPatients with RA who were randomized:  \n\u2022 in the study EFC11072 (a randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled study in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who \nare inadequate responders to MTX therapy) \n- \nand who have completed Part A (12 weeks) or Part B \n(52 weeks) of the study EFC11072. \n- \nor patients randomized in Part B of EFC11072 to a \ntreatment arm subsequently not retained following \npivotal dose selection. \n\u2022 in the study ACT11575 and completed the treatment period. \n\u2022 in the study EFC10832 \n- \nand completed the 24-week study treatment period. \n- \nor patients from 12 weeks onward with per protocol-\ndefined  lack of efficacy \n\u2022 in the study SFY13370 and completed the treatment period \n\u2022 in the study EFC13752 and completed the treatment period  \nExclusion criteria \n\u2212 \nPatients with any adverse event leading to permanent \nstudy drug (active or placebo) discontinuation in a prior \nstudy \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 4 \n \n\u2212 \nPatients with an abnormality(ies) or adverse event(s) that \nper investigator judgment would adversely affect \nparticipation of the patient in the study \nTotal expected number of patients: \nMaximum number of patients = Approximately 2000 patients. \nExpected number of sites: \nApproximately 400 sites \nSTUDY TREATMENT(s) \n \nInvestigational Medicinal Product(s) \n \nFormulation \nSarilumab (anti-Interleukin 6R\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (Anti-IL6R\u03b1 \nmAb)   \nTwo different pharmaceutical forms are used in the study: C1F2 \nused in vials and C2F3 (pivotal formulation) used in prefilled \nsyringes. \nBefore Phase 3 pivotal dose selection decision:  vials 150 mg \n(75 mg/ml)  \nAfter Phase 3 pivotal dose selection decision, and prior to \navailability of prefilled syringes: vials 150 mg (75 mg/mL), and \n200 mg (100 mg/mL)  \nAfter Phase 3 pivotal dose selection decision, upon availability \nof prefilled syringes:   prefilled syringes filled with 150 mg \n(131.6 mg/ml) or 200 mg (175 mg/ml) of drug product \nIn the sub-study: prefilled syringes with a needle safety shield \n(PFS-S) with exactly the same IMP formulation as the PFS used in \nthe main study  \nRoute(s) of administration: \nSubcutaneous (SC) injection in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm \nInjection volume: 2 mL (vials);

At D1, after \nconfirmation of eligibility, patients will be enrolled in the LTS11210 \nstudy.  \nPatients will have site visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12, then every \n12 weeks until the 2nd year of treatment in the study (Week 96). \nAfter 2 years of study participation, safety assessment and \nlaboratory tests will take place at 24-week intervals. In addition, there \nwill be visits at 24-week intervals in between regular study visits for \ndistribution of IMP kits and recording of AEs only (in Portugal and \nSweden, hematology and liver function test evaluations will be \nperformed at all IMP dispensing visits until end of treatment) . After \n264 weeks in LTS11210, some assessments will no longer be \nrequired in either scheduled visits or EOT visit (see Section 1.2).  \nAdditional laboratory testing (central) including hematology and liver \nfunction tests will be performed at week 2, week 6, and week 10 (site \nor home visits). \nEfficacy assessments will be performed at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and \nthen every 12 weeks up to Week 96 and then every 24 weeks until \nthe end of treatment. \nHealth economic assessments and Patient Reported outcomes \n(PROs) defined per initial study will be performed every 12 weeks up \nto Week 96 and then every 24 weeks until Week 264.

Whole blood to store for future ribonucleic acid (RNA) \nexpression analysis will be collected at week 0 (baseline) and week \n2, except for patients from study SFY13370 and EFC13752. \nThere will be a 6-week post treatment observation period for patients \nwith early discontinuation and for patients who completed the \nplanned treatment period. In patients who complete sarilumab \ntreatment per protocol in countries where sarilumab is commercially \navailable the post treatment follow-up visit may be cancelled if the \npatient initiates treatment with commercial sarilumab during the post \ntreatment follow-up period. However, in this case, a telephone \ncontact must be established with the patient to capture all AEs \noccurring up to the 1st administration of commercial sarilumab. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS \n \nPatient Population: \nThe primary analysis population will be safety population which is \ndefined as all patients who have received at least one dose of \ntreatment.   \nAnalysis Methods: \nThe safety analyses will be based on the reported adverse events, \nclinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs. The \nnumber and proportion of patients who experience an adverse event \nwill be summarized by treatment group.  Other categorical variables \nwill be described in the same way.  Continuous variables will be \ndescribed using the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum \nand maximum.  All summaries will be based on observed cases only; \nmissing response data will not be imputed. \nFor efficacy variables, descriptive statistics will be provided and 95% \nconfidence intervals will be calculated if appropriate. \nDescriptive statistics will be provided for the van der Heijde modified \ntotal Sharp score for the subset of patients who previously \ncompleted study EFC11072, Part B. \nData analysis results for patients who roll over from the EFC13752 \nstudy will be presented separately as sarilumab is administered as \nmonotherapy in the EFC13752 and these patients will continue to be \non sarilumab monotherapy in the LTS11210 study. \nDURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per \npatient)  \nDuration of the study treatment will be at least 264 weeks from the \nfirst study drug administration in LTS11210, or until sarilumab is \ncommercially available in the patient\u2019s country whichever later, but \nno later than 2020 when the study will be closed.

\nCurrently, treatment of RA involves the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nglucocorticoids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Methotrexate, \nsulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide are DMARDs that have been used by \nrheumatologists for many years (1)(2)(3). \nIntroduction of biologic agents, especially inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1, has greatly improved the \ntherapeutic options available for treating RA (4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9); however, no therapeutic modality \nprovides either universal or complete control of disease and safety remains one of the key issues \nwith anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment (10)(11). \nBesides early benefit/risk of biologics, the long term outcome of RA remain a critical question: \nlong term use of biologics have been associated with immunosuppression and effects on the \ndevelopment of infections, malignancies, demyelinating events, lupus like events, etc.  \nConsequently, long-term data are needed to investigate the risks associated with the long-term use \nof these drugs. \nThis LTS11210 study is intended to identify potential late onset adverse events associated with \nlong-term use of sarilumab with or without concomitant non-biologic DMARD(s), including \nMTX, as well as to assess long-term efficacy. \n4.1 \nSARILUMAB \nSarilumab is a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-\n6R\u03b1 receptor produced using VelocImmune\u00ae technology developed by Regeneron. Sarilumab \nblocks the IL6 receptor and inhibits IL-6 signaling. Sarilumab is under development for the \ntreatment of patients with moderate to severe RA. \nSarilumab is a covalent heterotetramer consisting of two, disulfide linked human heavy chains, \neach covalently linked through disulfide bonds to a fully human kappa light chain. The antibody \npossesses a protein molecular weight of approximately 155 kDa, with a single N-linked \nglycosylation site in each heavy chain, located within the constant region in the Fc portion of the \nmolecule.  The sarilumab heavy chain has an IgG1 isotype constant region (an allotype). The \nvariable domains of the heavy and light chains combine to form the IL-6R\u03b1 binding site within \nthe antibody. \n4.1.1 Summary of nonclinical studies \nSee the clinical investigator\u2019s brochure (CIB) for detailed information.  \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 33 \n4.1.2 Summary of previous human experience \nSee the Clinical Investigator\u2019s Brochure for detailed information. \nPrior to entering LTS11210 patients were included in ACT11575, EFC11072, EFC10832, \nSFY13370, or EFC13752.   \nIn the initial studies patients were exposed to IMP for: \n\u2022 12 weeks if they were initially randomized in EFC11072 Part A or ACT11575;  \n\u2022 between 2 and 52 weeks, if initially randomized in EFC11072 Part B;  \n\u2022 between 12 and 24 weeks, if initially randomized in EFC10832;  \n\u2022 24 weeks, if initially randomized in SFY13370 or EFC13752. \nThese studies are described briefly below: \nEFC11072:  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, two-part, dose \nranging (Part A) and confirmatory (Part B) study with an operationally seamless design, \nevaluating efficacy and safety of sarilumab added to methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active \nrheumatoid arthritis who are inadequate responders to MTX therapy. The study is completed.  \nIn the dose ranging part of the study (Part A), five doses (100 mg weekly [qw], 150 mg qw, \n100 mg every other week [q2w], 150 mg q2w, and 200 mg q2w) and placebo were tested in \ncombination with methotrexate (MTX).  Two doses (150 mg every two weeks [q2w] and 200 mg \nq2w) were selected for the pivotal phase 3 studies. In the Phase 3 confirmatory part (Part B) both \nsarillumab arms showed clinically relevant and statistically significant (p<0.0001) improvements \ncompared with placebo in all 3 co-primary efficacy endpoints (signs and symptoms [American \nCollege of Rheumatology criteria, ACR20], physical function [Health Assessment Questionnaire \nDisability Index, HAQ-DI], and radiographic progression [modified van der Heijde total Sharp \nscore, vdH-mTSS]).  In this study, the safety profile was consistent with previous studies showing \nhigher incidence of infections including serious infections, in the sarilumab treated groups \ncompared to placebo, along with the expected laboratory data: a decrease in neutrophil count, \nelevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated serum LDL-cholesterol and injection site reactions \n(i.e., erythema, pruritus and rash). The incidence of treatment emergent anti-drug antibody (ADA) \nin the sarilumab 150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w, and placebo groups were 19.8%, 14.6%, and 4.2%, \nwith 3.5%, 2.4% and 0.2% of neutralizing ADA, respectively.  No notable differences have been \nobserved with regards to loss or lack of efficacy or hypersensitivity reactions, including systemic \nand local, between those patients who were ADA positive and ADA negative (see the Investigator\u2019s \nBrochure for details). \nACT11575:  A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active calibrator-\ncontrolled study assessing the clinical benefit of sarilumab on top of MTX in patients with active \nRA who have failed previous TNF-\u03b1 antagonists was terminated by the Sponsor due to \nadministrative reasons with only 16 patients enrolled.   \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 34 \nThe objective of ACT11575 was to demonstrate that sarilumab added to MTX is superior in \nefficacy to placebo, for the relief of signs and symptoms of RA, in patients with active RA who \nhave failed up to 2 TNF-\u03b1 antagonists.  \nEFC10832: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study assessing the \nefficacy and safety of sarilumab added to DMARD therapy in patients with active rheumatoid \narthritis (RA) who are inadequate responders or intolerant to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) \nantagonists. The study is completed. \nThe objective of EFC10832 was to demonstrate that sarilumab added to DMARD therapy is \nsuperior in efficacy to placebo for the relief of signs and symptoms of RA at Week 24 in patients \nwith active RA who are inadequate responders or intolerant to TNF-\u03b1 antagonists. \nSFY13370:  A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study assessing the safety and \ntolerability of sarilumab and tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are inadequate \nresponders to or intolerant of TNF antagonists. The study is completed. \nThe primary objective of SFY13370 was to assess, in the same study, the safety of sarilumab and \ntocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are inadequate responders to or \nintolerant of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. \nEFC13752: An open-label, randomized, parallel group study assessing the immunogenicity and \nsafety of sarilumab administered as monotherapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.

The reduced dose (due to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or an \nincrease in liver enzymes (ALT)), was 150 mg q2w.  Once the dose regimens were selected for \nthe Phase 3 studies (150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w), patients already ongoing in the study at the \nhighest dose were switched to the new highest sarilumab dose 200 mg q2w, as soon as permitted \nby administrative process.  Patients previously assigned to the reduced dose of 150 mg q2w \nbecause of a safety issue continued to receive 150 mg q2w. \n6.2 \nDURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION \nThe IMP will be administered for 264 weeks from the first IMP administration in LTS11210. In \naddition the patients will continue to be treated beyond 264 weeks until sarilumab is commercially \navailable in their country or until 2020 at the latest when the study will be closed. (In the UK the \nduration of treatment will be 264 weeks from the first study drug administration in LTS11210). \nThe total maximum duration of study participation for a patient may be up to 523 weeks.  \n\u2022 1-week screening period if applicable  \n\u2022 516-week maximum treatment period in LTS11210 (for the earliest patients enrolled in \nLTS11210 in 2010 if sarilumab is not commercialized by 2020)  \n\u2022 6-week follow up period as required per protocol \nFurther explanation is given below and in Section 12.1. \nPatients will either enter a 1-week screening period (patients from EFC11072 Part A or Part B1 \nand ACT11575), or enrol directly into the treatment period (for patients from EFC11072 Part B2, \nEFC10832, SFY13370, or EFC13752 the EOT visit in the initial study corresponds to the \nrandomization visit in the LTS11210 study).  \nThe duration of the treatment period in the study will be at least 264 weeks, or up to a maximum \nof 516 weeks (except in the UK where the duration of treatment will be 264 weeks).  \nPatients will return for the safety follow-up visit 6 weeks after the EOT visit. In case of early \ntreatment discontinuation, patients are required to complete the EOT visit and to return for the \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 37 \n6-week safety follow-up visit as well. In patients who complete sarilumab treatment per protocol \nin countries where sarilumab is commercially available the post treatment follow-up visit may be \ncancelled if the patient initiates treatment with commercial sarilumab during the post treatment \nfollow-up period. However, in this case, a telephone contact must be established with the patient \nto capture all AEs occurring up to the 1st administration of commercial sarilumab. \nThe study will be considered completed for a patient at the time he/she completes all the \nscheduled procedures as described in Section 12.1. \n6.3 \nOPTIONAL PFS-S SUB-STUDY \nAn optional 12-week sub-study aiming to evaluate the usability of pre-filled syringe with safety \nsystem (PFS-S) will be conducted in some countries. Patients enrolled in LTS11210 at selected \nsites in those countries may participate in the PFS-S sub-study from Week 24 of the main study \nafter providing written informed consent for the sub-study. However, patients may continue to \nparticipate in the main trial without participating in the PFS-S sub-study if they wish. Full details \nof the PFS-S sub-study are presented in Appendix R. \n6.4 \nSTUDY COMMITTEES \n6.4.1 Data Monitoring Committee \nA Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is in place for the sarilumab clinical study program. The \nsarilumab DMC monitors the safety of the patients participating in all ongoing sarilumab studies.  \nThe DMC is responsible for giving appropriate recommendations to the Sponsor on safety aspects \nduring the conduct of the study, if needed.  In addition to the review of serious adverse events \nwith fatal outcome and specific adverse events, the DMC has access to complementary safety \nparameters (eg, vital signs, laboratory test results etc.) and access to limited efficacy data.  The \nDMC responsibilities and the data review processes are fully described in the sarilumab DMC \ncharter. \nMembers of the DMC will be independent of those performing the study, being neither \ninvestigators nor employees of the Sponsor; and without conflict of interest regarding study \noutcome (whatever they are). \n6.4.2 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee \nAn independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) has been established for the \nsarilumab clinical study program.  The role of the CAC is to apply uniform criteria for the \nevaluation of cardiovascular events (including retrospective events), and to adjudicate these \nevents in a consistent and unbiased manner throughout the course of the study.  The goal of the \nCAC is to ensure that cardiovascular events reported by the site are judged uniformly, using the \nsame criteria by a group of experts in cardiology and neurology, independent from Sanofi. The \nCAC will be blinded to treatment allocation.

Sarilumab, in vials (formulation C1F2), was \ndispensed to all patients enrolled into the study prior to the phase 3 dose selection \ndecision. Thereafter, drug product in vials has been phased out of the study, and patients \nhave been dispensed with drug product in prefilled syringes (pivotal formulation C2F3) \nonce sufficient quantities were available and appropriate local approvals obtained. For \ncompleteness, all IMP formats used during the study are presented here: \n- \nCurrently dispensed IMP for all patients:  \n- \nSarilumab in prefilled syringe (PFS): Glass syringes with a 27 gauge thin wall, \n1/2-inch staked needle, with FM30 needle tip cap (latex free) filled at 1.14 mL with \nC2F3 drug product at 131.6 mg/mL (150mg dose) or 175 mg/mL (200mg dose). \nPFS with FM30 needle tip is the only pharmaceutical form dispensed to patients \nfrom EFC10832, SFY13370, and EFC13752. \n- \nSarilumab in prefilled syringe with safety system (PFS-S) with exactly the \nsame formulation as the PFS with FM30 needle tip cap described above. The \nPFS-S is used for patients in the sub-study only.

It is preferred that subcutaneous \ninjection sites be rotated between the four quadrants of the abdomen (except the navel or \nwaist area) or the thigh (front and side).  If needed, SC injection can be administered by a \ncaregiver in the upper arm (lateral side). \nSubjects and/or their non-professional caregivers will be trained to prepare and administer \nstudy drug at the start of the double blind-treatment period of the previous study.  This \ntraining must be documented in the subject\u2019s study file.  The study staff should review the \nsubject\u2019s self-administration technique at Visit 2 or V1/V2 (Week 0) for the LTS11210 \nstudy.  For doses not given at the study site, diaries will be provided to record information \npertaining to those injections.  If the subject is unable or unwilling to administer study \ndrug, arrangements must be made for a qualified site personnel or a caregiver to \nadminister study drug doses that are not scheduled to be given at the study site. \nThe IMP administration should be taken strictly every 14 days as per protocol IMP \nadministration schedule, however an IMP administration time window of \u00b13 days is \npermitted in exceptional circumstances (eg, the result of a repeat CBC test is not available, \nor an ongoing adverse event). For the subsequent IMP administration the initial IMP \nadministration schedule should be followed again.  \nNote: an interval of at least 11 days between 2 IMP doses must be maintained. \n8.2 \nNON INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS \nFor patients rolling over from EFC11072, ACT11575, EFC10832, and SFY13370: \nAll patients should continue to receive the non-biologic DMARD(s) background therapy that they \nwere receiving in the initial study until the end of study treatment. However, at any time the \nDMARD(s) dose can be reduced, temporarily or permanently discontinued, or a patient may \nswitch to alternate approved non-biologic DMARD for safety or tolerability reasons. If the new \nDMARD is initiated the dosing as well as safety monitoring should follow the applicable local \nlabeling information. \nEach non-biologic DMARD will be recorded throughout the study on the e-CRF.  Any change \nshould be recorded on the e-CRF.  DMARD(s) will not be dispensed or supplied by the Sponsor \nas an investigational product. \nAll patients receiving MTX as their background DMARD will also receive folic/folinic acid \n(5 mg weekly or greater) according to local guidelines in the country where the study is \nconducted. \nFor patients rolling over from EFC13752: \nTreatment with non-biologic DMARDs is not allowed.

If the new DMARD is initiated the dosing as well \nas safety monitoring should follow local labeling information. For EFC13752 patients, the \ntreatment with non-biologic DMARD(s) is not authorized until the end of the treatment. \nSee Section 8.2 for additional details. \n\u2022 Treatment with tofacitinib or any other JAK inhibitor is not authorized during the course \nof the study. If any of these treatments are used, the patient should be discontinued. \n\u2022 Administration of any live (attenuated) vaccine is contraindicated (see list in Appendix K) \nuntil 3 months following the last study drug administration. \n\u2022 Treatment with any investigational medicinal product other than sarilumab is not \npermitted. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 45 \n8.8.2 Permitted concomitant medication \n\u2022 Steroids \n- \nOral corticosteroids are permitted to be taken at the time of study entry at the dose of \n\u2264 10 mg prednisone or equivalent. \n- \nIntranasal or inhaled corticosteroids are authorized as needed throughout the study. \n- \nAt any time the corticosteroid dose can be modified, temporarily or permanently \ndiscontinued, or a new steroid initiated (irrespective of the mode of administration), for \nany reason per investigator judgment including but not limited to worsening of RA, \ntreatment of AEs or for the prevention of corticosteroid associated side effects.  \n\u2022 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics: \n- \nNon-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-\n2) are permitted as needed throughout the study. The dose used should be in \naccordance with the approved dose in the country in which the study is conducted.  \n- \nNarcotic or non-narcotic analgesics (with no anti-inflammatory properties) for RA pain \nrelief are permitted based on investigator judgment that there is insufficient RA pain \nrelief with stable maintenance NSAIDs. As limited treatment for inter-current pain, all \nanalgesics (with no anti-inflammatory properties) are allowed. These analgesics, \nincluding acetaminophen, should be avoided within 6 hours of efficacy assessments, \nincluding physical function and quality of life assessments. \n- \nAcetaminophen use should be limited to 4g/24h. Specific attention should be paid to \nco-administration of hepatotoxic drugs (see specific Section 10.2.4).   \n\u2022 Cytochrome P450 enzyme substrates \nIL6 has been shown to reduce CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzyme \nexpression in in-vitro studies. Therefore, when IL-6 is blocked using sarilumab IL-6 levels \n\u201cnormalize\u201d and CYP450 enzymes may increase which could result in dose adjustment for \ndrugs that are metabolized by CYP450 enzymes. As a precautionary measure, drugs which \nare metabolized via these cytochromes and with a narrow therapeutic index should be \nadjusted if needed: dose to be increased to maintain efficacy after initiation of sarilumab \nand to be decreased after sarilumab is stopped. Some examples of CYP450 substrates with \na narrow therapeutic index, requiring monitoring of effect are warfarin or monitoring of \ndrug concentration include cyclosporine, theophylline, digoxin, antiepileptics, such as \ncarbamazepine (Carbatrol\u00ae, Tegretol\u00ae), divalproex (Depakote\u00ae), phenytoin (Dilantin\u00ae), \nor valproic acid (Depakene\u00ae); or antiarrhythmics, such as disopyramide (Norpace\u00ae), \nprocainamide (Procan\u00ae, Pronestyl\u00ae), or quinidine (Quinidex\u00ae, Quin-Release Quin-G\u00ae). \n\u2022 Lipid lowering drugs: \nLipid lowering drugs are permitted. Anti-IL-6 drugs, including sarilumab are known to \nincrease serum cholesterol levels and this effect will be closely monitored during the \nstudy.

Treatments received during the study should be recorded on the \ncorresponding pages of the patient\u2019s e-CRF as appropriate. \nJoint replacement is permitted during the study. The IMP should be temporarily interrupted prior \nto surgery as per applicable guidelines and the IMP restarted as soon as proper wound healing is \nestablished.  \nNOTE: The IMP can be temporarily discontinued for \u226459 days (3 IMP doses can be missed). If \nthe re-initiation of the IMP occurs later than 38 days since the last IMP dose (2 IMP doses were \nalready missed), the IMP has to be administered at the study site and the patient to be observed for \n30 minutes for any medical events. \n8.10 \nTREATMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMPLIANCE \nMeasures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance and investigational medicinal \nproduct accountability include: \n\u2022 Proper recording of medication treatment pack number on appropriate e-CRF page for \naccounting purposes. \n\u2022 All medication treatment kits (containing vials, or prefilled syringes, whether empty or \nunused study medication) are returned by the patient at each visit.  \n- \nAs the used prefilled syringes cannot be safely returned to the study site after \nadministration of IMP, the completed patient injection diary (returned to the site at \neach visit), returned treatment kit boxes and any unused prefilled syringes will be used \nfor drug accountability purposes. \n\u2022 The study coordinator tracks treatment accountability/compliance, either by diary, or by \ncounting the number of empty IMP containers (vials or prefilled syringes), and fills in the \nappropriate page of the patient treatment log. \n\u2022 The monitor in charge of the study then checks the data entered on the investigational \nmedicinal product administration page by comparing them with the investigational \nmedicinal product which has been retrieved and the patient treatment log form. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 47 \n8.11 \nRETURN AND/OR DESTRUCTION OF TREATMENTS \nAll partially used or unused treatments will be retrieved by the investigator.

In \nthis protocol, unless otherwise specified, DAS28 refers to DAS28-CRP.  DAS28 is a composite \nscore that includes 4 variables: \n\u2022 \nTender Joints Count (based on 28 joints - see Appendix B) \n\u2022 \nSwollen Joints Count (based on 28 joints - see Appendix B) \n\u2022 \nGeneral health assessment (GH) by the patient assessed from the ACR RA core set \nquestionnaire (patient global assessment) \n\u2022 \nMarker of inflammation assessed by the hs-CRP. \nIt is a continuous measure allowing for measurement of absolute change in disease burden and \npercentage improvement.  It has been extensively validated for its use in clinical trials and \naccepted by Health Authorities.  The DAS28 can be calculated using the following formula: \nDAS28 = 0.56 x \nTJC\n28\n + 0.28 x  \nSJC\n28\n + 0.36 x Log(CRP+1) + 0.014 x GH + 0.96 \nThe DAS28 provides a number indicating the current activity of the RA.

The method evaluates both joint \nerosions (JE) and joint space narrowing (JSN) in bilateral hand and foot joints. \nThe change from baseline in van der Heijde modified total Sharp score will be evaluated for \npatients who completed the EFC11072 Part B study in order to demonstrate maintenance of \nsarilumab effect on joints.  It will be assessed at week 48, 96, 144 and 192, or at the end of \ntreatment for patients who prematurely discontinue from the study before Week 192. \nNOTE: the sponsor will not perform any medical evaluation on collected X-rays. They will be \nblindly assessed by independent graders and modified Van Der Heijde Total Sharp Score will be \ncalculated per patient per visit. \n9.1.2.5 Physical Function \nImprovement in physical function is assessed by the change from baseline (original study) in \nHAQ-DI at week 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, 264, and EOT, if EOT is prior to Week 264.  It is based \non the HAQ-DI assessment that is completed at each visit by the patient, as one of the ACR \ncomponents. \nThe HAQ-DI is composed of 8 categories as follows: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, \nwalking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities, for which there are at least 2 questions by category. \nThe patient will be asked to score how difficult he/she feels it is to perform such activities using a \n0 to 3 scoring (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and \n3=unable to do). If the patient is using assistance for any of these activities, scoring may be \nadjusted.  For each category, the highest score given for one of the question is attributed to the \ncategory.  The total score is the sum of all categories\u2019 scores divided by the number of answered \ncategories (at least 3 categories should be answered) (see Appendix J). \n9.1.2.6 ACR Components \nEach component of the ACR will be analysed as other secondary outcomes over time.  \nAll ACR components will be assessed up to Week 264.  \nAfter Week 264, TJC and SJC (both based on 28 joints), patient\u00b4s global assessment of disease \nactivity and hs-CRP will still be assessed to calculate DAS28. \n9.1.2.7 Health economic assessment and Patient reported outcomes (PROs)  \n\u2022 Health economic assessments and PROs will be performed up to Week 264 as defined in \nthe initial study and as specified in the study flowchart (See section 1.2). \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 51 \n\u2022 The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue) \nwill be used to assess fatigue. The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire rated 0 to 4 \noriginally developed to measure fatigue in patients with cancer and widely used in \nrheumatoid arthritis patients that demonstrates good consistency and sensitivity to change. \nThe patient will be asked to answer 13 questions rated 0 to 4 (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, \n2 = some what, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much) (see Appendix F). The patient will be asked \nto fill in the questionnaire at different site visits (see flow chart, Section 1.2) \n\u2022 The Work Productivity and Activities Impairment (WPAI) will be assessed for patients \ncoming from EFC11072 and ACT11575 only.  The WPAI was developed by Margaret \nReilly for assessing productivity losses by measuring the effect of general health and \nsymptom severity on work as well as usual activity productivity.  Specific-disease WPAI \nexists and can be adapted to different pathologies.  The RA WPAI (Appendix G): \ninstrument consists of 6 questions that ask the subject the number of hours missed from \nwork (ie, absenteeism) due to RA, the number of hours missed from work for anything \nother than RA, the number of hours totally worked, as well as how much the RA does \naffect the productivity at work or the ability to do daily activities over the past 7 days. The \ninstrument can be self-, interview-, or telephone-administered and takes less than 5 \nminutes to complete (~3 minutes). The 4 scores of the questionnaire are expressed as \nimpairment percentages with higher numbers reflecting greater impairment and decreased \nproductivity. The 4 scores are: \n1. Percent work time missed due to RA \n2. Percent impairment while working due to RA \n3. Percent overall work impairment due to RA \n4. Percent activity impairment due to RA \n\u2022 The WPAI has been tested in many disease states including migraine, arthritis, \nhypertension, diabetes, and depression and is adaptable to specific health problems such as \nRA. Inclusion of this measure in the study assesses the impact of sarilumab on a major \ncomponent of subjects\u2019 lives, which is their ability to perform daily activities and/or be \nable to work. The patient will be asked to fill in the questionnaire at different site visits \n(see flow chart, Section 1.2) \n\u2022 Assessment of joint replacement and joint procedures if any will be performed: total joint \nreplacement (arthroplasty). \n\u2022 Sleep: Rheumatoid arthritis, like other chronic illness, is associated with sleep \ndisturbances. Sleep disturbance is linked to pain, mood, and disease activity. The effect of \nsarilumab on pain will be assessed on a VAS scale (see Appendix H). The patient will be \nasked to fill in the questionnaire at different site visits (see flow chart, Section 1.2) \n\u2022 SF-36: The Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is a generic questionnaire measuring general health \nstatus (quality of life).

As a precautionary measure, investigators \nshould carefully follow any signs of infection with particular care to identify potential infective \ncomplications in immune-suppressed individuals where superficial skin wounds or abrasions may \nlead to serious infections including necrotizing fasciitis and/or sepsis. \nAny infection should be reported by the Investigator as an adverse event and a corresponding \ne-CRF form should be filled in.  Treatment with antibiotics if any should be recorded with the \nroute of administration. \n\u2022 Clinically significant infection: Section 10.5.4 defines clinically significant infections \nthat require pre-specified monitoring and should be reported as adverse events of pre-\nspecified monitoring/adverse events of special interest (AEPM/AESIs) with immediate \nnotification. In case of suspicion of clinically significant infection, a complete diagnosic \nwork-up should be performed including but not limited to cultures for bacterial infections, \nfungi and/or mycobacteria, histopathological or cytological evaluation, antigen detection \nand serum antibody titers. The type of infection should be listed in the e-CRF form.  The \npatient should be referred to a specialist if needed for diagnosis and treatment.  In addition, \nthe study Investigator should determine if the infection qualifies for serious adverse event \nreporting or not.  \n\u2022 Note:  Systemic opportunistic infections should be reported as serious.  \n- \nThe IMP should be temporarily discontinued in case of infection requiring oral or \nparenteral treatment with antibacterial, antiviral and/or antifungal agents (See  \nSection 11.1) or permanently discontinued in case of confirmed opportunistic \ninfections including but not limited to TB. (See Section 11.2.1 and Appendix M). \n\u2022 \nTuberculosis assessment:  Sarilumab is a biologic treatment that may induce \nimmunosuppression, including the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis.  A special \nwarning of the increased risk of tuberculosis is included in the labels of TNF antagonists \nand tocilizumab. \nAs a precautionary measure, patients at risk for tuberculosis will be permanently \ndiscontinued from the study.  \nA clinical examination and history will be performed at every visit to assess any signs and \nsymptoms of tuberculosis or contact with a patient with active tuberculosis. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 58 \nA QuantiFERON TB Gold test can be performed at any time during the course of the \nstudy in case of suspicion of tuberculosis.  A chest X-ray should be performed in all \npatients with suspected tuberculosis. \nIn case of suspicion of TB, the Investigator should refer the patient to a specialist for a \ncomplete examination.  The study drug should be discontinued until TB is ruled out. \nRepeat chest radiographs should be performed as indicated by local treatment guidelines \nor practice for monitoring while on immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy. If \nsuch guidelines are not available/ applicable, a chest X-rays should be performed when \nclinically indicated. \n10.2.2 Demyelinating / Neurological events \nAny demyelinating event or significant, unexplained neurological symptom should be considered \nas an adverse event with prespecified monitoring (see Section 10.5.4). Refer to Section 11.2 for \ndemyelinating/neurological events requiring permanent treatment discontinuation. \nRarely, biologics have been associated with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).  \nThe investigator should check any signs that might be suggestive of a PML at every visit: such as, \nbut not limited to, unusual weakness, loss of coordination, changes in vision, difficulty speaking \nand sometimes personality changes.  In case of suspicion of an event potentially related to a \ndemyelinating event or significant, unexplained neurological symptom during the course of the \nstudy, the patient should be referred to a neurologist for a complete examination.   \n10.2.3 Autoimmunity and Lupus-like syndrome \nAnti DNA antibodies: ANA (Antinuclear antibody) and Anti- double- stranded DNA (Anti- ds-\nDNA) antibody will be performed to assess the effect of sarilumab to induce autoimmune \ndisorders most specifically for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).  Indeed, \nimmunosuppressant agents such as TNF antagonists have been associated with induction of SLE \nand SLE like syndromes.  Anti-ds DNA antibody will be tested only if ANA is positive (\u22651:160 \ntiter). \nThe presence of either of these antibodies may be without clinical consequence or associated with \na clinical syndrome.  Their significance will be determined on a by-patient basis. \nIf a diagnosis of lupus-like syndrome is suspected, this should be reported as an AEPM/AESI (see \nSection 10.5.4). \n10.2.4 Liver Function \nTransient, generally mild, elevation of transaminases has been observed with sarilumab. See the \nClinical Investigator\u2019s Brochure (CIB). \nMoreover, the co-administration of MTX or NSAID may represent an additional risk factor for \nobserving signs of hepatotoxicity which is reflected in the American College of Rheumatology \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 59 \n(ACR) guidelines (12). The investigator is recommended to monitor transaminases in any patient \nreceiving MTX but without any defined threshold for transaminases to start reducing MTX \ndosage which is thus left to the investigator judgement. \nPlease refer to Section 10.5.4 for LFT abnormalities to be reported as AEPM/AESI with or \nwithout immediate notification. \nThe Sponsor relies on the Investigator\u00b4s judgement for adapting concomitant medication, \nincluding dose reduction of MTX dosage, in case of LFT abnormalities within the guidelines \nbelow. \nIn the present protocol, in order to closely follow LFTs, assessment of ALT, AST, alkaline \nphosphatase, prothrombin time, albumin, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin and unconjugated \nbilirubin will be performed per specifications on the study flow chart (see Section 1.2). \n\u2022 \nThe study drug should be permanently discontinued in case of confirmed ALT > 5 ULN or \nin case of confirmed ALT>3 ULN and concomitant total bilirubin >2 ULN (unless the \npatient has a documented Gilbert\u2019s disease).  A complete serological and ultrasonography \nwork-up should be conducted in case of ALT >5 ULN or ALT>3 ULN and concomitant \nbilirubin >2 ULN (see Appendix L). \n\u2022 \nIf ALT \u22653 ULN and \u22645 ULN and bilirubin \u22642 ULN, administration of study drug must be \ntemporarily interrupted, and the study Investigator should immediately contact the patient \nto arrange for repeat LFTs within 48 hours from the Investigator\u2019s awareness of the \nabnormal LFT results: \n- \nIMP should be temporarily interrupted until the ALT is below <3 ULN then restarted \nat the dose of 150 mg q2w at the Investigator\u00b4s discretion. \n- \nLFTs should be repeated according to the provided guideline and at a minimum of \nevery 7 days until conditions for resumption of IMP administration are met (see \nAppendix L).  \n10.2.5 Neutrophils \nRefer to Section 10.5.4 criteria for reporting neutropenia as AEPM/AESI with or without \nimmediate notification. \nFor all patients, a CBC test must be performed a few days before or at Visit 3, but not earlier than \nthe 12th day after the first dose of IMP administration (using either designated central lab or local \nlaboratory facility), and results reviewed prior to the administration of the 2nd dose of study drug \nin order to confirm that the neutrophil count is not within the protocol-defined limits for \ntemporary, or permanent discontinuation of study drug. \nFor all subsequent visits, in order to prevent the administration of study drug in patients at risk for \nsevere neutropenia, whenever the neutrophil count is \u2265 1000/mm3 but less than the lower limit of \nnormal (LLN) based on designated central laboratory test specifications, the CBC test (with \ndifferential) must be repeated to confirm that the neutrophil count is not within the protocol-\n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 60 \ndefined limits for temporary, or permanent discontinuation of study drug, before the next \nadministration of study drug.

Infrequent, mild to \nmoderate, systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with sarilumab.   \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 62 \nPatient at study site visits should be monitored for 30 min after the injection.  Patients that self-\nadminister IMP should be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, and limit \nstrenuous activity for 30 minutes after self-injection.  Any problem should be documented in the \npatient\u2019s diary or medical notes.  In case of systemic hypersensitivity reaction, including \nanaphylaxis (see Appendix O for the clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis), the study drug \nshould be permanently discontinued and the study Investigator should determine if the event \nqualifies for serious adverse event reporting (see Section 10.4 and Section 10.5.2).  If the clinical \ncriteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis are met per Appendix O, then appropriate treatment should be \nadministered immediately and the adverse event must be reported as an SAE and AEPM/AESI \nwith immediate notification. \n10.2.8 Diverticulitis and Gastrointestinal perforation  \nGastrointestinal perforations have been reported as complications in patients with diverticulitis \nwho have been treated with tocilizumab.   \nGastro-intestinal perforation is an AESI with immediate notification to be reported as SAE.  \nConfirmed diverticulitis or gastrointestinal ulceration should be reported as AESI without \nimmediate notification (see Section 10.5.4). \nThe Investigator should pay particular attention to all gastrointestinal symptoms such as, but not \nlimited to, abdominal pain, haemorrhage or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever to \nassure that the diagnosis is not missed and that the conditions are managed appropriately to avoid \nthe complication of perforation.  If necessary, the patient should be referred to a specialist.   \nCorticosteroid use or prior history of diverticulitis is known to increase the risk of gastrointestinal \nperforations. The Investigator should be aware of this potential risk and monitor any sign of \ndiverticulitis. \n10.2.9 Acute renal failure \nSee Appendix L.

Such events may require \nfurther investigation in order to characterize and understand them. The AESI/AEPMs may be \nadded or removed during a study by protocol amendment. \nA Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: \n\u2022 \nResults in death or; \n\u2022 \nIs life-threatening or; \nNote:  The term \u201clife-threatening\u201d in the definition of \u201cserious\u201d refers to an event in which the \npatient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which \nhypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization \nor prolongation of existing hospitalization or \n\u2022 \nResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or \n\u2022 \nIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect \n\u2022 \nIs a medically important event: \nMedical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is \nappropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately \nlife-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require \nintervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes \nlisted in the definition above. \nNote:  The following medical important events intend to serve as a guideline for determining \nwhich condition has to be considered as a medically important event.

The \nInvestigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, \ncorrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome and his/her \nopinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or the \nNIMP (not assessed in EFC13752 patients). \nThe Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery is \ncomplete and laboratory results have returned to normal (or baseline), or until progression has \nbeen stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that \nobservations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional \ninvestigations may be requested by the Sponsor.  \n\u2022 \nPatients who experience an ongoing SAE or an AESI with immediate notification, at the \npre-specified study end-date, should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death \nand related data will be collected.  \nWhen treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient\u2019s observations will continue until the end \nof the study as defined by the protocol for that patient. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n1.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol 9  \n31-Aug-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210  \nVersion number:  1 \nProperty of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential \nPage 65 \nLaboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are medically \nrelevant: symptomatic or requiring either corrective treatment or consultation or leading to \ndiscontinuation or modification of dosing and/or fulfilling a seriousness criterion and/or is defined \nas an AE with pre-specified monitoring (AEPM/AESI). \n10.5.2 Serious Adverse Events \nIn the case of a serious adverse event the Investigator must immediately: \n\u2022 \nENTER (within 24 hours of knowledge) the information related to the SAE in the \nappropriate screens of the e-CRF; the system will automatically send the notification to the \nMonitoring Team after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard \ndelay. \n\u2022 \nSEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) the photocopy of all examinations carried out and the \ndates on which these examinations were performed, to the representative of the \nMonitoring Team whose name, fax number and email address appear on the Clinical Trial \nProtocol.

To mimic the real-world practice, the sub-study was designed to incorporate into the LTS11210 study without additional visits compare to scheduled visits in the main study. The primary endpoint is the number of product technical failures (PTF), which is defined as any product technical complaint (PTC) that has a validated technical cause. A PTC is defined as any patient- or healthcare provider-reported complaint regarding the use of the PFS-S syringe and collected via the completion of the injection diary.  In addition, the safety information of sarilumab 150 mg q2w PFS-S and 200 mg q2w PFS-S will be collected throughout the sub-study period and trough concentrations of sarilumab will be measured at entry into the sub-study and at the end of the 12-week sub-study period.

The entry into the sub-study (V101) will be at any scheduled visit in the main study from Visit 8 (Week 24) or after. Sarilumab 150 mg q2w PFS-S or sarilumab 200 mg q2w PFS-S will be used in the sub-study to replace the sarilumab 150 mg q2w PFS or 200mg q2w PFS used in the main study. At the entry into the sub-study (V101), the patients will be trained how to use the PFS-S, and the sub-study injection diary will be dispensed to replace the patient diary of the main study. All the procedures described in the sub-study are additional to the main study activities, unless specified to replace procedures in the main study. The person performing each sub-study injection will respond to 3 questions related to PFS-S use on the injection diary (See Section 9.1) after each PFS-S injection. A \u201cno\u201d response to any question will be defined as a PTC. For any PTC, the Investigator will complete a PTC form and will send this PTC form together with the PFS-S that triggered this PTC back to the Sponsor according to a predefined process (Section 12). The patients should be instructed to keep any PFS-S associated with a PTC separately from other PFS-S, so it can be identified when returned to site at the end of sub-study. For patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg q2w PFS-S the dose can be reduced any time during the sub-study duration if the main protocol defined criteria for dose reduction are fulfilled. When the patients have completed the 12 weeks of the sub-study they will return to the clinic to complete Visit 102 in addition to the scheduled main study visit on that day. They will switch back to the main study and continue sarilumab PFS treatment.  If the patient chooses to end the participation in the sub-study during the sub-study duration but to continue in the main study the Visit V102 should still be completed. If a patient discontinues Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) permanently in LTS11210 during the sub-study, he/she should complete all procedures planned for V102 in the sub-study as well as the end of treatment (EOT) and post treatment follow-up visits in the main study (see flowchart in main study Section 1.2).
