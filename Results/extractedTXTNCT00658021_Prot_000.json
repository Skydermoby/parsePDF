                        "Content": " Exenatide (BYETTA\uf6da) is the first in a class of medicines called incretin mimetics.  Exenatide enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cell, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying.  Exenatide has been approved for use in the United States (US) as an adjunctive therapy to diet and exercise for adults with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control and in the European Union (EU) for adults with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control despite treatment with metformin, a sulfonylurea (SU), or combination of metformin, thiazolidinedione (TZD), and an SU.  BYETTA is administered twice daily, subcutaneously (SC), at least 6 hours apart, before the 2 main meals of the day. Incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and exhibit other antihyperglycemic actions following their release into the circulation from the gut (Drucker 2001).  When administered in vivo, exenatide, a 39 amino acid peptide, mimics certain antihyperglycemic actions of GLP-1.  Exenatide has been shown to bind to and activate the known human GLP-1 receptor in vitro, which leads to an increase in both glucose-dependent synthesis of insulin, and in vivo secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells, by mechanisms involving cyclic adenosine monophosphate and/or other intracellular signaling pathways.  Exenatide promotes insulin release from beta cells in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations.  Exenatide improves glycemic control by reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes through the following multiple mechanisms of action: \u2022 Insulin secretion:  Exenatide has acute effects on pancreatic beta cell responsiveness to glucose and leads to insulin release only in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations (Parkes et al. 2001; Kolterman et al. 2003).  This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia.  In healthy individuals, robust insulin secretion occurs during the first 10 minutes following intravenous (IV) glucose administration.  This secretion, known as the \u201cfirst-phase insulin response,\u201d is characteristically absent in most patients with type 2 diabetes.  The loss of the first-phase insulin response is an early beta cell defect in type 2 diabetes.  Administration of exenatide at therapeutic plasma concentrations restored first-phase insulin response to an IV H8O-MC-GWBQ(e) Clinical Protocol \nPage 11 \n \n \nbolus of glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes.  Both first-phase insulin \nsecretion and second-phase insulin secretion were significantly increased in \npatients with type 2 diabetes treated with exenatide compared with saline \n(p<.001 for both). \n\u2022 Glucagon secretion:  In patients with type 2 diabetes, exenatide suppresses \nglucagon secretion and lowers serum glucagon concentrations during periods of \nhyperglycemia (Gedulin et al. 1999).  Lower glucagon concentrations lead to \ndecreased hepatic glucose output and decreased insulin demand.  However, \nexenatide does not impair the normal glucagon response to hypoglycemia (Degn \net al. 2004).  \n\u2022 Gastric emptying:  Exenatide slows gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at \nwhich meal-derived glucose appears in the circulation (Jodka et al. 1998; \nKolterman et al. 2003).  \n\u2022 Food intake:  In both animals and humans, administration of exenatide has been \nshown to reduce food intake (Edwards et al. 2001).  \nThe effect of exenatide is immediate with respect to its effect on hyperglycemia in the fasting \nstate.  In addition, a single dose of exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly reduces \nthe abnormal rise in postprandial glucose concentrations. \nThe main risks associated with exenatide treatment include mild or moderate nausea (for \napproximately half of treated patients) that is more frequent at the initiation of therapy and an \nincreased risk of mild or moderate hypoglycemia if the patient is also using an SU.  \nApproximately 43% of adult patients taking exenatide exhibit a temporal rise in antibodies to \nexenatide, which are mostly of low titer (<1/125).  In about 3% of all patients in the three 30-\nweek registration trials, the formation of antibodies to exenatide at high titers was associated \nwith failure to achieve adequate improvement in glycemic control.  Postmarketing reports have \nlinked exenatide use to acute pancreatitis and to altered renal function.  As it is eliminated by the \nkidneys, exenatide should not be used by patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage \nrenal disease.   \nType 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of all new cases of diabetes in adolescents \n(Dietz and Robinson 2005).  Evidence has shown that a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in \nchildhood, coupled with inadequate glycemic control, increases the risk of early mortality as well \nas early end organ damage (Cavallo 2006).  The current study will investigate the safety and \nefficacy of exenatide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adolescents, and will provide \nimportant information on the potential clinical use of exenatide in that population. \nMore detailed information about the known benefits and risks of exenatide may be found in the \nInvestigator\u2019s Brochure (IB). \nH8O-MC-GWBQ(e) Clinical Protocol Page 12   ",

                        "Content": " Insulin and metformin are currently the only approved drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adolescents.  It is important to identify additional safe and effective diabetes therapies for this age group.  The current study will include patients who are na\u00efve to antidiabetes drug therapy, defined as treatment with diet and exercise alone, and patients previously treated with metformin, an SU, or both (with or without diet and exercise).  Although SU use is not an approved therapy for adolescents, published reports have described its clinical use in this age group (Bloomgarden 2004; Von and Hewett 2007).  Since a monotherapy indication for exenatide exists in the US for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes, such use might also be of benefit in adolescents with type 2 diabetes.   A recent study (Study 2993-124) in 13 adolescent patients with type 2 diabetes investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of exenatide in patients between the ages of 10 and 16 with type 2 diabetes and an average body mass index (BMI) of 32.5 (range: 23.2 to 40.8).  Consistent with clinical trials in adults, exenatide 5 \u00b5g nearly eliminated postprandial glucose excursions in adolescents.  Exenatide was well-tolerated, with 1 patient who experienced moderate gastrointestinal events.  No hypoglycemic events were reported.  Thus, it appears that the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of exenatide 5 \u00b5g in adolescents are comparable to those observed in adults.  Therefore, the 5- and 10-\u00b5g doses of exenatide will be included in this study, both compared with placebo.  H8O-MC-GWBQ(e) Clinical Protocol Page 13   ",

Approximately 195 adolescents, ages 10 to 17 years inclusive, with type 2 diabetes will be enrolled.  However, the number of patients \u226517 years of age will be limited to no more than 10% of patients in each treatment arm.  The patients will be na\u00efve to antidiabetes agents, or they will be receiving oral treatment with metformin, an SU, or a combination of metformin and an SU at the time of enrollment.  Randomization will be stratified by the patient\u2019s background diabetes therapy and screening HbA1c.  The study will commence with a 1-week, single-blind, injectable placebo lead-in period before patients are randomly assigned to add injectable exenatide or injectable placebo to their existing diabetes treatment.  Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms:  exenatide 5 \u00b5g twice daily, exenatide 10 \u00b5g twice daily, or placebo twice daily (volume of injection equivalent to exenatide 5 \u00b5g or exenatide 10 \u00b5g).  During the first 4 weeks after randomization, all patients assigned to treatment will receive exenatide 5 \u00b5g twice daily or equivalent placebo volume twice daily.  A starting dose of exenatide 5 \u00b5g twice daily and titration to exenatide 10 \u00b5g twice daily has been shown to mitigate the incidence of nausea.  At the end of 4 weeks post-randomization, patients assigned to the exenatide 10 \u00b5g twice daily treatment arm, or equivalent placebo volume, are then to increase their dose from 5 \u00b5g twice daily to 10 \u00b5g twice daily, or equivalent placebo volume.  Study drug will be administered within 60 minutes before morning and evening meals (or the 2 main meals of the day, approximately 6 hours or more apart) for 28 weeks.  All patients will be expected to participate in a simplified lifestyle modification program (LMP) throughout this study (Attachment 4).  The simplified lifestyle modification program will include both dietary education and physical activity components.  At the clinic visits, the patients will meet with a study registered dietitian (RD) or certified diabetes educator (CDE) who will review the patient\u2019s dietary history and physical activity record.  The LMP will be reinforced at each visit. Patients who are discontinued due to loss of glycemic control will be offered alternative antidiabetes therapy at the discretion of the investigator.

Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms:  exenatide 5 \u00b5g twice daily, exenatide 10 \u00b5g twice daily, or placebo twice daily in a double-blind manner.  Patients randomized to placebo will be assigned to take the volume equivalent to exenatide 5 \u00b5g or to take the volume equivalent to exenatide10 \u00b5g.

Patients will receive injection pens of exenatide or placebo.  Patients will be reinstructed on how to use their injection pen; however, they will not administer their first dose of the assigned therapy until the evening of Visit 3 (within 60 minutes before their evening meal).  Dosing of patients participating in the pharmacokinetic addendum at Visit 3 will be altered from that in the main protocol.  Patients will administer their first dose of the assigned therapy at Visit 3 (approximately 15 minutes before receipt of first meal at the clinic).  Patients taking part in the pharmacokinetic addendum are not required to take an evening dose as per protocol.  All injections of study drug (placebo and exenatide) will be SC into the abdomen.

These glucose measurements should be recorded along with study drug dose in the patient diaries.  In addition to these requested glucose measurements, patients will be encouraged to measure daily fasting glucose values at home.  The diaries are considered source documents and are to be returned to the investigator at the clinic visit.  If a patient fails to perform any of the aforementioned measurements, this will not constitute a protocol violation. Also occurring at Visits 3 and 11, will be the collection of CEA and calcitonin.

Approximately 195 patients will be enrolled.  Patients will be eligible to participate if they are not achieving adequate glycemic control (HbA1c 6.5% to 10.5%, inclusive) with metformin, an SU, or metformin and an SU, or diet and exercise only.  Patients will be stratified to treatment assignment based on diabetes therapy at enrollment and screening HbA1c.  The three-arm design is intended to allow comparison of exenatide at doses of 5 \u00b5g twice daily and 10 \u00b5g twice daily with placebo twice daily. The primary endpoint for treatment will be assessed at 28 weeks.  This timing is intended to allow patients to achieve a stable, representative HbA1c on study treatment.  It is expected that exenatide will be more efficacious than placebo when added to the patient\u2019s current diabetes H8O-MC-GWBQ(e) Clinical Protocol \nPage 20 \n \n \ntherapy.  Consequently, the study is designed to show superiority of exenatide compared with \nplacebo.  Fasting serum glucose, fasting serum insulin concentrations, and body weight \nassessments will also be used to support the assessment of overall metabolic efficacy.   \nSite visits and telephone contacts are included in the study to provide opportunities for patients \nto discuss any questions that they have regarding study drug, injections, or study procedures.   \nInvestigators will be instructed to maintain patients on stable doses of metformin and an SU so \nthat treatment arm differences can be attributed to study treatment rather than other agents.  For \npatients using an SU, the SU dose may be reduced if hypoglycemic episodes occur, and \neventually stopped, if hypoglycemia continues.   \nFor some patients, glycemic control may decline.  Therefore, it is important that the adolescent \npatients in this study whose HbA1c significantly deteriorates receive active therapy.  As a result, \nany patient whose absolute HbA1c value increases by \u22650.5% from baseline at 2 consecutive \nscheduled visits which are at least one month apart, despite standard counseling and education \navailable to all study participants at each visit, will be discontinued from the study.  Another \ncriterion for discontinuation due to loss of glycemic control will be based on home glucose \nmonitoring.  A patient whose fasting blood glucose is >250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) or non-fasting \nglucose is >300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) for 4 days during a 7-day period, as measured by home \nSMBG, will return to the clinic for a confirmatory fasting or non-fasting glucose (measured by a \nlocal laboratory).

Lack of drug effect is not an adverse event in clinical trials because the purpose of the clinical trial is to establish drug effect. Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug or drug delivery system should be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast-feeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.

The model will include change in HbA1c as the dependent variable and treatment, screening HbA1c strata (\u22648% and >8%), baseline HbA1c, background diabetes therapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin, an SU, and a combination of metformin and an SU), week of visit, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects and patient as the random effects.  The plan for determining a covariance structure to be used for this model will be described in the SAP.  All post-baseline measurements of the change in HbA1c will be included in the analysis with no imputation of missing data other than that inherent in the MMRM model.  If the last efficacy measurement is collected at a visit for which the efficacy measurement is not planned to be collected, the measurement collected at the early termination visit will be mapped to the following planned visit.  Using SAS\u00ae PROC MIXED, least squares (LS) means and 95% confidence interval will be produced from the model to estimate the magnitudes of treatment effects.  The p-value for the overall test for differences among treatments will be obtained directly from the MMRM analysis.  Pairwise comparisons between each exenatide treatment and placebo will be obtained from the MMRM model.  Inferences will be based on the estimate of the treatment difference at Week 28.

The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water. NOTE:   In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, in order to make a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, these criteria should be confirmed by repeat testing on a different day.   The OGTT is not recommended for routine clinical use, but may be required in the evaluations of patients with impaired fasting glucose or when diabetes is still suspected despite a normal FPG. The use of the hemoglobin A1c (A1C) for the diagnosis of diabetes is not recommended at this time. *ADA\u2019s Clinical Practice Recommendations 2007 H8O-MC-GWBQ(e) Clinical Protocol Page 55   ",

                "Content": " A simplified lifestyle modification program (LMP) will be recommended for all patients participating in study GWBQ.  The LMP consists of a diet and exercise component suggested to be followed throughout the duration of the study.  This program will address the dietary and physical activity needs of the individual.  A qualified person (i.e.) Registered Dietitian (RD) or Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) will meet with the patient and parent or guardian at each scheduled clinic visit.  The LMP will be reinforced at each visit. The study LMP for sites located in the U.S. will be based on the \u201cMyPlate Plan\u201d, a program designed by the United States Department of Agriculture and available to the public at www.ChooseMyPlate.gov.  The qualified person at each site will enter each patient\u2019s age, gender, weight and height into the SuperTracker program calculator.  The program will calculate the total daily calories recommended to be consumed to promote at least minimal weight loss and to meet growth needs.  The MyPlate Plan will also be used to calculate the number of daily meal servings from each food group in the plan.   The qualified person can individualize the MyPlate Plan using clinical judgment to promote compliance with the meal plans and physical activity throughout the study.  At each clinic visit, individualized tools can be given to the patient with a copy retained by the qualified person. For countries other than the US, the study LMP will be based on the \u201cMyPlate Plan\u201d or other locally applicable plan. Visit 2 (Beginning of the placebo lead-in period)   The qualified person will meet with the patient and parent or guardian beginning at Visit 2 of the study.  The qualified person will introduce and review the MyPlate with the patient and parent/guardian, explaining the recommended number of calories, food groups, portion sizes, and individualizing the plan to aid patient compliance.  The patient will be given at least three food and exercise worksheets.  The patient will be instructed to complete a minimum of one of the worksheets with at least two weekdays and one weekend day of food consumption and exercise. The patient will be instructed to complete the worksheet prior to Visit 3 and bring the worksheet with them to the next clinic visit.   The qualified person will instruct the patients on the importance of a minimum of 60 minutes of daily exercise (walking, jogging, biking, hiking, sport activity, etc) and limiting sedentary activities (watching TV, video games) to one hour or less daily.   Visit 3 (Randomization) through Visit 10  The qualified person will meet with the patient and parent/guardian to collect and review the food and exercise worksheets, during clinic visits.  The qualified person will evaluate adherence to the LMP and address any areas of concern.  The patient\u2019s weight will be noted at each clinic H8O-MC-GWBQ(e) Clinical Protocol \nPage 56 \n \n \nvisit to help assess diet and exercise compliance.  The qualified person will re-instruct patient on \nproblem areas, as appropriate.  The qualified person will reinforce positive changes and \nencourage the patient to adhere to both the diet and exercise recommendations.  The patient will \nbe given at least three food and exercise worksheets.  The patient will be instructed to complete a \nminimum of two of the worksheets with at least two weekdays and one weekend day of food \nconsumption and exercise.  The patient will be instructed to complete the worksheets prior to the \nclinic visit and bring the worksheets with them to the next clinic visit.  During the phone visits \nthe patient may speak with the qualified person on the LMP if requested. \nVisit 11 (End of study treatment) \nThe qualified person will meet with the patient and parent/guardian and collect the food and \nexercise worksheets.  The patient should be encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle after the \npatient ends study treatment and enters the safety follow-up period, at the discretion of the \ninvestigator.  \nFootnote: Failure to return food and exercise worksheets will not, at any time, be considered a protocol violation. \n \nH8O-MC-GWBQ(e) Clinical Protocol Page 57   ",

Rationale for Addendum \nIn response to a request from the European Medicines Agency Paediatric Committee, patients \nwill be observed in a long-term safety follow-up period following discontinuation of study drug \nadministration.  Patients will return to the clinic every 6 months for evaluation on safety \nmeasures.  Patients will be followed for up to 3 years after the completion of the treatment \nperiod, or until the difference between 2 consecutive height measurements at 6-month intervals is \nless than 5 mm (whichever occurs first).  Patients who have achieved the final height \nrequirement of a change of less than 5 mm between Visit 3 and Visit 11 of the treatment period \nwill be excluded from the safety follow-up period.  Patients who do not have height assessments \nat study-site visits over a 6-month interval prior to discontinuation of study medication will enter \nthe safety follow-up period.  Long-term follow-up of patients will allow observation of ongoing \ndevelopment and growth on an individual patient basis and a description of the occurrence of \nselected adverse events (AEs) in pediatric patients in the absence of study drug treatment \nfollowing up to 28 weeks of study drug administration. \n \nH8O-MC-GWBQ(4) Clinical Protocol Addendum \nPage 6 \n \nSafety Follow-up Addendum \nAmendment (a) to Addendum (4) \n4. Protocol Additions \n4.1. Long-Term Safety Follow-Up Objective \nThe objectives of the safety follow-up period are as follows: \n\uf0b7 To describe safety parameters over time following discontinuation of study drug \nadministration, including the following: \n\uf0b7 Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) \n\uf0b7 Ongoing prescription medication \n\uf0b7 Height and weight \n\uf0b7 Tanner pubertal stage \n\uf0b7 Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration \n\uf0b7 Calcitonin concentration \n4.2. Summary of Study Design \nFollowing discontinuation of study drug administration, patients with a height difference of at \nleast 5 mm between Visit 3 and Visit 11 will enter the safety follow-up period.  Patients who \ndiscontinue study drug administration prior to Visit 11 will also enter the safety follow-up \nperiod.  During this period, patients will return to the study site at approximately 6-month \nintervals for a period of up to 3 years or until the difference between 2 height measurements over \na 6-month interval is less than 5 mm (whichever comes first).  Patients who do not have height \nassessments at study-site visits over a 6-month interval prior to discontinuation of study \nmedication will enter the safety follow-up period.  Patients will not receive any study drug but \nmay be treated with a diabetes treatment regimen deemed appropriate by the investigator or \nhealthcare provider.  During the safety follow-up period, the following will occur:  AESIs and \nongoing prescription medications will be reviewed; height, weight, and Tanner pubertal stage \nwill be assessed; and CEA and calcitonin concentrations will be measured.  Refer to the Study \nSchedule (Attachment 1) for more information.   \nPatients who have achieved the final height requirement of a change of less than 5 mm between \nVisit 3 and Visit 11 of the treatment period will be excluded from the safety follow-up period. \nPatients who completed the protocol prior to this addendum will be evaluated for inclusion in the \nsafety follow-up period where possible (Section 4.2.1.1).   \nThe entire study design including the safety extension period is illustrated in Figure GWBQ(4) 1. \nH8O-MC-GWBQ(4) Clinical Protocol Addendum \nPage 7 \n \nSafety Follow-up Addendum \nAmendment (a) to Addendum (4) \nAbbreviations:  BID = twice a day \na Metformin (Met) or sulfonylurea (SU) or combination of Met and SU, with or without diet and exercise, or na\u00efve \nto antidiabetic agents defined as being treated with diet and exercise alone. \nb The volume of placebo is equivalent to 5 \u03bcg or 10 \u03bcg exenatide. \nc Scheduled telephone visit. \nd Patients will return to the study site at approximately 6-month intervals for a period of up to 3 years or until the \ndifference between 2 height measurements over a 6-month interval is less than 5 mm (whichever comes first).  \nPatients who do not have height assessments at study-site visits over a 6-month interval prior to discontinuation of \nstudy medication will enter the safety follow-up period.  Patients will not receive any study drug but may be \ntreated with a diabetes treatment regimen deemed appropriate by the investigator or healthcare provider. \nFigure GWBQ(4) 1.

Patients Previously Completing the Protocol or Early Withdrawal \nPatients who previously completed the protocol or withdrew early from the study will be \nevaluated for participation in the safety follow-up period.  Patients who completed the 28-week \nstudy and grew less than 5 mm during the treatment period (between Visits 3 and 11) will be \nexcluded, while early withdrawal patients will be included in the safety follow-up period.  \nPatients who are eligible to participate in the safety follow-up will be contacted to return to the \nclinic and parent or legal guardian informed consent and patient assent will be obtained.  Patients \nwill be observed until either they achieve the height requirement or it has been 3 years since their \nlast dose in the treatment period.  Patients will not receive study drug during the 3-year follow-\nup period and will be allowed to go on any diabetes treatment regimen deemed appropriate by \nthe investigator or healthcare provider. \n4.3.

Pregnancies that occur during the safety follow-up period \nshould be reported and followed to term. \n4.6. Statistical and Analytical Plans \n4.6.1. General Considerations \nSafety data will be listed for the safety follow-up population, which will consist of all patients \nwho participate in at least 1 safety follow-up period visit. \nData collected in the safety follow-up period is for descriptive purposes and is not associated \nwith a predefined hypothesis or test.  Missing data will not be imputed. \n \nH8O-MC-GWBQ(4) Clinical Protocol Addendum \nPage 10 \n \nSafety Follow-up Addendum \nAmendment (a) to Addendum (4) \nAttachment 1.
