                        "Content": " Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death globally with estimated one million new cases diagnosed and 880,000 deaths each year. The prognosis for advanced Stage disease has not changed significantly in the past 20 years. With an overall 5- year survival rate of only 15%, the treatment of this disease remains a major clinical challenge (R05-0876).  In patients with advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIB pleural effusion or Stage IV metastatic disease) systemic chemotherapy is considered the first line treatment of choice, prolonging the median survival and palliating tumour-related symptoms (R05-0876). In an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial, platinum-based doublets achieved an objective response in approximately 20% of advanced NSCLC patients and prolonged median survival to 7.9 months with a one-year survival rate of 33% and a two-year survival rate of 11% (R04-1314). Currently, several different platinum-based doublet combinations are in use worldwide as historically there has been no globally recognised superior regimen.   While systemic chemotherapy has demonstrated modest activity in advanced NSCLC, novel targeted therapies based on specific molecular and biological characteristics of lung cancer have emerged as a new treatment paradigm. The targets most extensively studied include the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) or the Subclass I of the superfamily of transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (R06-1302, R07-1049, R07-1135). The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor was the first member to be cloned and is the most biologically relevant receptor for NSCLC. The erbB signaling system now comprises four closely related tyrosine kinase receptors: human epidermal growth factor receptor 1, HER 1 (erbB1/EGFR), HER2 (erbB2), HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4) (R06-1301, R06-1302). Growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), bind to EGFR and trigger the dimerisation of two EGFR molecules or the heterodimerisation with other closely related receptors, such as HER2. Autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation of the EGFR through its tyrosine kinase domain leads to the recruitment of downstream effector molecules and the activation of multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways. Activation of these signalling cascades is essential for controlling malignant cell growth and metastasis (R06-1262, R06-1301, R06-1302).  Aberrant activation of EGFR is frequently observed in a variety of malignant tumours and can be caused by different molecular mechanisms including mutations, receptor over-expression, ligand-dependent receptor dimerisation, and ligand-independent activation. Over-expression of EGFR is detected in 40% to 80% of NSCLC and this has led to the development of specific small molecule EGFR antagonists (R06-1301, R06-1393, R06- 1394). First-generation EGFR small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) act as ATP analogues, competing reversibly for the tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic site, and include gefitinib (Iressa\u00ae) and erlotinib (Tarceva\u00ae).  Despite the high levels of EGFR over-expression in tumours in the majority of patients with NSCLC, recent clinical experiences with specific EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have  Final,  22 Jan 2010 BI Trial No.:  Trial Protocol Page       Boehringer Ingelheim1200.3416demonstrated tumour regression in only 10% to 15% of unselected NSCLC patients (R05- \n0867, R06-1301, R06-1306). Further analysis has demonstrated that an objective tumour \nresponse to TKI therapy is more likely to occur in Asian females with adenocarcinomas \n(often with bronchoalveolar differentiation) and with a history of modest or no cigarette \nsmoking (R06-1259, R06-1306, R06-1395, R07-1049). \n \nFurther investigations in patients who respond to TKI therapy have indicated that the \nsensitivity to therapy may correlate with the presence of EGFR activating mutations. \nSequence analysis of tissue samples from NSCLC patients responsive to TKI therapy \nrevealed approximately 30 different somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of \nEGFR (R06-1262, R06-1393). The frequency of EGFR somatic mutations in the general \nNSCLC population was found to be approximately 10% in patients from the US, Europe or \nAustralia and up to 30% in patients from Japan and Taiwan (R06-1262, R06-1306, R06- \n1393). \n \nSpecific mutations sensitising EGFR to TKI therapy are either short, in-frame nucleotide \ndeletions, in-frame duplications/insertions or single-nucleotide substitutions clustered around \nthe region of the ATP binding-pocket of the receptor tyrosine kinase domain (R04-4507, \nR06-1311, R07-1134, R07-1135). The two most common mutations, accounting for more \nthan 90% of known sensitising EGFR mutations in NSCLC specimens result in an in-frame \ndeletion, including the amino acids at codons 746 to 750 (E746 to A750) in Exon 19 and a \npoint mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution at codon 858 (L858R) in Exon 21 \n(R04-4507, R06-1311, R06-1393, R07-1134, R07-1135). Structural analysis has revealed that \nthese mutations lead to a conformational change within the kinase domain, narrowing of the \nATP binding cleft and result in enhanced ligand-dependent receptor activation (R06-1264). In \naddition, these mutations result in stabilisation of both ATP and competitive small molecule \ninhibitors within the binding pocket. \n \nRetrospective analyses of studies have indicated that patients with activating Exon 19 and \nExon 21 EGFR mutations have a higher response rate and a prolonged survival following \ntreatment with single-agent TKIs compared to patients with wild-type EGFR (R06-1306, \nR06-1311, R06-1406, R08-4128). Several prospective phase II studies have investigated \nfurther the use of TKIs in patients harbouring EGFR mutations (R06-1310, R06-1458, R06- \n1459, R08-4048, R08-4078, R08-4049). The median PFS observed in these studies ranged \nfrom 8.9 months to 12 months, with response rates of between 55% and 90%. Overall \nsurvival of up to 24 months has been observed in patients with EGFR mutations receiving \ncustomised treatment (R08-4049). The largest cumulative series to date is a combined \nanalysis from seven trials of first-line gefitinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations \n(R08-4050). This analysis included 148 patients and demonstrated a PFS of 9.7 months and a \nresponse rate of 76.4%. \n \nThe IPASS trial is a phase III randomized trial of gefitinib versus carboplatin/paclitaxel \nchemotherapy as first-line treatment for Asian patients selected based on demographic \nfeatures associated with a higher frequency of mutations (adenocarcinoma, never or light \nexsmokers) (R08-4132). Recently presented data from this trial indicated that the median \nprogression-free survival (PFS) was equivalent in the two treatment arms (5.7 months with \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n17\ngefitinib versus 5.8 months with carboplatin/ paclitaxel) (R09-4437). A subgroup of the \noverall population was tested for EGFR mutation status and an analysis was performed on \nthis subgroup. Amongst the patients tested, the rate of mutation observed was 60%. Patients \nwho tested positive for EGFR mutation had a significantly higher response rate when treated \nwith gefitinib (71.2%) compared to treatment with carboplatin/ paclitaxel (47.3%). Patients \nwho tested negative for EGFR mutation had a significantly higher response rate when treated \nwith carboplatin/ paclitaxel (23.5%) compared to treatment with gefitinib (1.1%). Similarly \nwhen compared to chemotherapy, PFS was significantly longer in the presence of EGFR \nmutations (HR=0.48) and significantly shorter in the absence of EGFR mutations (HR=2.85) \nin the gefitinib arm. These results strongly suggest that the use of single agent TKIs for first-\nline therapy may only be of value in patients with EGFR mutations but that in this group of \npatients, treatment with single-agent TKIs may be more beneficial than chemotherapy. \n \nThe efficacy of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations depends on the type \nof mutation. Patients with one of the two most common mutations, Exon 19 deletions and \nL858R, have the highest response rates (84.2%) whereas patients with other, less common, \nmutations have lower response rates of less than 20% (R08-4109). \n \nIn trial 1200.34, patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR mutation will \nbe randomized to receive either Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy or the irreversible \nEGFR small molecule inhibitor BIBW 2992. \n \nBIBW 2992 is a member of the second generation of TKIs which bind irreversibly to EGFR \nand HER2 and are thought to have potential benefit over first generation TKIs such as \nerlotinib and gefitinib. One of the reasons for the potential benefit is that BIBW 2992 may \nhave activity against mutations which are resistant to the first generation TKIs (U03-3218). \nAdditionally the irreversible binding may confer more prolonged activity further delaying \ntumour progression when compared to reversible TKIs. \n \nDespite initially promising responses, most patients treated with currently available \nEGFRTKI therapies will eventually develop disease progression. Molecular analyses of \nrelapsed NSCLC samples from this group of patients have demonstrated an EGFR mutation \nrendering the tumour cells resistant to EGFR-TKI therapy (R06-1263, R06-1264, R06-1265, \nR06-1266, R06-1393). This specific mutation in Exon 20 causes a single base pair change \nleading to a threonine to methionine amino acid alteration in position 790 (T790M). This \nspecific threonine residue at position 790 serves as the \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 deep in the catalytic \nATP-binding site of the kinase domain. The bulkier methionine side chain confers drug \nresistance to the tumour cells by sterically hindering the access of TKIs such as erlotinib or \ngefitinib to the ATP binding site (R06-1264). \n \nStudies of tumour biopsies taken at diagnosis have shown that the T790M is rarely detected \nprior to treatment with EGFR TKIs (R06-1405). However, a recent study of EGFR mutations \nin circulating tumour cells detected the T790M mutation in 38% of patients prior to \ncommencing treatment (R08-4065). The authors also observed that the T790M mutation was \npresent at a relatively low frequency, suggesting that it is present in only a sub-clone of cells \nand may not be detected by conventional techniques. Following treatment with TKIs, the \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n18\nT790M mutation is detectable in approximately 50% of NSCLC with acquired resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib (R06-1264).  One of the proposed strategies to prevent or overcome the acquired resistance to TKI therapy in malignant tumours is the use of small molecule inhibitors with higher binding affinity, i.e., irreversible kinase inhibitors (R06-1263, R06-1389, R06-1390, R06-1391, R07-1135, R07- 1162). Recently published experimental data strongly support this strategy (R06-1307). Bronchioloalveolar NCI-H1650 NSCLC cells in vitro rapidly developed resistance to gefitinib but not to the irreversible EGFR inhibitors HKI-357, HKI-272, and EKB-569. Moreover, stable over-expression of T790M mutant EGFR conferred high-level biochemical resistance to the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib in Ba/F3 murine hematopoietic progenitor cells that remain sensitive to the irreversible EGFR small molecule inhibitor CL-367,785 (R06-1390). BIBW 2992 also belongs to this class of irreversible kinase inhibitors and has recently shown in vitro activity against NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing the T790M mutation (P08-06904). BIBW 2992 also demonstrated activity in xenograft and transgenic lung cancer models expressing the T790M mutation. In the same experiment these xenografts were resistant to lapatinib and gefitinib (P08-06904).  These preclinical data support the hypothesis that BIBW 2992 may be more efficacious in the treatment of tumours harbouring EGFR mutations than the currently available TKIs.  ",

                        "Content": " BIBW 2992 is a highly selective and potent low molecular weight, irreversible inhibitor of the erbB-family of tyrosine kinase receptors EGFR (erbB1 / HER1) and HER 2 (erbB2). All references in this protocol concerning BIBW 2992 refer to the oral formulation (U03-3218).  The potency of BIBW 2992 was determined in enzymatic assays using recombinant human wild-type EGFR (IC50 0.5 nM) and HER2 (IC50 14 nm) (U03-3218). A panel of recombinant human kinases tested in parallel was not inhibited, demonstrating the high target specificity of BIBW 2992 (U03-3218). Molecular modeling revealed that BIBW 2992 binds covalently and with high affinity to Cys773 within the catalytic cleft of the ATP-binding pocket of the EGF receptor. It has been reported that this specific molecular interaction results in irreversible inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (R02-2292). Experimental data from in vitro washout studies confirmed the irreversible binding of BIBW 2992 to its molecular target. In constitutively EGFR-overexpressing A431 human epidermoid cancer cells, BIBW 2992 inhibition of EGFR-signaling lasted for up to 7 hours after removal of the compound from the cell cultures (U03-3218). In contrast, A431 cells exposed to reversible EGFR TKIs regained full receptor function almost immediately after inhibitor washout.  The specific activity of BIBW 2992 was determined in two independent in vitro assay systems: i) EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation using immunoprecipitation and Western blot and ii) clonogenic, anchorage-independent cell growth in a soft-agar assay system (P07- 02467). The antiproliferative effects observed with BIBW 2992 compare favourably to activity data published for gefitinib in the same NSCLC cell models (R06-1388). In addition, BIBW 2992 suppressed EGFR phosphorylation and clonogenic growth in the gefitinib- Final,  22 Jan 2010 BI Trial No.:  Trial Protocol Page       Boehringer Ingelheim1200.3419resistant NCI-H1975 model, suggesting that tumour cells harboring the T790M EGFR TKI \nresistance mutation remain sensitive to this irreversible EGFR small molecule inhibitor (R06-\n1391). \n \nThe in vivo activity of BIBW 2992 against EGFR was investigated in an A431 subcutaneous \nxenograft model (U03-3218). Daily oral treatment with BIBW 2992 at doses of 20 mg/kg \nresulted in an almost complete inhibition of tumour growth over a period of 25 days. Similar \nanti-tumour activity was observed in NCI-N87 tumour bearing mice treated with BIBW 2992 \nat similar concentrations. In these in vivo studies, BIBW 2992 plasma concentrations of 80- \n285 nM corresponding to an AUC0-24 of 589-3198 nM*h were required for anti-tumour \nactivity. All BIBW 2992 doses shown to be effective in mouse xenograft models were well \ntolerated. \n \nPharmacology and toxicology profile \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of BIBW 2992 after oral ingestion is 45% in rats with a median \ntmax reached after 4 hours and a terminal half-life (t1/2) of 4.5 hours. In rats the exposure was \ndose proportional and no gender-related effects or compound accumulation was observed. \nBIBW 2992 is primarily excreted via the faeces. No relevant inhibition of cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes was found. In vitro BIBW 2992 is however a CYP3A4 substrate (U05-1723-01). \nSince this is not considered a dominant metabolic pathway, in vitro drug-drug interactions \nwith CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors are not expected (U03-3218). In vivo BIBW 2992 was \nmetabolised only to a minor extent and the metabolism was governed by adduct formation to \nproteins or nucleophilic small molecules. It was found that metabolism is of subordinate role \nfor BIBW 2992 and that enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions play a negligible role for the \nmetabolism of BIBW 2992 in vivo. Only approx. 2 % of the dose were metabolised by FMO3 \nin vivo. The CYP3A4-dependent N-demethylation was even too low to be quantitatively \ndetected in human volunteers (U07-1737, U06-2055- 01, U07-1296-01). Therefore, intrinsic \n(e.g. genetic predisposition) or extrinsic (e.g. by comedications) effects on the activity of \nFMO3 or CYP3A4 in vivo are expected to be of little, if any, relevance for the \npharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992. The human ADME data confirmed the results of the \npreclinical [14C] ADME studies and all metabolites of the human  [14C] ADME study were \nobserved in the rat or the minipig (See U04-1028 and U06-1093, respectively). \n \nIn acute toxicology studies, oral administration of single doses in rats and mice indicated a \nlow acute toxic potential of BIBW 2992. Changes in renal and hepatic function occurred only \nat doses that were 10-30 fold above the levels required for antitumour activity. BIBW 2992 \nhad effects on gastrointestinal function that were dose-dependent and in high doses, leading \nto profound inhibition. No acute toxic effects on the central nervous system were detected. In \noral repeated dose studies for up to 26 weeks in rats and minipigs, the main target organs \nwere the gastrointestinal tract (rats and minipigs), kidneys (rat), and the skin (rats). In the \ngastrointestinal tract, increasing systemic exposure was associated with dose-dependent \natrophy of the epithelium and concomitant focal erosions/ulcerations in the stomach of rats \nand minipigs. In rat kidneys papillary necrosis and dilated tubules were found. Cutaneous \nalterations, i.e., epithelial atrophy were observed in rats. However, BIBW 2992 is not \nirritating to intact skin in albino rabbits and the effects observed in rats are most likely related \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n20\nto the specific pharmacodynamic mechanism of EGFR-inhibition (U03-3218). A variety of \norgans including the aerodigestive tract and reproductive organs were affected by epithelial \natrophy. These atrophic changes were not severe and fully reversed during a 2-week recovery \nperiod. Minor cardiovascular effects (increased blood pressure and heart rate) and a dose-\ndependent decrease of QT time in the electrocardiogram (ECG) occurred in BIBW 2992-\ntreated minipigs. These data do not indicate a risk for QT-prolongation related arrhythmia. \nBIBW 2992 had no pro-arrhythmic potential. BIBW 2992 demonstrated mutagenic potential \nin bacteria but had no genotoxic potential in vivo even at highly toxic/lethal doses in animals. \nBecause of its specific pharmacodynamic mechanism of action, BIBW 2992 is potentially \nembryo/ foetotoxic and/or teratogenic. \n \nBIBW 2992 Phase I and Phase II trial program \n \nThe most up to date trial and safety information can be found in the current version of the \nInvestigator Brochure (U03-3218). \n \nBIBW 2992 showed moderately fast absorption with median tmax values between 1 h to 6 h \nafter administration. The gMean terminal half-life (t1/2) of BIBW 2992 mainly ranged \nbetween 13 h to 57 h. In general, the maximum blood concentration (Cmax) and the integral of \nthe concentration time curve (AUC) of BIBW 2992 increased in a dose-proportional way \n(U03-3218). \n \nThe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIBW 2992 was identified as 50 mg once daily in \nphase I continuous dosing monotherapy trials. The 50mg dose is currently used in the phase \nIIb/III trial 1200.23 in NSCLC patients progressing on erlotinib or gefitinib, as maximum \nEGFR inhibition is required in this last-line population enriched for the presence of resistance \nmutations. For a more sensitive population with EGFR activating mutation, a starting dose of \n40mg is expected to be sufficient. In phase I clinical trials of BIBW 2992, durable responses \n(>20 months) were seen at daily doses of 40mg and less. \n \nIn this trial, a starting dose of 40 mg will be used in order to optimize the efficacy/toxicity \nbalance in the very sensitive population of first-line patients with EGFR activating mutations. \nVariability is expected in the incidence and severity of adverse events and to ensure \nmaximum EGFR inhibition, dose escalation to 50mg will be allowed after the first course of \ntreatment (21 days) in patients with minimal treatment-related adverse events. An interim \nanalysis based on response rate is planned to allow an early assessment of the efficacy of the \nstarting dose of 40mg (see Section 7.3.4). \n \nThe Adverse Events (AEs) observed to date in Phase I and Phase II trials are consistent with \nthose reported for other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dose dependent diarrhoea and skin \nrelated adverse events including rash and acne). Other AEs were in the expected range for \npatients with advanced cancer disease (U03-3218). In the BIBW 2992 Phase I monotherapy \ntrials, the most frequent drug-related adverse events were associated with gastrointestinal \ndisorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n(rash, dry skin, pruritus, acneiform rash, and acne), general disorders and administration site \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n21\nconditions (fatigue, mucosal inflammation), respiratory disorders (epistaxis, typically grade \n1), and metabolism and nutritional disorders (anorexia, dehydration). \n \nDiarrhoea is the single most often reported gastrointestinal AE. An increased incidence of \ndiarrhoea grade 3 (22.4%) has been observed in phase II monotherapy trials (starting dose of \n50 mg qd). Prompt and proactive management of diarrhoea together with timely treatment \npause and dose reduction is crucial to reduce the severity of diarrhoea and its potential \ncomplications such as dehydration leading to serum electrolyte changes (hyponatraemia, \nhypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia) and/or renal impairment.  \n \nNausea and vomiting are the other commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events and \ncan be generally managed successfully with the use of antiemetics.  \n \nSkin related adverse events present in a number of forms, i.e., rash (including erythematous, \nmaculo-papular, papular, etc.), acne, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, skin reaction and \npruritis. Folliculitis as well as nail changes (including paronychia) are other reported \nmanifestations of skin-related adverse events with BIBW 2992. Early and adequate \nmanagement of skin-related adverse events can reduce the frequency and the severity of them \n(R07-4077). \n \nFurther AEs included oral discomfort (stomatitis, mouth ulceration, oral pain, dry mouth) soft \ntissue disorder) and mucosal inflammation. Conjunctivitis and rhinorrhoea as a result of \ninflammation in the mucosal membranes have been reported. Mucosal and skin dryness can \nlead to epistaxis, which has always been observed at CTCAE Grade 1. Anorexia, fatigue and \nasthenia are also frequently observed. \n \nOf 22 evaluable patients with NSCLC from Phase I trials, there have been four partial \nresponses (PRs) (3 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PR) ranging in duration from 5 months to \n24 months. All 4 patients were non-smoking Caucasian with adenocarcinoma of the lung. In \ntwo of these three patients with confirmed PR, EGFR sequencing has shown Exon 19 inframe \ndeletions. These preliminary clinical efficacy data suggest that BIBW 2992 may be \nefficacious in patients with recurrent NSCLC harbouring sensitising EGFR mutations. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of BIBW 2992 in NSCLC is being evaluated in a phase II trial. In this \ntrial, patients with Stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation in exons 18-21 \nand failure of one line of systemic chemotherapy are treated with BIBW 2992 at a dose of \n50mg once daily until disease progression. Preliminary results of 67 patients  treated in the \n2nd line setting have shown tumour size reductions in the majority of patients with disease \ncontrol rate of 97%  and overall response rate of 66%. After amending and allowing first line \npatients into the trial preliminary data show an overall response rate of 63% and a disease \ncontrol rate of 97% of patients in a total of 38 first line patients  Diarrhoea (83.3%) and skin-\nrelated adverse events (87.4%) have been the main side effects but have been manageable \nwith appropriate dose interruption/reduction (P08-07355).  \n \nA global, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind phase IIB/III trial (LUX-Lung 1) is \ncurrently ongoing and is assessing the efficacy of BIBW 2992 plus best supportive care \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n22\n(BSC) when compared to placebo plus BSC in non-small cell lung cancer patients failing erlotinib or gefitinib.

                        "Content": " The introduction of the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib has changed the clinical management of patients with advanced NSCLC (R06-1394, R06-1307, R07-1049, R07-1134). For the first time, a significant clinical benefit may be achieved by a treatment that controls NSCLC progression with acceptable levels of side effects through a defined and specific, targeted molecular mechanism (R06-1394).  Patients with adenocarcinoma who have an EGFR mutation have a particularly significant benefit from treatment with TKIs (R08-5155). In these patients the objective response rates achieved with TKI therapy are superior to those obtained with chemotherapy. BIBW 2992 is a second generation irreversible EGFR-TKI (R07-1135, R07-1162) which may have improved potency when compared to erlotinib and gefitinib. BIBW 2992 may also prevent the emergence of the T790M resistance mutation which is commonly seen in patients relapsing after gefinitib or erlotinib. The preliminary results of a second-line study performed in EGFR mutation positive patients show a disease control rate of 87.5% with BIBW 2992 (P08-07355). These promising data support the conduct of a phase III trial with BIBW 2992 in patients with EGFR mutations.  In this trial eligible patients will be randomized (2:1) into two treatment arms to receive either (Arm A) BIBW 2992 or (Arm B) Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy.  In the comparator arm of this trial, bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy will not be included. Two recently reported randomized Phase III studies in the first line treatment of NSCLC, indicated that the addition of bevacizumab to standard paclitaxel and carboplatin (E4599) or gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy (B017704) increased the progression free survival from 4.8 to 6.4 months (R07-1161) and 6.1 to 6.7 months (R08-0542) respectively. But in the AVAIL trial no significant difference in overall survival was observed. Based on this data, and the restrictions on its use, bevacizumab is currently not widely used worldwide as standard first-line treatment for NSCLC and will not be included in the comparator arm of this trial.   Efficacy will be assessed by measuring progression-free survival according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (R09-0262), while safety will be analysed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 (R04-0474). In addition to evaluating treatment efficacy and safety, the study will also assess health-related quality of life and pharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992.

                        "Content": " The outcome for patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC is poor, with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 15%. In recent years tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to target the molecular pathways involved in tumour growth. There is now evidence that these agents are effective in NSCLC patients and particularly in the subgroup of patients whose tumours harbour mutations in the EGFR gene (R08-5155).  The currently available preclinical data indicate that BIBW 2992 is potentially superior to reversible EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib) (P08-06904). The preliminary clinical data from trial 1200.22 supports this (P08-07355). The results of first-line treatment with EGFR TKIs compare favourably with historical controls. However, only prospective and controlled clinical trials can establish these treatments as a new standard. The objective of this trial is to assess whether a targeted treatment for a targeted population can be identified, providing maximum benefit to the enriched population, whilst sparing those patients who are not likely to benefit.  Based on the toxicology findings and the experiences from the phase I and II studies, a continuous oral daily dose of 40mg BIBW 2992, together with proactive management of common side effects and the proposed dose reduction scheme, will be well tolerated. The most common side effects are expected to be primarily gastrointestinal (including diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and anorexia) as well as fatigue and rash. As an oral drug BIBW 2992 will be a much more convenient treatment for patients when compared to chemotherapy and the side effect profile is expected to be in favour of BIBW 2992. Although skin and gastrointestinal adverse events are common with BIBW 2992, they are rarely serious and almost always reversible, whereas chemotherapy is associated with potentially life-threatening side effects as a result of bone marrow suppression as well as potential irreversible side effects.  Regular and frequent assessment of clinical benefit (including early imaging with first radiological tumour assessment after 6 weeks of treatment) throughout Study 1200.34 will ensure that any patient not deriving clinical benefit will be withdrawn from the trial treatment. Furthermore an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will oversee the study and will advise on the further conduct of the trial based on the ongoing assessment of efficacy and safety data.  Considering the poor outcome in this group of patients and the need for the development of specific treatments with less side effects, it is expected that the benefits of first-line therapy with BIBW 2992 will outweigh the risks.

The primary endpoint of the trial will be progression free survival in all randomized patients.   The trial will be performed by investigators specialised in the treatment of lung cancer in Asia countries (China, India and Korea). It is estimated that approximately 1366 patients will be screened for the trial in order to find 330 eligible patients.   All patients will be required to provide a tumour biopsy sample at screening for EGFR mutation testing, which will be performed by a central laboratory.  Eligible patients will be randomized (2:1) to receive either single agent BIBW 2992 (Arm A) or chemotherapy with Gemcitabine/Cisplatin (Arm B).  In Arm A (BIBW 2992) 220 patients will receive continuous daily treatment with BIBW 2992 until progression, unacceptable adverse events or other reason necessitating withdrawal (see Section 6.3.1). The treatment will be administered as courses of 21 days. The starting dose of BIBW 2992 will be 40 mg once daily. In the event of no or minimal drug-related adverse events after one course of treatment, the dose will be increased to 50 mg (see Section 4.1.4.1 for details). As detailed in Section 4.1.4.1.1, dose reduction will occur in the event of certain drug-related adverse events. Dose reduction will be in increments of 10 mg, with the lowest dose being 20mg. Patients receiving 20 mg will be withdrawn from treatment if a drug-related grade 3 adverse event occurs. Regardless of the dose taken, a patient will be withdrawn from treatment if certain drug related events persist for more than 14 days despite stopping treatment (see Section 4.1.4.1.1), and then followed up as described in Section 6.1.4.  A limited pharmacokinetic sampling approach will be carried out for patients in arm A (BIBW 2992) - only trough PK samples will be taken (refer to Section 5.5).  In arm B (chemotherapy) 110 patients will receive Gemcitabine (1000 mg /m2) on day 1 and day 8, Cisplatin (75 mg /m2) on day 1 of each course. Patients will receive 6 courses of 3 weeks of treatment unless unacceptable side effects prevent this. All patients who receive at least one dose of treatment will be followed every 3 weeks after ending treatment until progression or other reason necessitating withdrawal (see Section 6.3.1). Dose reduction will occur in the event of certain adverse events (see Section 4.1.4.2).  Appendix 1 provides an overview of the trial design.

After week 48, assessment of response will be performed every 12 weeks until progression of withdrawal for another reason. Tumour response and progression will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262) and assessment at the investigator site will be sufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. An independent analysis of response will also be performed by a Central Imaging Unit (see Section 5.1.4) but this will not be used to make treatment decisions.  BIBW 2992, Gemcitabine and Cisplatin will be provided to the study sites by Boehringer Ingelheim and will be stored according to the specified conditions (see Section 4.1.7).

In the case of disagreement on the radiological assessment at any time-point between the two primary reviewers, a third adjudicating radiologist will select one of the primary reviewer\u2019s interpretations for all time-points. The data will also be reviewed by an oncologist who will provide a final assessment for each patient.  The review of the image data will be performed by independent radiologists, who are not affiliated with the study. All procedures will be done according to the specifications provided in the investigator site file. The purpose of the blinded reading is to independently assess patient response to therapy and disease progression.   Final,  22 Jan 2010 BI Trial No.:  Trial Protocol Page       Boehringer Ingelheim1200.3444Modifications of the conventional RECIST 1.1 lesion measurement criteria will be introduced into the measurement process in an attempt to reduce variability in the measurements for the independent central imaging review.  Eligibility and treatment decisions will be based on the assessment of disease by the investigator. Central imaging will not be used for this purpose and the results of the central imaging review will not be communicated to the investigator.  ",

Questionnaires should be completed by patients prior to seeing the clinician, prior to clinical assessment, prior to any treatment at the clinic, and before provision of any new information about their disease status so that the responses are not influenced (biased). The questionnaires generally take about 5-10 minutes to complete. Once completed, the questionnaires should be handed to the study co-ordinator or nurse. The data will then be transferred into the CRF by the sponsor. The questionnaires represent source documents (please refer to Section 8.2.4).  Validated translations exist for all questionnaires for all countries participating in the study and patients will receive the questionnaires in their native language.  Any unsolicited information provided by the patient on the questionnaire and any safety related data obtained from the patient\u2019s responses to the standard questions on the questionnaires will be immediately reported to the investigator. Adverse event information from the questionnaire will be appropriately reported in the CRF.  If local regulations require the completed questionnaires to be confidential (i.e. not seen by the site staff) appropriate arrangements will be made to ensure confidentiality.  The patient perspective is considered a supportive contribution to inform physicians on the clinical utility of BIBW 2992 compared to standard chemotherapy in the NSCLC population under investigation. In addition, the EQ-5D, HRQOL assessment will inform a later health economic (cost-effectiveness) analysis.  EQ-5D   Final,  22 Jan 2010 BI Trial No.:  Trial Protocol Page       Boehringer Ingelheim1200.3445The EQ-5D is a disease generic instrument that has been widely used and has been found to capture HRQOL changes in NSCLC (R07-2129, R07-2130). The EQ-5D comprises the following two questionnaires:  1. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension comprises three levels (no problems, some/moderate problems, extreme problems).  2. The EQ VAS records the respondents self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0- 100) visual analogue scale.  For the EQ-5D the respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by placing a cross in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. Additional instructions are provided in the ISF.  QLQ-C30 and LC-13  The QLQ-C30 is comprised of 30 questions. The QLQ-C30 incorporates both multi-items scales and single-item measures. These include one global health status/HRQOL scale, five functional scales, three symptoms scales and six single items to assess dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items- no item occurs in more than one scale (R07-2064). The QLQ-LC13 module comprises 13 questions. The module is designed for use in patients receiving treatment with chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy. The QLQ-LC13 incorporates one multi-item scale to assess dyspnoea, and a series of single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and haemoptysis (R07- 2064).

For ease of interpretation, a linear transformation will be used to standardise the raw scores of all items and scales, so that scores range from 0 to 100 (R07-2064). A higher score represents a higher (\u2018better\u2019) level of functioning (functional scales, global health status/QOL), or a higher (\u2018worse\u2019) level of symptoms (symptom scale/item) (R07-2064).

                        "Content": " The guidance below is taken from the summary of product characteristics (SPC). The guidance given in the latest published SPC should always take precedence over the guidance given below.  Supportive Care  Pre-medication should commence after a patient is randomised to receive chemotherapy. The recommended supportive care for Gemcitabine / Cisplatin chemotherapy is as follows;  \u2022 Pre-treatment hydration with 1 - 2 litres of fluid infused for 8 - 12 hours prior to Cisplatin will initiate diuresis. Adequate subsequent hydration should maintain diuresis during the 24 hours following administration. \u2022 Antiemetic treatment should follow the recommendations given in the Consensus Statement of the Antiemetic Subcommittee of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in cancer (MASCC): Prevention of chemotherapy- and radiotherapyinduced emesis: Results of the Perugia Consensus Conference (R06-0986).  Dose Modification Scheme  Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity may be required for gemcitabine and for cisplatin. Gemcitabine dosage adjustment for hematological toxicity is based on the granulocyte and platelet counts taken on the day of therapy. Patients receiving gemcitabine should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and platelet counts. If marrow suppression is detected, therapy should be modified or suspended according to the guidelines in Table 10.2:1.  In general, for severe (Grade 3 or 4) non-hematological toxicity, except alopecia and nausea/vomiting, therapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin should be held or decreased by 50% depending on the judgment of the treating physician. During combination therapy with cisplatin, serum creatinine, serum potassium, serum calcium, and serum magnesium should be carefully monitored (Grade 3/4 serum creatinine toxicity for gemcitabine plus cisplatin was 5% versus 2% for cisplatin alone).

                        "Content": "  The criteria below are based on RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262).  Measurability of the disease  Measurable lesions  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter \u2265 10 mm (by CT scan, MRI, caliper measurement) or \u2265 20 mm (by chest X-ray).  Measurable disease  Measurable disease requires the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.  Non-measurable disease  Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm with CT scan, MRI or caliper measurement or <20 mm with chest X-ray or pathological lymph nodes with shortest axis \u226510 and <15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly unmeasurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/ abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  New lesions in irradiated fields  Previously irradiated lesions should not be used as indicator lesions. However, new lesions occurring in previously irradiated fields can be used to assess the antitumour response.  Methods of measurement  All measurements must be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations must be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. If a lesion is considered too small to measure, a default measurement of 5mm should be applied. If the lesion is not visible, a default measurement of 0mm should be applied.  The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterise each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by colour photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is obligatory.  Final,  22 Jan 2010 BI Trial No.:  Trial Protocol Page       Boehringer Ingelheim1200.34102  CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to the chest, abdomen and pelvis.  Ultrasound, endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to measure tumour lesions or evaluate tumour response. However, these techniques can be useful to supplement information from other techniques.  Tumour markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalise for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, where known residual benign tumours can remain).  Baseline Documentation of Target and Non-target Lesions  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded, measured (longest diameter = LD) and numbered at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). Lymph nodes must be \u226515mm in order to be considered as target lesions.  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumour response of the measurable dimension of the disease (see Table 10.4:1).  ",

Progression (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  Although a clear progression of non-target lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail and the progression status should be confirmed later by the review panel (or study chair).  In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.  Confirmation  In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of six weeks.   Evaluation of Best Response to Study Treatment  The best response to study treatment (Table 10.4:3) is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression or start of further anti-cancer treatment (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient\u2019s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurements and confirmation criteria (Table 10.4:3).  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as \u201csymptomatic deterioration\u201d. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

The initial results of the study show that, although the median tmax and terminal half-life of BIBW 2992 were not affected, the rate and extent of absorption of BIBW 2992 was increased by co-treatment with ritonavir. These results also indicate that an effect of potent P-gp inducers on the PK characteristics of BIBW 2992 cannot be excluded. To ensure continued subject safety, the following amendment have been made in the protocol: 1. Change of exclusion criteria to clarify section listing restricted medications (Change 1) 2.

million new cases diagnosed and 880,000 deaths each year. The prognosis for \nadvanced Stage disease has not changed significantly in the past 20 years. With an overall 5- \nyear survival rate of only 15%, the treatment of this disease remains a major clinical \nchallenge (R05-0876). \n \nIn patients with advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIB pleural effusion or Stage IV metastatic \ndisease) systemic chemotherapy is considered the first line treatment of choice, prolonging \nthe median survival and palliating tumour-related symptoms (R05-0876). In an Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial, platinum-based doublets achieved an objective \nresponse in approximately 20% of advanced NSCLC patients and prolonged median survival \nto 7.9 months with a one-year survival rate of 33% and a two-year survival rate of 11% (R04-\n1314). Currently, several different platinum-based doublet combinations are in use worldwide \nas historically there has been no globally recognised superior regimen.  \n \nWhile systemic chemotherapy has demonstrated modest activity in advanced NSCLC, novel \ntargeted therapies based on specific molecular and biological characteristics of lung cancer \nhave emerged as a new treatment paradigm. The targets most extensively studied include the \nepidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) or the Subclass I of the superfamily of \ntransmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (R06-1302, R07-1049, R07-1135). The Epidermal \nGrowth Factor Receptor was the first member to be cloned and is the most biologically \nrelevant receptor for NSCLC. The erbB signaling system now comprises four closely related \ntyrosine kinase receptors: human epidermal growth factor receptor 1, HER 1 (erbB1/EGFR), \nHER2 (erbB2), HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4) (R06-1301, R06-1302). Growth factors, \nsuch as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), bind to \nEGFR and trigger the dimerisation of two EGFR molecules or the heterodimerisation with \nother closely related receptors, such as HER2. Autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation \nof the EGFR through its tyrosine kinase domain leads to the recruitment of downstream \neffector molecules and the activation of multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways. \nActivation of these signalling cascades is essential for controlling malignant cell growth and \nmetastasis (R06-1262, R06-1301, R06-1302). \n \nAberrant activation of EGFR is frequently observed in a variety of malignant tumours and \ncan be caused by different molecular mechanisms including mutations, receptor over-\nexpression, ligand-dependent receptor dimerisation, and ligand-independent activation. Over-\nexpression of EGFR is detected in 40% to 80% of NSCLC and this has led to the \ndevelopment of specific small molecule EGFR antagonists (R06-1301, R06-1393, R06- \n1394). First-generation EGFR small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) act as ATP \nanalogues, competing reversibly for the tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic site, and include \ngefitinib (Iressa\u00ae) and erlotinib (Tarceva\u00ae). \n \nDespite the high levels of EGFR over-expression in tumours in the majority of patients with \nNSCLC, recent clinical experiences with specific EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n16\ndemonstrated tumour regression in only 10% to 15% of unselected NSCLC patients (R05- \n0867, R06-1301, R06-1306). Further analysis has demonstrated that an objective tumour \nresponse to TKI therapy is more likely to occur in Asian females with adenocarcinomas \n(often with bronchoalveolar differentiation) and with a history of modest or no cigarette \nsmoking (R06-1259, R06-1306, R06-1395, R07-1049). \n \nFurther investigations in patients who respond to TKI therapy have indicated that the \nsensitivity to therapy may correlate with the presence of EGFR activating mutations. \nSequence analysis of tissue samples from NSCLC patients responsive to TKI therapy \nrevealed approximately 30 different somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of \nEGFR (R06-1262, R06-1393). The frequency of EGFR somatic mutations in the general \nNSCLC population was found to be approximately 10% in patients from the US, Europe or \nAustralia and up to 30% in patients from Japan and Taiwan (R06-1262, R06-1306, R06- \n1393). \n \nSpecific mutations sensitising EGFR to TKI therapy are either short, in-frame nucleotide \ndeletions, in-frame duplications/insertions or single-nucleotide substitutions clustered around \nthe region of the ATP binding-pocket of the receptor tyrosine kinase domain (R04-4507, \nR06-1311, R07-1134, R07-1135). The two most common mutations, accounting for more \nthan 90% of known sensitising EGFR mutations in NSCLC specimens result in an in-frame \ndeletion, including the amino acids at codons 746 to 750 (E746 to A750) in Exon 19 and a \npoint mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution at codon 858 (L858R) in Exon 21 \n(R04-4507, R06-1311, R06-1393, R07-1134, R07-1135). Structural analysis has revealed that \nthese mutations lead to a conformational change within the kinase domain, narrowing of the \nATP binding cleft and result in enhanced ligand-dependent receptor activation (R06-1264). In \naddition, these mutations result in stabilisation of both ATP and competitive small molecule \ninhibitors within the binding pocket. \n \nRetrospective analyses of studies have indicated that patients with activating Exon 19 and \nExon 21 EGFR mutations have a higher response rate and a prolonged survival following \ntreatment with single-agent TKIs compared to patients with wild-type EGFR (R06-1306, \nR06-1311, R06-1406, R08-4128). Several prospective phase II studies have investigated \nfurther the use of TKIs in patients harbouring EGFR mutations (R06-1310, R06-1458, R06- \n1459, R08-4048, R08-4078, R08-4049). The median PFS observed in these studies ranged \nfrom 8.9 months to 12 months, with response rates of between 55% and 90%. Overall \nsurvival of up to 24 months has been observed in patients with EGFR mutations receiving \ncustomised treatment (R08-4049). The largest cumulative series to date is a combined \nanalysis from seven trials of first-line gefitinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations \n(R08-4050). This analysis included 148 patients and demonstrated a PFS of 9.7 months and a \nresponse rate of 76.4%. \n \nThe IPASS trial is a phase III randomized trial of gefitinib versus carboplatin/paclitaxel \nchemotherapy as first-line treatment for Asian patients selected based on demographic \nfeatures associated with a higher frequency of mutations (adenocarcinoma, never or light \nexsmokers) (R08-4132). Recently presented data from this trial indicated that the median \nprogression-free survival (PFS) was equivalent in the two treatment arms (5.7 months with \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n17\ngefitinib versus 5.8 months with carboplatin/ paclitaxel) (R09-4437). A subgroup of the \noverall population was tested for EGFR mutation status and an analysis was performed on \nthis subgroup. Amongst the patients tested, the rate of mutation observed was 60%. Patients \nwho tested positive for EGFR mutation had a significantly higher response rate when treated \nwith gefitinib (71.2%) compared to treatment with carboplatin/ paclitaxel (47.3%). Patients \nwho tested negative for EGFR mutation had a significantly higher response rate when treated \nwith carboplatin/ paclitaxel (23.5%) compared to treatment with gefitinib (1.1%). Similarly \nwhen compared to chemotherapy, PFS was significantly longer in the presence of EGFR \nmutations (HR=0.48) and significantly shorter in the absence of EGFR mutations (HR=2.85) \nin the gefitinib arm. These results strongly suggest that the use of single agent TKIs for first-\nline therapy may only be of value in patients with EGFR mutations but that in this group of \npatients, treatment with single-agent TKIs may be more beneficial than chemotherapy. \n \nThe efficacy of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations depends on the type \nof mutation. Patients with one of the two most common mutations, Exon 19 deletions and \nL858R, have the highest response rates (84.2%) whereas patients with other, less common, \nmutations have lower response rates of less than 20% (R08-4109). \n \nIn trial 1200.34, patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR mutation will \nbe randomized to receive either Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy or the irreversible \nEGFR small molecule inhibitor BIBW 2992. \n \nBIBW 2992 is a member of the second generation of TKIs which bind irreversibly to EGFR \nand HER2 and are thought to have potential benefit over first generation TKIs such as \nerlotinib and gefitinib. One of the reasons for the potential benefit is that BIBW 2992 may \nhave activity against mutations which are resistant to the first generation TKIs (U03-3218). \nAdditionally the irreversible binding may confer more prolonged activity further delaying \ntumour progression when compared to reversible TKIs. \n \nDespite initially promising responses, most patients treated with currently available \nEGFRTKI therapies will eventually develop disease progression. Molecular analyses of \nrelapsed NSCLC samples from this group of patients have demonstrated an EGFR mutation \nrendering the tumour cells resistant to EGFR-TKI therapy (R06-1263, R06-1264, R06-1265, \nR06-1266, R06-1393). This specific mutation in Exon 20 causes a single base pair change \nleading to a threonine to methionine amino acid alteration in position 790 (T790M). This \nspecific threonine residue at position 790 serves as the \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 deep in the catalytic \nATP-binding site of the kinase domain. The bulkier methionine side chain confers drug \nresistance to the tumour cells by sterically hindering the access of TKIs such as erlotinib or \ngefitinib to the ATP binding site (R06-1264). \n \nStudies of tumour biopsies taken at diagnosis have shown that the T790M is rarely detected \nprior to treatment with EGFR TKIs (R06-1405). However, a recent study of EGFR mutations \nin circulating tumour cells detected the T790M mutation in 38% of patients prior to \ncommencing treatment (R08-4065). The authors also observed that the T790M mutation was \npresent at a relatively low frequency, suggesting that it is present in only a sub-clone of cells \nand may not be detected by conventional techniques. Following treatment with TKIs, the \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n18\nT790M mutation is detectable in approximately 50% of NSCLC with acquired resistance to \nerlotinib and gefitinib (R06-1264). \n \nOne of the proposed strategies to prevent or overcome the acquired resistance to TKI therapy \nin malignant tumours is the use of small molecule inhibitors with higher binding affinity, i.e., \nirreversible kinase inhibitors (R06-1263, R06-1389, R06-1390, R06-1391, R07-1135, R07- \n1162). Recently published experimental data strongly support this strategy (R06-1307). \nBronchioloalveolar NCI-H1650 NSCLC cells in vitro rapidly developed resistance to \ngefitinib but not to the irreversible EGFR inhibitors HKI-357, HKI-272, and EKB-569. \nMoreover, stable over-expression of T790M mutant EGFR conferred high-level biochemical \nresistance to the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib in Ba/F3 murine hematopoietic \nprogenitor cells that remain sensitive to the irreversible EGFR small molecule inhibitor CL-\n367,785 (R06-1390). BIBW 2992 also belongs to this class of irreversible kinase inhibitors \nand has recently shown in vitro activity against NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing the T790M \nmutation (P08-06904). BIBW 2992 also demonstrated activity in xenograft and transgenic \nlung cancer models expressing the T790M mutation. In the same experiment these xenografts \nwere resistant to lapatinib and gefitinib (P08-06904). \n \nThese preclinical data support the hypothesis that BIBW 2992 may be more efficacious in the \ntreatment of tumours harbouring EGFR mutations than the currently available TKIs. \n \n1.2 \nDRUG PROFILE \nBIBW 2992 is a highly selective and potent low molecular weight, irreversible inhibitor of \nthe erbB-family of tyrosine kinase receptors EGFR (erbB1 / HER1) and HER 2 (erbB2). All \nreferences in this protocol concerning BIBW 2992 refer to the oral formulation (U03-3218). \n \nThe potency of BIBW 2992 was determined in enzymatic assays using recombinant human \nwild-type EGFR (IC50 0.5 nM) and HER2 (IC50 14 nm) (U03-3218). A panel of \nrecombinant human kinases tested in parallel was not inhibited, demonstrating the high target \nspecificity of BIBW 2992 (U03-3218). Molecular modeling revealed that BIBW 2992 binds \ncovalently and with high affinity to Cys773 within the catalytic cleft of the ATP-binding \npocket of the EGF receptor. It has been reported that this specific molecular interaction \nresults in irreversible inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (R02-2292). \nExperimental data from in vitro washout studies confirmed the irreversible binding of BIBW \n2992 to its molecular target. In constitutively EGFR-overexpressing A431 human epidermoid \ncancer cells, BIBW 2992 inhibition of EGFR-signaling lasted for up to 7 hours after removal \nof the compound from the cell cultures (U03-3218). In contrast, A431 cells exposed to \nreversible EGFR TKIs regained full receptor function almost immediately after inhibitor \nwashout. \n \nThe specific activity of BIBW 2992 was determined in two independent in vitro assay \nsystems: i) EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation using immunoprecipitation and Western \nblot and ii) clonogenic, anchorage-independent cell growth in a soft-agar assay system (P07- \n02467). The antiproliferative effects observed with BIBW 2992 compare favourably to \nactivity data published for gefitinib in the same NSCLC cell models (R06-1388). In addition, \nBIBW 2992 suppressed EGFR phosphorylation and clonogenic growth in the gefitinib-\n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n19\nresistant NCI-H1975 model, suggesting that tumour cells harboring the T790M EGFR TKI \nresistance mutation remain sensitive to this irreversible EGFR small molecule inhibitor (R06-\n1391). \n \nThe in vivo activity of BIBW 2992 against EGFR was investigated in an A431 subcutaneous \nxenograft model (U03-3218). Daily oral treatment with BIBW 2992 at doses of 20 mg/kg \nresulted in an almost complete inhibition of tumour growth over a period of 25 days. Similar \nanti-tumour activity was observed in NCI-N87 tumour bearing mice treated with BIBW 2992 \nat similar concentrations. In these in vivo studies, BIBW 2992 plasma concentrations of 80- \n285 nM corresponding to an AUC0-24 of 589-3198 nM*h were required for anti-tumour \nactivity. All BIBW 2992 doses shown to be effective in mouse xenograft models were well \ntolerated. \n \nPharmacology and toxicology profile \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of BIBW 2992 after oral ingestion is 45% in rats with a median \ntmax reached after 4 hours and a terminal half-life (t1/2) of 4.5 hours. In rats the exposure was \ndose proportional and no gender-related effects or compound accumulation was observed. \nBIBW 2992 is primarily excreted via the faeces. No relevant inhibition of cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes was found. In vitro BIBW 2992 is however a CYP3A4 substrate (U05-1723-01). \nSince this is not considered a dominant metabolic pathway, in vitro drug-drug interactions \nwith CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors are not expected (U03-3218). In vivo BIBW 2992 was \nmetabolised only to a minor extent and the metabolism was governed by adduct formation to \nproteins or nucleophilic small molecules. It was found that metabolism is of subordinate role \nfor BIBW 2992 and that enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions play a negligible role for the \nmetabolism of BIBW 2992 in vivo. Only approx. 2 % of the dose were metabolised by FMO3 \nin vivo. The CYP3A4-dependent N-demethylation was even too low to be quantitatively \ndetected in human volunteers (U07-1737, U06-2055- 01, U07-1296-01). Therefore, intrinsic \n(e.g. genetic predisposition) or extrinsic (e.g. by comedications) effects on the activity of \nFMO3 or CYP3A4 in vivo are expected to be of little, if any, relevance for the \npharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992. The human ADME data confirmed the results of the \npreclinical [14C] ADME studies and all metabolites of the human  [14C] ADME study were \nobserved in the rat or the minipig (See U04-1028 and U06-1093, respectively). \n \nIn acute toxicology studies, oral administration of single doses in rats and mice indicated a \nlow acute toxic potential of BIBW 2992. Changes in renal and hepatic function occurred only \nat doses that were 10-30 fold above the levels required for antitumour activity. BIBW 2992 \nhad effects on gastrointestinal function that were dose-dependent and in high doses, leading \nto profound inhibition. No acute toxic effects on the central nervous system were detected. In \noral repeated dose studies for up to 26 weeks in rats and minipigs, the main target organs \nwere the gastrointestinal tract (rats and minipigs), kidneys (rat), and the skin (rats). In the \ngastrointestinal tract, increasing systemic exposure was associated with dose-dependent \natrophy of the epithelium and concomitant focal erosions/ulcerations in the stomach of rats \nand minipigs. In rat kidneys papillary necrosis and dilated tubules were found. Cutaneous \nalterations, i.e., epithelial atrophy were observed in rats. However, BIBW 2992 is not \nirritating to intact skin in albino rabbits and the effects observed in rats are most likely related \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n20\nto the specific pharmacodynamic mechanism of EGFR-inhibition (U03-3218). A variety of \norgans including the aerodigestive tract and reproductive organs were affected by epithelial \natrophy. These atrophic changes were not severe and fully reversed during a 2-week recovery \nperiod. Minor cardiovascular effects (increased blood pressure and heart rate) and a dose-\ndependent decrease of QT time in the electrocardiogram (ECG) occurred in BIBW 2992-\ntreated minipigs. These data do not indicate a risk for QT-prolongation related arrhythmia. \nBIBW 2992 had no pro-arrhythmic potential. BIBW 2992 demonstrated mutagenic potential \nin bacteria but had no genotoxic potential in vivo even at highly toxic/lethal doses in animals. \nBecause of its specific pharmacodynamic mechanism of action, BIBW 2992 is potentially \nembryo/ foetotoxic and/or teratogenic. \n \nBIBW 2992 Phase I and Phase II trial program \n \nThe most up to date trial and safety information can be found in the current version of the \nInvestigator Brochure (U03-3218). \n \nBIBW 2992 showed moderately fast absorption with median tmax values between 1 h to 6 h \nafter administration. The gMean terminal half-life (t1/2) of BIBW 2992 mainly ranged \nbetween 13 h to 57 h. In general, the maximum blood concentration (Cmax) and the integral of \nthe concentration time curve (AUC) of BIBW 2992 increased in a dose-proportional way \n(U03-3218). \n \nThe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIBW 2992 was identified as 50 mg once daily in \nphase I continuous dosing monotherapy trials. The 50mg dose is currently used in the phase \nIIb/III trial 1200.23 in NSCLC patients progressing on erlotinib or gefitinib, as maximum \nEGFR inhibition is required in this last-line population enriched for the presence of resistance \nmutations. For a more sensitive population with EGFR activating mutation, a starting dose of \n40mg is expected to be sufficient. In phase I clinical trials of BIBW 2992, durable responses \n(>20 months) were seen at daily doses of 40mg and less. \n \nIn this trial, a starting dose of 40 mg will be used in order to optimize the efficacy/toxicity \nbalance in the very sensitive population of first-line patients with EGFR activating mutations. \nVariability is expected in the incidence and severity of adverse events and to ensure \nmaximum EGFR inhibition, dose escalation to 50mg will be allowed after the first course of \ntreatment (21 days) in patients with minimal treatment-related adverse events. An interim \nanalysis based on response rate is planned to allow an early assessment of the efficacy of the \nstarting dose of 40mg (see Section 7.3.4). \n \nThe Adverse Events (AEs) observed to date in Phase I and Phase II trials are consistent with \nthose reported for other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dose dependent diarrhoea and skin \nrelated adverse events including rash and acne). Other AEs were in the expected range for \npatients with advanced cancer disease (U03-3218). In the BIBW 2992 Phase I monotherapy \ntrials, the most frequent drug-related adverse events were associated with gastrointestinal \ndisorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n(rash, dry skin, pruritus, acneiform rash, and acne), general disorders and administration site \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n21\nconditions (fatigue, mucosal inflammation), respiratory disorders (epistaxis, typically grade \n1), and metabolism and nutritional disorders (anorexia, dehydration). \n \nDiarrhoea is the single most often reported gastrointestinal AE. An increased incidence of \ndiarrhoea grade 3 (22.4%) has been observed in phase II monotherapy trials (starting dose of \n50 mg qd). Prompt and proactive management of diarrhoea together with timely treatment \npause and dose reduction is crucial to reduce the severity of diarrhoea and its potential \ncomplications such as dehydration leading to serum electrolyte changes (hyponatraemia, \nhypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia) and/or renal impairment.  \n \nNausea and vomiting are the other commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events and \ncan be generally managed successfully with the use of antiemetics.  \n \nSkin related adverse events present in a number of forms, i.e., rash (including erythematous, \nmaculo-papular, papular, etc.), acne, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, skin reaction and \npruritis. Folliculitis as well as nail changes (including paronychia) are other reported \nmanifestations of skin-related adverse events with BIBW 2992. Early and adequate \nmanagement of skin-related adverse events can reduce the frequency and the severity of them \n(R07-4077). \n \nFurther AEs included oral discomfort (stomatitis, mouth ulceration, oral pain, dry mouth) soft \ntissue disorder) and mucosal inflammation. Conjunctivitis and rhinorrhoea as a result of \ninflammation in the mucosal membranes have been reported. Mucosal and skin dryness can \nlead to epistaxis, which has always been observed at CTCAE Grade 1. Anorexia, fatigue and \nasthenia are also frequently observed. \n \nOf 22 evaluable patients with NSCLC from Phase I trials, there have been four partial \nresponses (PRs) (3 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PR) ranging in duration from 5 months to \n24 months. All 4 patients were non-smoking Caucasian with adenocarcinoma of the lung. In \ntwo of these three patients with confirmed PR, EGFR sequencing has shown Exon 19 inframe \ndeletions. These preliminary clinical efficacy data suggest that BIBW 2992 may be \nefficacious in patients with recurrent NSCLC harbouring sensitising EGFR mutations. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of BIBW 2992 in NSCLC is being evaluated in a phase II trial. In this \ntrial, patients with Stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation in exons 18-21 \nand failure of one line of systemic chemotherapy are treated with BIBW 2992 at a dose of \n50mg once daily until disease progression. Preliminary results of 67 patients  treated in the \n2nd line setting have shown tumour size reductions in the majority of patients with disease \ncontrol rate of 97%  and overall response rate of 66%. After amending and allowing first line \npatients into the trial preliminary data show an overall response rate of 63% and a disease \ncontrol rate of 97% of patients in a total of 38 first line patients  Diarrhoea (83.3%) and skin-\nrelated adverse events (87.4%) have been the main side effects but have been manageable \nwith appropriate dose interruption/reduction (P08-07355).  \n \nA global, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind phase IIB/III trial (LUX-Lung 1) is \ncurrently ongoing and is assessing the efficacy of BIBW 2992 plus best supportive care \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n22\n(BSC) when compared to placebo plus BSC in non-small cell lung cancer patients failing \nerlotinib or gefitinib. Based on the planned interim analysis of safety and efficacy described \nin the protocol, the independent DMC has allowed for continuation of recruitment in the trial. \n \n1.3 \nRATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL \nThe introduction of the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib has changed the clinical \nmanagement of patients with advanced NSCLC (R06-1394, R06-1307, R07-1049, R07-\n1134). For the first time, a significant clinical benefit may be achieved by a treatment that \ncontrols NSCLC progression with acceptable levels of side effects through a defined and \nspecific, targeted molecular mechanism (R06-1394). \n \nPatients with adenocarcinoma who have an EGFR mutation have a particularly significant \nbenefit from treatment with TKIs (R08-5155). In these patients the objective response rates \nachieved with TKI therapy are superior to those obtained with chemotherapy. BIBW 2992 is \na second generation irreversible EGFR-TKI (R07-1135, R07-1162) which may have \nimproved potency when compared to erlotinib and gefitinib. BIBW 2992 may also prevent \nthe emergence of the T790M resistance mutation which is commonly seen in patients \nrelapsing after gefinitib or erlotinib. The preliminary results of a second-line study performed \nin EGFR mutation positive patients show a disease control rate of 87.5% with BIBW 2992 \n(P08-07355). These promising data support the conduct of a phase III trial with BIBW 2992 \nin patients with EGFR mutations. \n \nIn this trial eligible patients will be randomized (2:1) into two treatment arms to receive \neither (Arm A) BIBW 2992 or (Arm B) Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy. \n \nIn the comparator arm of this trial, bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy will not be \nincluded. Two recently reported randomized Phase III studies in the first line treatment of \nNSCLC, indicated that the addition of bevacizumab to standard paclitaxel and carboplatin \n(E4599) or gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy (B017704) increased the progression free \nsurvival from 4.8 to 6.4 months (R07-1161) and 6.1 to 6.7 months (R08-0542) respectively. \nBut in the AVAIL trial no significant difference in overall survival was observed. Based on \nthis data, and the restrictions on its use, bevacizumab is currently not widely used worldwide \nas standard first-line treatment for NSCLC and will not be included in the comparator arm of \nthis trial.  \n \nEfficacy will be assessed by measuring progression-free survival according to RECIST 1.1 \ncriteria (R09-0262), while safety will be analysed using the Common Terminology Criteria \nfor Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 (R04-0474). In addition to evaluating treatment \nefficacy and safety, the study will also assess health-related quality of life and \npharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n23\n1.4 \nBENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT \nThe outcome for patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC is poor, with an overall 5-year \nsurvival rate of only 15%. In recent years tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to \ntarget the molecular pathways involved in tumour growth. There is now evidence that these \nagents are effective in NSCLC patients and particularly in the subgroup of patients whose \ntumours harbour mutations in the EGFR gene (R08-5155). \n \nThe currently available preclinical data indicate that BIBW 2992 is potentially superior to \nreversible EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib) (P08-06904). The preliminary clinical data from \ntrial 1200.22 supports this (P08-07355). The results of first-line treatment with EGFR TKIs \ncompare favourably with historical controls. However, only prospective and controlled \nclinical trials can establish these treatments as a new standard. The objective of this trial is to \nassess whether a targeted treatment for a targeted population can be identified, providing \nmaximum benefit to the enriched population, whilst sparing those patients who are not likely \nto benefit. \n \nBased on the toxicology findings and the experiences from the phase I and II studies, a \ncontinuous oral daily dose of 40mg BIBW 2992, together with proactive management of \ncommon side effects and the proposed dose reduction scheme, will be well tolerated. The \nmost common side effects are expected to be primarily gastrointestinal (including diarrhoea, \nnausea, vomiting and anorexia) as well as fatigue and rash. As an oral drug BIBW 2992 will \nbe a much more convenient treatment for patients when compared to chemotherapy and the \nside effect profile is expected to be in favour of BIBW 2992. Although skin and \ngastrointestinal adverse events are common with BIBW 2992, they are rarely serious and \nalmost always reversible, whereas chemotherapy is associated with potentially life-\nthreatening side effects as a result of bone marrow suppression as well as potential \nirreversible side effects. \n \nRegular and frequent assessment of clinical benefit (including early imaging with first \nradiological tumour assessment after 6 weeks of treatment) throughout Study 1200.34 will \nensure that any patient not deriving clinical benefit will be withdrawn from the trial \ntreatment. Furthermore an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will oversee the study \nand will advise on the further conduct of the trial based on the ongoing assessment of efficacy \nand safety data. \n \nConsidering the poor outcome in this group of patients and the need for the development of \nspecific treatments with less side effects, it is expected that the benefits of first-line therapy \nwith BIBW 2992 will outweigh the risks. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n24\n2. \nTRIAL OBJECTIVES \n2.1 \nGENERAL AIM - OBJECTIVES \nThis randomized, open label phase III trial will be performed in patients with \nadenocarcinoma of the lung with tumours harbouring an EGFR activating mutation.

The primary endpoint of the trial will be \nprogression free survival in all randomized patients.  \n \nThe trial will be performed by investigators specialised in the treatment of lung cancer in \nAsia countries (China, India and Korea). It is estimated that approximately 1366 patients will \nbe screened for the trial in order to find 330 eligible patients.  \n \nAll patients will be required to provide a tumour biopsy sample at screening for EGFR \nmutation testing, which will be performed by a central laboratory. \n \nEligible patients will be randomized (2:1) to receive either single agent BIBW 2992 (Arm A) \nor chemotherapy with Gemcitabine/Cisplatin (Arm B). \n \nIn Arm A (BIBW 2992) 220 patients will receive continuous daily treatment with BIBW \n2992 until progression, unacceptable adverse events or other reason necessitating withdrawal \n(see Section 6.3.1). The treatment will be administered as courses of 21 days. The starting \ndose of BIBW 2992 will be 40 mg once daily. In the event of no or minimal drug-related \nadverse events after one course of treatment, the dose will be increased to 50 mg (see Section \n4.1.4.1 for details). As detailed in Section 4.1.4.1.1, dose reduction will occur in the event of \ncertain drug-related adverse events. Dose reduction will be in increments of 10 mg, with the \nlowest dose being 20mg. Patients receiving 20 mg will be withdrawn from treatment if a \ndrug-related grade 3 adverse event occurs. Regardless of the dose taken, a patient will be \nwithdrawn from treatment if certain drug related events persist for more than 14 days despite \nstopping treatment (see Section 4.1.4.1.1), and then followed up as described in Section 6.1.4. \n \nA limited pharmacokinetic sampling approach will be carried out for patients in arm A \n(BIBW 2992) - only trough PK samples will be taken (refer to Section 5.5). \n \nIn arm B (chemotherapy) 110 patients will receive Gemcitabine (1000 mg /m2) on day 1 and \nday 8, Cisplatin (75 mg /m2) on day 1 of each course. Patients will receive 6 courses of 3 \nweeks of treatment unless unacceptable side effects prevent this. All patients who receive at \nleast one dose of treatment will be followed every 3 weeks after ending treatment until \nprogression or other reason necessitating withdrawal (see Section 6.3.1). Dose reduction will \noccur in the event of certain adverse events (see Section 4.1.4.2). \n \nAppendix 1 provides an overview of the trial design. \n \nAll patients will visit the investigator at regular intervals for assessment of safety parameters \nand adverse events as outlined in the flow chart. Assessments of response will be made at 6 \nweeks, 12 weeks and every 6 weeks thereafter until progression or withdrawal for another \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n26\nreason. After week 48, assessment of response will be performed every 12 weeks until \nprogression of withdrawal for another reason. Tumour response and progression will be \nassessed using RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262) and assessment at the investigator site will be \nsufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. An independent analysis of response \nwill also be performed by a Central Imaging Unit (see Section 5.1.4) but this will not be used \nto make treatment decisions. \n \nBIBW 2992, Gemcitabine and Cisplatin will be provided to the study sites by Boehringer \nIngelheim and will be stored according to the specified conditions (see Section 4.1.7). \n \nAll trial relevant documentation will be stored in the clinical trial master file (CTMF) at \nBoehringer Ingelheim. In addition each site will have an Investigator Site File (ISF) \ncontaining all trial documents relevant for the site. \n \nThe coordinating investigators are investigators participating in the trial who have experience \nof this type of trial and investigations. The coordinating investigators have been designated \nby Boehringer Ingelheim and will sign the clinical trial report. \n \n3.2 \nDISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF \nCONTROL GROUP(S) \nThe primary objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy of BIBW 2992 to chemotherapy \nin patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR activating mutation. \nPatients will be randomized to receive either BIBW 2992 or chemotherapy with \nGemcitabine/Cisplatin. Due to the inherent differences between the two treatment arms, the \ntrial will be open-label. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival and therefore the patients will \nbe followed until progression. \n \n3.3 \nSELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION \nA log of all patients who have signed the informed consent form will be maintained in the \nISF at the investigational site. The trial will be conducted in multiple centres in Asia (China, \nIndia and Korea). It is estimated that approximately 1366 patients will be screened in order to \nrecruit 330 eligible patients. \n \nAdditional centres may be opened in the event of slower than expected recruitment and \nunderperforming centres may be closed. Recruitment rates will vary between centres but it is \nexpected that 36 patients per month will be randomized into the trial over a period of 9-10 \nmonths recruitment. \n3.3.1 \nInclusion criteria \nPatients are eligible for inclusion (enrolment) if they fulfill the following criteria: \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n27\n1.

The access to the randomization code will be \nsupervised by the Clinical Trial Support Group and persons directly involved in the conduct \nand analysis of the trial will have no access to the randomization schedule. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n31\n4.1.3 \nSelection of doses in the trial \nArm A:  \nThe starting dose for BIBW 2992 continuous dosing is 40 mg. \n \nArm B:  \nStandard chemotherapy with;  \nGemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 followed by Cisplatin 75 mg/ m2  \n \nThese doses have been chosen according to the published information for these drugs. \n \n4.1.4 \nSelection and timing of doses for each patient \n4.1.4.1 BIBW 2992 (Arm A) \nFor administrative purposes treatment will be divided into treatment courses, which are each \n3 weeks (21 days) in duration. Patients will take a single oral dose of 40mg BIBW 2992 each \nday for the first course (21 days). \n \nIf the patient experiences \u2265 Grade 1 diarrhoea, skin-related adverse events or mucositis or \nany drug-related event \u2265 Grade 2 during the first course, the dose of BIBW 2992 should be \ncontinued at 40mg (unless dose reduction is necessary - see Section 4.1.4.1.1). \n \nIf none of the above events are experienced during the first course of treatment, the dose for \nCourse 2 should be increased to 50 mg. The patient should remain on 50 mg for subsequent \ntreatment courses, unless dose reduction is necessary (see Section 4.1.4.1.1). Any exceptions \nto this will be decided by the Boehringer Ingelheim clinical monitor in agreement with the \ninvestigator. \n  \nDose escalation is prohibited in any situation other than that described above. \n \nThe medication should be taken at the same time each day (\u00b1 2 hours) at least one hour \nbefore food intake and at least three hours after food intake. The tablet should be swallowed \nwith a glass of water. BIBW 2992 tablets are film-coated and therefore should not be chewed \nor crushed, but may be administered via G-tube after dispersing the BIBW 2992 tablets \naccording to the following procedure: Place the tablet into a glass containing 50 mL isotonic \nsodium chloride solution. Stir until the tablet is broken up into very fine particles (about 15 \nminutes). Drink the suspension immediately or administer via a gastric tube. Rinse the glass \nwith another 50 ml of isotonic sodium chloride solution and drink or administer the \nsupplementary solution via the gastric-tube again (to pick up any drug remaining in the \nglass/gastric-tube). \n \nPharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on Day 1 and Day 8 of Course 2 and on Day 1 \nof Course 3. On these days patients should not take the trial medication and should not eat for \nat least three hours prior to their visit to the study site. If a patient needs to eat within 3 hours \nof a scheduled visit, tablets should be taken as usual and the time of food intake noted on the \nCRF. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n32\n4.1.4.1.1 \nDose reduction scheme for BIBW 2992 \n \nIn the event of treatment-related toxicities, the treatment with BIBW 2992 should be handled \naccording to the schedule in Table 4.1.4.1.1:1 \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n33\nTable 4.1.4.1.1:1 Dose reduction scheme \n \nAE type and grade \nAction Dose \nDose reduction \nscheme\nEvents related to study drug; \n\u2022 Any drug related AE CTCAE \nGrade \u22653. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade \u22652 diarrhoea \npersisting for 2 or more \nconsecutive days (48 hours) \ndespite adequate anti-diarrhoeal \nmedication/ hydration. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade \u22652 nausea and/or \nvomiting persisting for 7 or more \nconsecutive days despite \nantiemetic treatment/ hydration. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade \u22652 worsening of \nrenal function as measured by \nserum creatinine, newly developed \nproteinuria, or newly developed \ndecrease in glomerular filtration \nrate of more than 50% from \nbaseline. \nPause treatment with BIBW \n2992 until patient has \nrecovered to CTCAE Grade \u2264 \n1 or baseline1. \n \nResume treatment at reduced \ndose according to schedule \nopposite.

A compliance check should be performed on day 8 \nof course 1 to ensure that the medication is being taken correctly. Subsequently, at the end of \neach course of treatment the patient should bring all remaining medication to the site and a \ncompliance check should be performed. Discrepancies between the number of tablets \nremaining and the calculated number of tablets that the patient should have taken should be \ndocumented and explained. At the end of each course any remaining medication should be \ncollected. If the patient is eligible for a further course of treatment a new bottle should be \ndispensed. \n \nPatients experiencing emesis should not take a replacement dose. BIBW 2992 should not be \ntaken more than once a day under any circumstances. \n \n4.3.2 \nGemcitabine/Cisplatin Chemotherapy (Arm B) \nChemotherapy will be administered at the trial site under the supervision of the investigator. \n \nIn the event that the patient does not receive the full dose of chemotherapy this should be \ndocumented and a reason given. \n. \n4.4 \nMANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS \n4.4.1 Management of diarrhoea following treatment with BIBW 2992 (Arm A) \nClose monitoring and proactive management of diarrhoea is essential for successful treatment \nof patients with BIBW 2992. Early and appropriate intervention can prevent the development \nof more severe diarrhoea. In most cases, loperamide controls diarrhoea caused by BIBW \n2992. Loperamide should be available at the start of therapy and kept with the patient at all \ntimes; it is therefore advisable that patients be given a prescription at the time of initiating \ntreatment with BIBW 2992. \n \nThe recommendations for management are as follows: \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n39\n\u2022 \nIf any diarrhoea is experienced (CTCAE Grade 1), two 2 mg loperamide tablets \nshould be taken immediately, followed by one 2 mg tablet with every loose bowel \nmovement, up to a maximum daily dose of 10 tablets (20 mg). \n\u2022 \nIn the event of diarrhoea patients should be advised to avoid lactose-containing \nproducts or any foods known to aggravate diarrhoea. \n\u2022 \nOral hydration is essential regardless of severity; appropriate rehydration (1.5 \nl/m2/day plus equivalent of actual fluid loss) and electrolyte replacement has to be \nensured in the event of CTCAE Grade 2 and Grade 3 adverse events. \n\u2022 \nFor CTCAE Grade 3 diarrhoea or CTCAE Grade 2 diarrhoea lasting \u2265 2 days (48 \nhours) despite adequate antidiarrhoeal treatment, BIBW 2992 must be paused until \nrecovery to CTCAE \u2264 Grade 1. Upon recovery, BIBW 2992 should be resumed at a \nreduced dose according to the dose reduction scheme outlined in Section 4.1.4.1.1. \n \nThe occurrence of diarrhoea and the outcome of treatment will be recorded in the AE section \nof the CRF. Antidiarrhoeal treatments should be documented in the concomitant medication \nsection of the CRF. \n \nIf despite optimal supportive care and a treatment pause, diarrhoea does not resolve to CTC \nGrade \u22641 within 14 days, the patient must not receive any further BIBW 2992 treatment and \nthe end of treatment (EOT) visit should be performed. \n \n4.4.2 Management of nausea and vomiting following treatment with BIBW 2992 (Arm \nA) \nNausea and vomiting may significantly affect patients\u2019 adherence to the treatment and their \nquality of life. In order to reduce the occurrence and the intensity of emesis, the patients \nshould be treated according to the recommendation given in Table 4.4.2:1. \n \nTable 4.4.2:1 Management of nausea and vomiting \nCTCAE Grade \nAntiemetic treatment \nNausea = grade 0 \nand \nVomiting = grade 0  \nNo antiemetic prophylactic treatment \nNausea = grade 1 \nand \nVomiting = grade 0 \nNo antiemetic treatment \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n40\nNausea = grade 2 \nand \nVomiting = grade 0 \n \nNausea = grade 0, 1 or 2 \nand \nVomiting = grade 1 or 2 \nAntiemetic treatment1\n \nPause BIBW 2992 treatment if grade 2 vomiting or \ngrade 2 nausea persist for 7 or more consecutive \ndays despite optimal supportive care. Resume \ntreatment when CTCAE grade \u2264 1. \nVomiting \u2265 grade 3 \nor  \nNausea \u2265 grade 3 \nAntiemetic treatment1 \n \nPause BIBW 2992 treatment until return to CTCAE \ngrade \u2264 1 or baseline2. \n \n1  Antiemetic treatment should follow the recommendations given in the Consensus Statement of the Antiemetic \nSubcommittee of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in cancer (MASCC): Prevention of chemotherapy- \nand radiotherapy-induced emesis: Results of the Perugia Consensus Conference (R06-0986). \n2  Baseline is defined as the CTCAE grade at the start of treatment. \n \nAfter a treatment pause the dose of BIBW 2992 should be reduced according to the dose \nreduction scheme in Table 4.1.4.1.1:1. \n \nThe occurrence of nausea and/or vomiting and the outcome of treatment will be recorded in \nthe AE section of the CRF. Antiemetic treatments should be documented in the concomitant \nmedication section of the CRF with the start and end of treatment dates and daily dose. \n \nIn case of nausea and/or vomiting \u2265 CTCAE grade 2, appropriate hydration (1.5 L/m2/day \nplus hydration deficit) must be ensured. \n \n4.4.3 Management of rash following treatment with BIBW 2992 (Arm A) \nA proactive and early approach to management of rash is crucial. Rash can be managed by a \nvariety of treatment options to relieve symptoms and reduce the rash. \n \nThe recommendations for management are as follows: \n\u2022 General/Prevention: strict sun protection; use of a sunscreen of Sun Protection Factor \n15 (SPF 15) or higher, preferably containing zinc oxide; use of a thick, alcohol-free \nemollient cream; avoid harsh detergents, avoid using a solarium. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade 1 rash: mild rash may not need treatment. However, if treatment is \nconsidered necessary, topical hydrocortisone (1% or 2.5%) cream and/or clindamycin \n1% gel can be used. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade 2 rash: relief from major symptoms caused by CTCAE Grade 2 skin-\nrelated adverse events should be achieved by a combination of local and systemic \ntherapies including: \n1) Systemic antibiotics (doxycycline or minocycline etc.). \n2) Topical treatment (hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, clindamycin 1% gel, pimecrolimus \n1% cream). \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n41\nAnd / or \n1) Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, etc.) \n2) Oral prednisone (short term i.e., <14 days treatment) may be added at investigator\u2019s \ndiscretion. \nSystemic and topical treatment should be initiated at the start of CTCAE Grade 2 rash \nand continue until improvement or resolution to CTCAE Grade \u22641. If grade 2 rash \npersists for \u2265 7 days despite treatment and is poorly tolerated by the patient, the \ninvestigator may choose to pause treatment for up to 14 days followed by a reduction in \nthe dose of BIBW 2992 according to the dose reduction scheme in Table 4.1.4.1.1:1. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade 3 (or greater) rash: may be treated in a manner similar to CTCAE \nGrade 2 rash. In the event of CTCAE Grade \u22653 rash, treatment with BIBW 2992 should \nbe paused until recovery to CTCAE Grade \u22641. Treatment should be resumed at a reduced \ndose (see Section 4.1.4.1). If CTCAE Grade \u22653 rash does not resolve to CTCAE Grade \n\u22641 within 14 days of stopping BIBW 2992 treatment and despite optimal supportive care, \nthe patient should not receive any further treatment with BIBW 2992 and the End of \nTreatment visit should be performed. \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n42\n5. \nOBSERVATIONS \n5.1 \nEFFICACY - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR PHARMACODYNAMICS \n5.1.1 Primary Endpoint \nThe primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) in all randomized patients, defined as \ntime from the date of randomization to the date of progression or to the date of death, \nwhichever occurs first. \n \n5.1.2 Secondary Endpoints \nSecondary endpoints are; \n\u2022 Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease \n(PD) according to RECIST 1.1  (R09-0262) \n\u2022 Overall survival (OS) defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the \ndate of death. \n\u2022 Time to deterioration of body weight (defined as the first occurrence of a decrease from \nbaseline of more than 10 %) and time to deterioration of ECOG performance status.  \n\u2022 Health-related quality of life (HRQOL). \n\u2022 Pharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992 (see Section 5.5) \n\u2022 Safety of BIBW 2992 as indicated by intensity and incidence of adverse events, graded \naccording to US NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 (R04-0474). \n \n5.1.3 Tumour Assessment \nResponse will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262). Complete Response (CR), \nPartial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive Disease (PD) will be assessed by \nthe investigator and also by a central imaging unit (see Section 5.1.4). \n \nEvery effort should be made to objectively evaluate tumour response and confirm tumour \nprogression with radiological tumour imaging for all patients who enter into the trial, \nincluding those who discontinue prematurely. \n \nOne to five target lesions (not exceeding two lesions per organ) should be identified at \nscreening by Computed Tomography (CT). Skin lesions should be measured and \nphotographic documentation should be performed. Individual lesions detected at screening \nwill be numbered and recorded in the CRF. These lesions should be followed up with the \nsame method(s) used at screening and the same numbering should be applied. The size of the \ntarget lesions will be recorded in millimetres. The examinations should be performed at \nscreening, after 6 weeks, after 12 weeks and every 6 weeks thereafter. After week 48, \nassessments should be performed every 12 weeks. If a patient develops an allergy to contrast \nmedia, MRI scans can be substituted for CT scans. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n43\nTumour assessment does not need to be performed at the screening visit if there are valid \nresults available from assessments which were performed as part of routine clinical practice \nwithin the allowed time window (within 28 days prior to start of treatment). \n \nTarget lesions should be selected based on their size (those with the longest diameter) and \nsuitability for accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions should be identified as non-\ntarget lesions and will be recorded at baseline. The non-target lesions will be followed during \nthe patients\u2019 participation and will be taken into consideration when determining the patients\u2019 \nresponse. \n \nFull details of RECIST 1.1 assessment can be found in Appendix 4. \n \nA bone scan should be performed at baseline in cases of clinical suspicion of previously \nunknown bone metastasis (e.g. bone or joint pain associated with relevant increases of \ncalcium and alkaline phosphatase). If the patient has known bone metastases or if bone \nmetastases are detected at screening, correlative imaging (X-ray or CT scan) should be done \nof the respective lesion(s) at baseline and subsequently correlative imaging of known bone \nlesions should be performed at every imaging time-point. During study treatment, bone scans \nshould be performed when medically indicated e.g. in case of suspected new bone metastases. \n \nIn the event of a delay, interruption or discontinuation of treatment, tumour assessment \nshould continue to follow the original schedule. The schedule should be followed until \nprogression is observed or until the patient commences further treatment for disease, \nwhichever occurs first. \n \n5.1.4 Central imaging \nAll image data will be sent to a central imaging unit to obtain an independent blinded \nconfirmation of tumour response assessment based on a uniform interpretation of \nradiographic image data for all patients enrolled in the trial. Upon receipt, the central imaging \nunit will log all image data into a tracking system and perform quality control of digitised \nradiographic images. An independent review of radiographic images including (i) sequential \nlesion selection and measurement and (ii) incremental radiological response assessment \nfollowed by (iii) global review of tumour response or progression will be performed by two \nblinded (with regard to patient, treatment, and visit) radiologists. In the case of disagreement \non the radiological assessment at any time-point between the two primary reviewers, a third \nadjudicating radiologist will select one of the primary reviewer\u2019s interpretations for all time-\npoints. The data will also be reviewed by an oncologist who will provide a final assessment \nfor each patient. \n \nThe review of the image data will be performed by independent radiologists, who are not \naffiliated with the study. All procedures will be done according to the specifications provided \nin the investigator site file. The purpose of the blinded reading is to independently assess \npatient response to therapy and disease progression. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n44\nModifications of the conventional RECIST 1.1 lesion measurement criteria will be introduced \ninto the measurement process in an attempt to reduce variability in the measurements for the \nindependent central imaging review. \n \nEligibility and treatment decisions will be based on the assessment of disease by the \ninvestigator. Central imaging will not be used for this purpose and the results of the central \nimaging review will not be communicated to the investigator. \n \n5.1.5 Health-Related Quality Of Life \nHealth-Related Quality Of life (HRQOL) will be measured with the following \nmultidimensional questionnaires included in Appendix 3. \n \n\u2022 \nEQ-5D health status self-assessment questionnaire (R96-2382) \n \n\u2022 EORTC QLQ-C30, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer \n(EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) (R99-1213, R07-2064) \n \n\u2022 EORTC Lung cancer specific supplementary module (EORTC QLQ-LC13) (R07-2060, \nR07-2065) \n \nAll three questionnaires will be completed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart. \nQuestionnaires should be completed by patients prior to seeing the clinician, prior to clinical \nassessment, prior to any treatment at the clinic, and before provision of any new information \nabout their disease status so that the responses are not influenced (biased). The questionnaires \ngenerally take about 5-10 minutes to complete. Once completed, the questionnaires should be \nhanded to the study co-ordinator or nurse. The data will then be transferred into the CRF by \nthe sponsor. The questionnaires represent source documents (please refer to Section 8.2.4).  \nValidated translations exist for all questionnaires for all countries participating in the study \nand patients will receive the questionnaires in their native language. \n \nAny unsolicited information provided by the patient on the questionnaire and any safety \nrelated data obtained from the patient\u2019s responses to the standard questions on the \nquestionnaires will be immediately reported to the investigator. Adverse event information \nfrom the questionnaire will be appropriately reported in the CRF. \n \nIf local regulations require the completed questionnaires to be confidential (i.e. not seen by \nthe site staff) appropriate arrangements will be made to ensure confidentiality. \n \nThe patient perspective is considered a supportive contribution to inform physicians on the \nclinical utility of BIBW 2992 compared to standard chemotherapy in the NSCLC population \nunder investigation. In addition, the EQ-5D, HRQOL assessment will inform a later health \neconomic (cost-effectiveness) analysis. \n \nEQ-5D \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n45\nThe EQ-5D is a disease generic instrument that has been widely used and has been found to \ncapture HRQOL changes in NSCLC (R07-2129, R07-2130). The EQ-5D comprises the \nfollowing two questionnaires: \n \n1. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, \npain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension comprises three levels (no \nproblems, some/moderate problems, extreme problems). \n \n2. The EQ VAS records the respondents self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0- \n100) visual analogue scale. \n \nFor the EQ-5D the respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by placing a cross in \nthe box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. Additional \ninstructions are provided in the ISF. \n \nQLQ-C30 and LC-13 \n \nThe QLQ-C30 is comprised of 30 questions. The QLQ-C30 incorporates both multi-items \nscales and single-item measures. These include one global health status/HRQOL scale, five \nfunctional scales, three symptoms scales and six single items to assess dyspnea, insomnia, \nappetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties. Each of the multi-item scales \nincludes a different set of items- no item occurs in more than one scale (R07-2064). The \nQLQ-LC13 module comprises 13 questions. The module is designed for use in patients \nreceiving treatment with chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy. The QLQ-LC13 incorporates \none multi-item scale to assess dyspnoea, and a series of single items assessing pain, \ncoughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and haemoptysis (R07- \n2064). \n \n5.2 \nSAFETY \n5.2.1 Adverse Events \nDuring the screening phase of the trial, the patient\u2019s condition will be assessed (e.g., \ndocumentation of history / concomitant diagnoses and diseases), and subsequently all \nrelevant changes from baseline will be noted. \n \nThe definition of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) can be found in \nSection 8.4.1. A list of expected adverse events with BIBW 2992 can be found in the \ninvestigator brochure (U03-3218). \n \nPatients will be required to report spontaneously any adverse events (AEs) as well as the \ndates of onset and end of these events. Specific questions will be asked wherever required or \nuseful to more precisely describe an AE and to allow a grading according to CTCAE, Version \n3 (R04-0474). \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n46\nA carefully written record of all AEs shall be kept by the investigator in charge of the trial. \nRecords of AEs shall include data on the date of onset, end date and CTCAE grading of the \nevent as well as any treatment or action required for the event and its outcome. \n \nRegular and continuing assessment of safety will be performed at least once per course \nduring the first 6 courses and every 3 weeks thereafter. Dose reduction schemes are provided \nin Section 4.1.4.1.1 and Section 4.1.4.2 for patients who experience specified adverse events \nand who, at the discretion of the investigator, could derive benefit from continuing treatment \non the protocol. \n \nAdverse events with an onset during therapy with trial medication or within 28 days after \ndiscontinuation of drug intake are considered as \u201con-treatment\u201d. Adverse events which are \nnot yet recovered at the End of Treatment visit will be followed up until recovery or in case \nof persistence sufficient characterisation of the toxic effects has been achieved and the \ninvestigator and Boehringer Ingelheim agree not to pursue them further. Adverse events that \noccur between Follow-up 1 (21 days after End of Treatment) and the final follow-up visit \n(see Section 6.1.4 for definition) will only be reported if they are considered related to trial \nmedication or procedures by the investigator. \n \nAdverse events occurring after the final follow-up visit (during the observation period) will \nbe reported only if considered serious (SAEs) and related to trial medication. Data regarding \ndeaths which are not related to trial medication will be collected for the purposes of assessing \nthe overall survival endpoint but these deaths will not be reported as SAEs. \n \nA summary of the requirements is given in Table 5.2.1:1. \n \nTable 5.2.1:1 AE/SAE reporting requirements \n \nTime period \nReporting requirements \nScreening to Follow-up 1 (21 days after End \nof Treatment (EOT)) \nReport all AEs and SAEs regardless of \nrelatedness.

These and other \nhospitalisations planned at the beginning of the trial need not be reported as SAEs if they \nhave been documented at the screening visit and have been performed as planned. \n \nChanges observed in safety tests including blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiogram \n(ECG) and laboratory tests will be recorded as AEs and graded according to CTCAE, if they \nare not associated with an already reported AE, symptom or diagnosis, and meet at least one \nof the following criteria: \n \n\u2022 \nAction is required and taken with the investigational drug, i.e., dose reduction or \ntreatment discontinuation \n \n\u2022 \nTreatment is required (i.e., a concomitant medication is added or changed). \n \n5.2.2 Worsening of pre-existing conditions \nExpected fluctuations or expected deterioration of the underlying disease will not be recorded \nas an AE. If progressive disease occurs and is associated with symptoms or meets one of the \nseriousness criteria (see Section 8.4.1), the signs and symptoms of progressive disease will be \nreported as an adverse event or a serious AE (if applicable). \n \nThe only exception to the above is in the event of a death which is attributed to progressive \ndisease but where the signs and symptoms are not available. In this situation it is acceptable \nto report the progressive disease as the serious AE. \n \nA pre-existing condition present at baseline, which remains unchanged during the trial, does \nnot need to be recorded as adverse event. However, any worsening of any pre-existing \nbaseline condition should be reported as an adverse event. Examples of worsening of a \npreexisting condition that should be recorded as an AE are given below; \n \n\u2022 \nWorsening of condition meets the criteria for an SAE \n \n\u2022 \nAction is taken with the investigational drug (i.e. dose is reduced or treatment is \ndiscontinued) \n \n\u2022 \nTreatment is required (concomitant medication is added or changed) \n \n\u2022 \nThe investigator believes a patient has shown a clear deterioration from baseline \nsymptoms \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n48\n5.2.3 Assessment of Healthcare Resource use \nIf patients are hospitalised due to adverse events, the reason for hospitalisation, the duration \nof hospital stay, emergency room admission and time in the intensive care unit will be \ndocumented in the CRF. Adverse event related outpatient visits and interventions will also be \ndocumented in the CRF. \n \nInformation on caregiver support (home care), hospital and outpatient visits (other than \nscheduled visits) collected in the CRF will inform on healthcare resource use required to treat \nthe trial indication and adverse events observed during the trial. The data collected will be \nused for a later health economic (cost-effectiveness) analysis. \n \n5.2.4 Laboratory investigations \nBlood samples will be collected at the time points specified in the Flow Chart and analysed in \na laboratory facility at (or close to) the investigational site. Safety laboratory examinations \ninclude haematology and biochemistry. In case of neutropenia, blood will be examined as \nclinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator until recovery. \n \nFor patients randomized to Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy (Arm B) the decision to \ncontinue treatment will be based on assessment of laboratory parameters. Therefore the \nresults of these assessments should be available and assessed on the day of treatment prior to \ncommencing treatment. \n \nSafety laboratory assessment may be performed according to local practice but must include \nat least the following parameters: \n \nHaematology            Red blood cell count (RBC), neutrophils, haemoglobin, hematocrit, \nwhite blood cell count (WBC) and differential, platelets. \n \nBiochemistry  \nGlucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, aspartate amino \ntransferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline \nphosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, urea \n(BUN), total protein, uric acid, creatine phosphokinase (CPK). In case \nof pathological CPK further evaluation (e.g., by Troponin assays) \nshould be performed and the findings documented in the CRF. \nGlomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) will be estimated by the Cockgroft-\nGault Formula utilizing serum creatinine values. \n \nUrinalysis  \npH, glucose, erythrocytes, leukocytes, protein, nitrite will be analysed \nby dipstick. In case of abnormal findings, further evaluation (g/24 hrs \nurine sampling) should be performed and the findings documented in \nthe CRF. \n \nPregnancy test  \n\u03b2-HCG testing in urine will be performed in women of childbearing \npotential at screening (SV2). \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n49\nAt screening, creatinine clearance for study eligibility may be measured or may be calculated \nusing the Cockroft-Gault Formula. \n \n5.2.5 Physical examination, performance score \nA physical examination will be performed at screening and at the time points specified in the \nFlow Chart. \n \nA full physical exam serves as a clinical tumour assessment and should include a \ncardiopulmonary examination, examination of the regional lymph nodes, examination of the \nabdomen and an assessment of the mental and neurological status. Additional symptoms \nwhich have not been reported during a previous examination should be clarified. Wherever \npossible the same investigator should perform this examination. \n \nA limited physical examination should include a cardiopulmonary examination, a clinical \ntumour assessment, an examination of the regional lymph nodes and an examination of the \nabdomen. \n \nMeasurement of height (in cm) and body weight (in kg) and the evaluation of the ECOG \nperformance score will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart. \n \n5.2.6 ECG \nA 12-lead resting ECG will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart. \nECGs will be performed using a digital ECG machine and the data will be sent to a central \nassessment centre for evaluation. \n \nThe investigator should also review the ECG data at the time of the visit and this will be used \nto make decisions on eligibility for the study and treatment. However, the investigator should \nalso review the results of the central review when received. \n \n5.2.7 Left ventricular function \nLeft Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) as measured by echocardiography or MUGA scan \nwill be assessed at time points specified in the Flow Chart.

The results of local analysis of EGFR mutation status will not be accepted \nfor study enrolment. \n \nEGFR mutation analysis will be performed at Screening visit 1. Tumour material will be \nsubmitted to the central laboratory as at least five (5), but preferably seven (7), 10 \u00b5m \nunstained sections mounted on non-charged microscopic slides as described in the Laboratory \nManual and in the Investigator Site File (ISF). If an equivalent quantity of material is \navailable as sections of different thickness, this is acceptable (e.g. 6 x 7.5 \u00b5m, 8 x 5 \u00b5m). It is \nrecommended that the sections should contain at least 20% tumour pathology. \n \nTumour tissue should be paraffin-embedded material obtained from initial diagnostic surgery \nfor NSCLC. If a tumour biopsy is performed as part of routine clinical practice prior to trial \nparticipation and material is available for analysis, the biopsy does not need to be repeated. If \ntissue is available from more than one occasion, the latest obtained tissue should be used \nwherever possible. The site of biopsy (primary tumour or metastatic site) will be recorded in \nthe eCRF. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n53\nDNA extraction, amplification and quantification using real-time PCR will be performed as \ndescribed in detail in the Laboratory Manual in the ISF. Mutation genotyping of the most \ncommon activating EGFR mutations will be conducted using an established quantitative real-\ntime PCR protocol together with fluorescence detection (Therascreen: EGFR29, DxS \nLimited). In addition, a central pathology review will be performed, including assessment of \npercentage of tumour involvement, but this will not be reported to investigators. \n \nThe following somatic EGFR mutations are detected; \n \n\u2022 19 deletions in exon 19 \n \n\u2022 L858R \n \n\u2022 3 insertions in exon 20 \n \n\u2022 L861Q \n \n\u2022 G719S, G719A and G719C \n \n\u2022 T790M \n \n\u2022 S768I \n \nSamples testing positive for one of these mutations will be reported as 'Positive' and the \npatient will be eligible for Screening Visit 2. The stratification category and the type of \nmutation will be specified in the report to the investigator. If a mutation is not detected, the \nresult will be reported as 'Negative' and the patient will be recorded as a Screen Failure. In \nthe event that the EGFR mutation test is inconclusive the investigator is allowed to send \nfurther material for testing if desired. \n \nIn addition, a blood sample will be collected on Course 1 day 1 for EGFR mutation analysis. \nThis sample is compulsory but the results will not be reported to investigators \n \nDuring follow-up (after progression) a further blood sample and tissue sample for EGFR \nmutation analysis may be taken but are optional. The sample requirements are the same as \nthose at screening. \n \nMaterial submitted for EGFR mutation analysis may be used for the validation of alternative \nmethods for detection of EGFR mutations, which may include detection of additional \nmutations. The results of these analyses will not be reported to investigators. If local \nregulations allow, any excess material will be shipped and stored at Boehringer Ingelheim, \nGermany until any required validation has taken place or until it is decided that there is no \nrequirement for validation. Samples will be destroyed at the latest 5 years after the last patient \nstudy visit. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n54\n \nIf both L858R and a deletion in exon 19 are detected in the same sample, the patient will be \nallocated to the \u2018L858R\u2019 stratificatkion category.

Donation of this blood sample for pharmacogenetics is voluntary and not a \nprerequisite for participation in the study. The sample will only be taken and processed or \nstored after separate informed consent is given in accordance with local ethical and \nregulatory requirements. \n \nThe blood sample for pharmacogenetic analysis will be anonymised. The anonymisation \nprocedure will guarantee the legally required level of data protection for the donor. Once the \nanonymisation has been carried out, there will be no legal way to trace back to the identity of \nthe donor. The anonymised DNA may be analysed at a later time to identify whether there are \ngenetic factors that could contribute to a better therapeutic outcome or a higher risk of \ndeveloping treatment-related adverse drug reactions. These analyses may include genes \nrelated to efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics. The sample (or the DNA derived from it) \nwill be stored at Boehringer Ingelheim for 15 years after the end of the clinical trial or until \nthere is no more material available for tests. \n \nThe pharmacogenetic sampling will not be performed in countries where local regulations \nprohibit the shipment of biological materials to Germany. \n \n5.6.2.1 Methods and timing of sample collection \nIf consent is given, the sample for pharmacogenetic testing may be taken at any time after \nrandomization, but preferably on Day 1 of Course 1. A maximum of 8.5 mL blood will be \ncollected in a PaxGene DNA blood sampling tube. The Paxgene Blood DNA tubes can be \nstored and shipped at room temperature within 14 days. If a longer storage and shipment \nperiod for Paxgene Blood DNA tubes is necessary, the blood samples have to be stored at a \ntemperature of -20 centigrade or below. Once frozen, thawing of the samples should be \navoided. Detailed instructions for pharmacogenetic sampling, handling and shipment of \nsamples are provided in the ISF \n \n5.6.2.2 Analytical determinations \nGenomic DNA will be extracted from blood samples according to standard molecular \ngenetics methods and analysed by TaqMan\u00ae\uf020or other standard genotyping technologies. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n55\n \n5.7 \nPHARMACOKINETIC - PHARMACODYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP \nCorrelation between drug concentration and response may be made if adequate appropriate \ndata are available.

At \nScreening Visit 1, biopsy material will be analysed by a central laboratory for EGFR \nmutation status. Patients who test positive for an EGFR mutation will proceed to Screening \nVisit 2, when full assessments will take place. \n \nAll Screening Visit 2 procedures must be performed in the 28 days prior to the first \nadministration of study medication. \n \nPatients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized and treatment must commence \nwithin 2 days after randomization. \n \n6.1.2 \nTreatment \nPatients randomized to arm A (BIBW 2992) will receive continuous daily treatment until the \ncriteria for stopping medication are met (see Section 6.3.1). For administrative purposes \ntreatment is divided into courses, which are each 3 weeks (21 days) in duration. \n \nPatients randomized to arm B (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy) will receive up to 6 \ncourses of treatment, each 21 days in length. Treatment may be discontinued prior to 6 \ncourses if the criteria for stopping medication are met (see Section 6.3.1). \n \nDuring the treatment phase visits should be performed as scheduled wherever possible, but \nwithin 2 days of the scheduled date. \n \n6.1.3 \nEnd of Treatment visit \nAll patients should be evaluated at the end of treatment (EOT). \n \nIn arm A (BIBW 2992) the EOT visit should be performed within 14 days of permanent \ndiscontinuation of BIBW 2992. If the decision to discontinue BIBW 2992 is taken during a \nscheduled visit, the EOT visit should be performed instead of the scheduled visit. \n \nIn arm B (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy) the EOT visit should be performed 21 days \n(\u00b1 7 days) after course 6 day 1. If the patient does not complete 6 courses of treatment, the \nvisit should be performed within 14 days of the decision to end treatment. \n \n6.1.4 \nFollow-up \nAll patients should have the first follow-up visit (FU1) 21 days (\u00b1 7 days) after the EOT visit. \nThis visit should be performed regardless of whether the patient has commenced further \ntreatment. If the patient has already started another treatment at the first follow-up, the visit \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n57\nshould still be performed and the new treatment should be recorded as concomitant \nmedication. \n \nPatients who have not progressed and not started further treatment at the first follow-up visit \nshould have further follow-up visits every 21 days (\u00b1 7 days) until progression or start of \nfurther treatment. \n \nPatients will be considered to have completed the study at the follow-up visit where \nprogression is first documented or where further treatment has begun. This follow-up visit \nwill be termed the 'final follow-up visit'. \n \n6.1.5 \nObservation period \nAfter completion of the study patients will enter an observation period. During the \nobservation period no study visits will be performed, but data regarding progression, further \ntreatment (including best response and reason for stopping treatment) and death will be \ncollected every 60 days (\u00b1 15 days) until death. Information will be collected from the patient \nnotes or by telephone contact with the patient. \n \nThe observation period will end after all patients have died or 5 years after the last follow up \nvisit, whichever occurs first. \n \n6.1.6 \nTreatment after the End of Study \nFollowing progression, patients should receive adequate further treatment to prevent a \ntreatment bias between the two arms. \n \nIt is recommended that patients who progress after receiving BIBW 2992 in the clinical trial \nare subsequently treated with standard platinum-based combination chemotherapy if eligible. \nLicensed single-agent chemotherapy can be considered if patients are unable to tolerate \ncombination chemotherapy. \n \nIt is recommended that patients who progress after receiving first-line chemotherapy in the \nclinical trial should receive standard second line treatment with single agent chemotherapy \nand/or a licensed EGFR TKI, as long as they are clinically eligible.  \n \nSecond-line therapy should only be started following an objective and confirmed progression. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n58\n \n6.2 \nTRIAL PROCEDURES AT EACH VISIT \n6.2.1 \nScreening and run-in in phases \nScreening Visit 1 \nScreening Visit 1 should be performed within 6 weeks of the first administration of study \nmedication \nInformed Consent 1 \nWritten informed consent must be obtained \nbefore any study-specific screening \nassessments are performed.

The primary \nobjective of the statistical analysis is to determine whether BIBW 2992 prolongs progression-\nfree survival (PFS) in comparison to chemotherapy. \n \n7.2 \nNULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES \nThe alternative hypothesis of the primary analysis is that the progression-free survival time is \nlonger for patients treated with BIBW 2992 than for those who receive chemotherapy.  That \nis \n \nHA: SBIBW(t) > SChemo(t), for t>0 \nThe null hypothesis tested by this trial is: \n \nH0: SBIBW(t) \u2264 SChemo(t), for t>0 \nwhere S(t) is the probability that a patient passes time t without dying or experiencing disease \nprogression. The subscripts represent the two treatment groups.  The null hypothesis will be \ntested at the one-sided 0.025 level. \nIf the difference between the treatment groups for the primary efficacy endpoint is \nstatistically significant then formal statistical testing will be performed on the key secondary \nendpoints. In order to protect the overall type I error rate a closed testing procedure will be \nemployed, whereby each key secondary endpoint will only be formally analysed if the \nprevious endpoint was found to be statistically significant. The key secondary endpoints will \nbe analysed according to the order they are presented in Section 7.3.2 below. \n \n7.3 \nPLANNED ANALYSES \nThe primary analyses will include all randomized patients. \n \n7.3.1 \nPrimary analyses \nThe primary endpoint of this study is progression-free survival, defined as the time from the \ndate of randomisation to the date of disease progression, or to the date of death if a patient \ndied earlier. The analysis will be based upon the evaluation of tumour imaging as reviewed \nby an independent central unit, blinded to treatment assignments. \nThe primary analysis of PFS will be conducted when at least 217 patients have progressed or \ndied.  This is expected to take approximately 19-20 months, assuming 330 patients are \nrandomised over a period of 9-10 months. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n68\nA stratified log-rank test will be used to test for the effect of BIBW 2992. The test will be \nstratified by EGFR mutation (L858R vs. del 19 vs. other).  \nA Cox proportional-hazards model will be used to derive the hazard ratio and 95 % \nconfidence interval between the two randomised regimens.  Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% \nCI will be calculated at the time of each planned imaging assessment. \nDisease progression will be evaluated according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria (R09-0262), with \nadaptations as described in the imaging charter. \nFor patients with known date of progression (or death): \n\u2022 PFS [days] = earlier of date of progression or death \u2013 date of randomisation + 1. \n \nPatients with unknown disease progression status or date, or who are treated with new \nanticancer therapy will be handled as described in Section 7.4 \n \n7.3.2 \nSecondary analyses \n7.3.2.1 Key Secondary analyses \nThe following key secondary analyses will be performed according to the statistical testing \nstrategy detailed in Section 7.2 \n7.3.2.1.1 Best RECIST assessment \nEach patient will be assigned to one of the following RECIST 1.1 categories based on \nindependent central review, irrespective of protocol violations or missing data:  \n\u2022 CR (complete response) \n\u2022 PR (partial response) \n\u2022 SD (stable disease) \n\u2022 PD (progressive disease) \n\u2022 Not evaluable (not assessable, insufficient data) \n \nObjective response is defined as CR and PR. Time to objective response is the time from \nrandomisation to the date of first documented CR or PR. The duration of objective response \nis the time from first documented CR or PR to the time of progression or death. Disease \ncontrol is defined as CR, PR, and/or SD.  \nLogistic regression will be used to test for a difference between regimens for objective \nresponse and for disease control. The statistical model will include the same stratification \nfactor used for the analysis of PFS.  Nominal significance levels will be reported. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n69\nObjective response will be tabulated both overall and within EGFR mutation categories.  \nDescriptive statistics will be calculated for the duration of objective response and duration of \ndisease control. \n7.3.2.1.2 Overall survival (OS)  \nThe treatment regimens will be compared in terms of time to death, but unequal treatment \nafter progression is expected to obscure any effect of BIBW 2992 relative to chemotherapy.  \nSimilarly to PFS, the stratified log-rank test will be used to test OS.   \nOS will be analyzed twice. The first analysis will be performed at the time of the primary \nPFS analysis.  A second analysis will be performed somewhat later with the aim of providing \nas much information as possible on OS.  With 330 patients randomised over a period of 9-10 \nmonths and a median time to death of 20 months (HR= 1.0), approximately 219 deaths would \nbe expected within 36 months. \nTo preserve the overall 0.025, one-sided alpha-level, a Haybittle-Peto stopping boundary will \nbe used (p-value <0.0001) for the analysis of OS performed at the time of the primary PFS \nanalysis. \nIn addition to the formal treatment comparison, the analyses will describe the overall pattern \nof time to death, together with the extent and influence of post-progression treatment.  \nThe following analyses will examine the pattern of time to death for consistency with the PFS \nresults, while accounting for the extent and influence of post-progression intervention: \n\u2022 \ntest for a difference between treatment regimens at six, nine, and twelve months, \n\u2022 \ndescribe the cumulative proportion of deaths at each scheduled tumour assessment time \npoint \n\u2022 \ntabulate the specific anti-cancer treatments after progression \n\u2022 \ndescribe the effect of additional anti-cancer treatment, by separating patients into the \nfollowing sub-groups \n\ufffd \nthose not eligible for additional treatment \no \npatients who did not progress \no \npatients who died within one month of progression \n\ufffd \nthose eligible for additional treatment \no \ndid not take additional treatment \no \ndid take additional treatment  \n7.3.2.2 Other secondary analyses \nThe following other secondary analyses will be performed. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n70\n7.3.2.2.1 Sensitivity and exploratory analyses for PFS  \nThe timing of imaging assessments will be described.  In order to account for the possible \neffect of mistimed or delayed imaging assessments, a sensitivity analyses will assign the \nmidpoint to PFS failures within time intervals that will be formed around the planned times \nof imaging assessments. \nAn additional analysis will assign all patients who progress in the chemotherapy arm to the \nlater assessment of progression (investigator or independent central unit review) and all \npatients who progress in the BIBW 2992 arm to the earliest assessment of progression. \nAn exploratory analysis will stratify the log-rank test by each of the EGFR mutations for \nwhich there are sufficient randomized patients. \nDescriptive methods (e.g. Forest plot) and Cox proportional-hazards will be used to examine \nthe effects of other baseline disease characteristics and demographic factors, including the \nstratification factor (EGFR mutation category), baseline sum of target lesions, geographical \nregion, ECOG, gender, and age. \n7.3.2.2.2 Tumour shrinkage  \nThe two treatment groups will be compared in terms of the minimum sum of target lesion \ndiameters recorded for each patient after randomisation, as measured by central imaging.  \nThe analysis will compare the treatments using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for \nminimum sum of diameters, using baseline sum of diameters as a covariate.  The \nrandomization stratum will be included as a classification factor. \n7.3.2.2.3 Body weight and ECOG performance status \nAnalyses will compare the treatment groups in terms of time to deterioration of: \n\u2022 body weight, defined as the first occurrence of a decrease from baseline of more than \n10 %, and \n\u2022 ECOG performance status, defined as the first instance of an increase in ECOG \ncategory. \n \nPatients who die before deteriorating will be analysed as having deteriorated at the time of \ndeath. Disease progression without deterioration will be censored at the time of the last \nmeasurement of weight or ECOG performance status. \nTime to deterioration will be analysed similarly to PFS i.e. by stratified log-rank test. \n7.3.2.2.4 Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL)  \nThe relevant HRQOL endpoints are the time to deterioration for the following three symptom \nscales/items measured on the QLQ-C30 or QLQ-LC13 questionnaire (R99-1213, R07-2060):  \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n71\n\u2022 cough (Question 1 on the QLQ-LC13),  \n\u2022 dyspnoea (composite of Questions 3-5 on the QLQ-LC13),  \n\u2022 pain (composite of Questions 9 and 19 on the QLQ-C30) \nScoring of the symptom scales/items will follow the EORTC scoring algorithm. For ease of \ninterpretation, a linear transformation will be used to standardise the raw scores of all items \nand scales, so that scores range from 0 to 100 (R07-2064). A higher score represents a higher \n(\u2018better\u2019) level of functioning (functional scales, global health status/QOL), or a higher \n(\u2018worse\u2019) level of symptoms (symptom scale/item) (R07-2064). \nTime to deterioration for the cough, dyspnoea, pain and symptom scales/items will be defined \nas the time to a 10-point increase from the baseline score (R07-2064, R99-1223, R07-2061).  \nPatients who die before deteriorating will be analysed as having deteriorated at the time of \ndeath. Disease progression without scale deterioration will be censored at the time of the last \nscale measurement. Patients with no HRQOL assessments will be censored at day of \nrandomisation. If a HRQOL assessment is missed, but followed by another assessment and \ndeterioration occurs during that period, the time to deterioration will be defined as the \nmidpoint between the two observed assessments. In addition, the three alternative measures \nof pain (Questions 10-12* in QLQ-LC13) will be examined descriptively for consistency \nwith the composite of questions 9 and 19 from the QLQ-C30, as will dyspnoea (Question 8) \nfrom the EORTC QLQ-C30 be compared with the dyspnoea composite (Questions 3-5* on \nthe QLQ-LC13). \nTime to deterioration will be analysed similarly to PFS i.e. log-rank test stratified by the \nstratification factor used at randomisation will be used to test for the effect of BIBW 2992.  \nThe individual items of the symptom scales will be examined for consistency with the \ncomposites.  \nIn addition, a comprehensive analysis of all subscales/items (where a single item is scored, \nR07-2064) will estimate the hazard ratio for time to deterioration with 95% confidence. The \nresults of these analyses will be displayed using a Forest plot to summarise the impact of \ntherapy over the entire profile of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 measures. \nAdditional analysis will describe the distribution of patients that are improved, stable, or \nworsened for each of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 summary scales and items (where a \nsingle item is scored, R07-2061). \n* Note that questions on the QLQ-LC13 are numbered consecutively following the QLQ-C30 \nas shown in Appendix 4. Consequently, Question 1 is numbered as Question 31 and \nQuestions 3-5 as Questions 33-35 \n \n7.3.3 \nSafety analyses \nAll randomised and treated patients will be included in the analysis of safety. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n72\nThe primary analysis of adverse events will be based upon events that start on or after first \nadministration of trial medication and within 28 days after the last administration trial \nmedication.  An additional analysis will compare the treatment regimens over a period of \ntime equivalent to six courses of chemotherapy. \nAdverse events as well as laboratory parameters will be graded according to CTCAE, \nVersion 3.0 (R04-0474).  Key safety measures will include: \n\u2022 events leading to dose reduction \n\u2022 events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation \n\u2022 the overall incidence and intensity of adverse events, as well as relatedness of adverse \nevents to treatment \n\u2022 causes of death \n\u2022 gastrointestinal events (diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea) \n\u2022 cutaneous reactions \n\u2022 oral irritation \n\u2022 decreased renal function \n\u2022 elevated liver function tests, \n\u2022 haematological abnormalities (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade 2 with increase by at least one CTCAE grade from baseline, for selected \nlaboratory tests:  \n\u2022 (high values) INR, PTT, creatinine, AST, ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, \nproteinuria (dipstick or [g/24 hrs]) \n\u2022 (low values) haemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, total WBC \n\u2022 descriptive statistics for change from baseline for all laboratory tests   \n \nAdditional, more in-depth analyses will be performed as needed.  These analyses will \nexamine the influence of extent of exposure and time to event onset. \nKey adverse event tables will be reproduced to examine the effect of BIBW 2992 among \nspecial populations e.g. elderly, females. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n73\n7.3.4 \nInterim analyses \nA Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the safety data approximately \nevery six months. In order to completely assess the risk-benefit advantage of BIBW 2992, the \ncommittee may see the need during such regular meetings to examine survival and PFS. \nHowever, the significance level for the primary analysis of PFS will not be adjusted for the \ninterim looks by the DMC.  This is because the trial will not be stopped for superiority of \nBIBW 2992 vs. chemotherapy in terms of PFS prior to the primary analysis, which is \nscheduled to occur after 217 PFS failures. \n \n7.3.5 \nPharmacokinetic methods \nBIBW 2992 plasma concentrations will be summarized by time point by descriptive statistics \nand, if feasible, graphically inspected. A pharmacokinetic correlation plot analysis will be \nperformed on BIBW 2992 plasma concentrations.  \nObjectives of this analysis will be: \n\u2022 describe the trough BIBW 2992 plasma concentrations at steady state in the target \npatient population \n\u2022 to estimate the inter-individual and intra-individual variability of BIBW 2992 trough \nplasma concentrations  \n\u2022 to estimate the influence of covariates such as age, gender or weight on the variability \nof the BIBW 2992 trough plasma concentrations using correlation plot analysis \n7.4 \nHANDLING OF MISSING DATA \nThe central imaging unit will work with the clinical sites towards a standard implementation \nof the RECIST 1.1 criteria. An imaging charter will detail all procedures, including quality \ncontrol and the criteria needed to handle missing assessments.  \nPatients will continue to be followed for both progression and death after discontinuation of \nstudy treatment. \nTable 7.4: 1 describes how patients will be classified for the analysis of PFS.

Standard medical care (prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic \nprocedures) remains in the responsibility of the treating physician of the patient. \n \nThe terms and conditions of the insurance cover are made available to the investigator and \nthe patients via documentation in the ISF (Investigator Site File). \n \n8.1 \nETHICS \n8.1.1 \nIndependent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board \nThe trial will not be initiated before the protocol and informed consent and patient \ninformation form have been reviewed and received approval / favourable opinion from the \nlocal Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and approval \nby / notification to the Competent Authority (CA) / regulatory authority as required according \nto national regulations. \n \nShould a Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP) amendment be made that needs IRB / IEC approval \nand authority notification/approval, the changes in the CTP will not be instituted until the \namendment and revised informed consent (if appropriate) have been reviewed and received \napproval / favourable opinion from the local IRB / IEC and the CA / regulatory authority has \nbeen notified / provided approval (as required according to local regulations). A CTP \namendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be \nimplemented immediately providing that the regulatory authority and IRB / IEC are notified \nas soon as possible and an approval is requested. CTP amendments exclusively for logistical \nor administrative changes may be implemented with notification to the IRB / IEC and CA \nonly. \n \nThe constitution of the IRB / IEC must meet the requirements of ICH GCP and of the \nparticipating country. A list of the IRB / IEC members who attended the meeting when the \nCTP / CTP amendment was discussed, including names and qualifications, needs to be \nprovided by the IRB / IEC to the investigator or sponsor (according to local practice). The \ninvestigator or sponsor (according to local practice) must provide to the regulatory authorities \nthe name and address of the IRB / IEC along with a statement from the IRB / IEC that it is \norganised according to GCP and the applicable laws and regulations. The IRB / IEC must \nperform all duties outlined by the requirements of ICH GCP and of the participating country. \n \n8.1.2 \nPatient Information and Informed Consent \nPrior to patient participation in the trial, a signed and dated written informed consent must be \nobtained from each patient (or the patient\u2019s legally accepted representative) according to ICH \nGCP and to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. Each signature \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n77\nmust be personally dated by each signatory and the informed consent and any additional \npatient-information form retained by the investigator as part of the trial records. A signed \ncopy of the informed consent and any additional patient information must be given to each \npatient or the patient\u2019s legally accepted representative. \n \nThe patient must be informed that his/her personal trial-related data will be used by \nBoehringer Ingelheim in accordance with the local data protection law. The level of \ndisclosure must also be explained to the patient. \n \nThe patient must be informed that his / her medical records may be examined by authorized \nmonitors (Clinical Monitor Local (CML)/Clinical Research associate (CRA)) or Clinical \nQuality Assurance auditors appointed by Boehringer Ingelheim, by appropriate IRB / IEC \nmembers, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. \n \nShould a CTP amendment become necessary, the patient consent form and patient \ninformation form may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the CTP. It is the \nresponsibility of the investigator or sponsor (according to local practice) to ensure that an \namended consent form is reviewed and has received approval / favourable opinion from the \nIRB / IEC and the CA / regulatory authority has provided approval / has been notified (as \nrequired according to local regulations), and that it is signed by all patients subsequently \nentered in the trial and those currently in the trial, if affected by the amendment. \n \n8.2 \nRECORDS \n8.2.1 \nDrug accountability \nDrug supplies must be kept in a secure, limited access storage area under the storage \nconditions defined by the sponsor. Where necessary, a temperature log must be maintained to \nmake certain that the drug supplies are stored at the correct temperature. \n \nThe investigator and/or pharmacist must maintain records of the product\u2019s delivery to the trial \nsite, the inventory at the site, the use by each patient, and the return to the sponsor or \nalternative disposition of unused product(s). These records will include dates, quantities, \nbatch/serial numbers, expiry (\u2018use by\u2019) dates, and the unique code numbers assigned to the \ninvestigational product(s) and trial patients. The investigator / pharmacist will maintain \nrecords that document adequately that the patients were provided the doses specified by the \nCTP and reconcile all investigational product(s) received from the sponsor. At the time of \nreturn to the sponsor the investigator / pharmacist must verify that all unused or partially used \ndrug supplies have been returned by the clinical trial patient and that no remaining supplies \nare in the investigator\u2019s possession. \n \n8.2.2 \nEmergency code break \nNot applicable. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n78\n8.2.3 \nCase Report Forms (CRFs) \nAll the clinical data will be captured via electronic data capture (EDC) using the Oracle \nClinical Remote Data Capture system, a web-based tool. The investigator site staff will enter \nand edit the data via a secure network, with secure access features (username, password and \nsecure identification or username and password \u2013 an electronic password system). A \ncomplete electronic audit trail will be maintained. The investigator will approve the data \nusing an electronic signature (Ref: 21 CFR Part 11), and this approval is used to confirm the \naccuracy of the data recorded. \n \nElectronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be used for all patients. The investigator\u2019s data will be \naccessible from the investigator\u2019s site throughout the trial. Relevant medical history prior to \nenrolment will be documented at the baseline visit. Thereafter during the trial, narrative \nstatements relative to the patient\u2019s progress during the trial will be maintained. The electronic \nCRFs must be kept current to reflect patient status at each phase during the course of the trial. \nThe patients must not be identified on the electronic CRF by name. Appropriate coded \nidentification (i.e. Patient Number) must be used. The investigator must make a separate \nconfidential record of these details (patient identification code list) to permit identification of \nall patients enrolled in a clinical trial in case follow-up is required. While a trial is ongoing \nand until the access to the database has been terminated, there will be no Documentation of \nChanges (DOCs). All changes will be requested from the investigator through the EDC \nsystem. If a change is necessary once the investigator has no further access to the database, a \nDOC will be sent to the investigator for confirmation of the change. The investigator\u2019s \nsignature or seal is requested to show he/she agrees with the change that was made. The \noriginal DOC is kept by the investigator. \n \nCopies of the electronic CRF together with all data changes made will be supplied to the \ninvestigator at the end of the trial. The investigator will be responsible for retaining all \nrecords pertaining to the trial as specified in the appropriate contract. \n \n8.2.4 \nSource documents \nSource documents provide evidence for the existence of the patient and substantiate the \nintegrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator\u2019s site. \nData reported on the CRFs or entered in the CRFs that are transcribed from source documents \nmust be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The \ninvestigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on \nthe trial; also current medical records must be available. \nFor eCRFs all data must be derived from source documents, including the following: \n\u2022 \nPatients identification (gender, date of birth) \n\u2022 Patients participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date patient \nwas informed) \n\u2022 \nDates of patient\u2019s visits, including dispensing of trial medication \n\u2022 \nMedical history (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable) \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n79\n\u2022 \nMedication history \n\u2022 \nAdverse events (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if available)) \n\u2022 \nSerious adverse events (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if available)) \n\u2022 \nConcomitant therapy (start date, changes) \n\u2022 \nOriginals or copies of laboratory results (in validated electronic format, if available) \n\u2022 \nConclusion of Patient\u2019s Participation in the trial \n \n8.2.5 \nDirect access to source data - documents \nThe investigator / institution will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review \nand regulatory inspection, providing direct access to all related source data / documents. \nCRFs and all source documents, including progress notes and copies of laboratory and \nmedical test results must be available at all times for review by the sponsor\u2019s clinical trial \nmonitor, auditor and inspection by health authorities (e.g. sFDA). The Clinical Research \nAssociate (CRA) or on-site monitor may review all CRFs, and written informed consents. \nThe accuracy of the data will be verified by reviewing the documents described in Section \n8.2.4. \n \nData collected during the Observation Period will be checked for completeness and \nplausibility but will not require source data verification. \n \n8.3 \nQUALITY ASSURANCE AUDIT \nA quality assurance audit of this trial may be conducted by the sponsor or sponsor\u2019s \ndesignees. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the \ninvestigator\u2019s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation \nof this clinical trial. \n \n8.4 \nPROCEDURES \n8.4.1 \nAdverse events \nAn adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an \nexacerbation of a pre-existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a \npharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship \nwith this treatment. \n \nAll adverse events occurring during the course of the clinical trial (i.e., from signing the \ninformed consent to the final follow-up visit) will be collected, documented and reported to \nthe sponsor by the investigator according to the specific definitions and instructions detailed \nin the \u2018Adverse Event Reporting\u2019 section of the Investigator Site File. \n \nA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately \nlife-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, requires or prolongs \npatient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for \nany other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n80\njudgment which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention \nto prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. \n \nAll adverse events, serious and non-serious, will be fully documented on the appropriate \nCRFs. For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset, end, CTCAE grade \n(R04-0474), treatment required, outcome, seriousness and action taken with the \ninvestigational drug. The investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational \ndrug to all AEs as defined in the 'Adverse Event Reporting' Section of the Investigator Site \nFile. \n \nThere are no events defined as 'significant' for this study. All events will be categorised as \neither Adverse Event (AE) or Serious Adverse Event (SAE). \n \nThe basis for judging the causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE \nis described below. \n \nCausal relationship \n \nMedical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant \nfactors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, \nconfounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant \nhistory. Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms. \n \n\ufffd \nYes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational drug \nadministered and the AE. \n \n\ufffd \nNo: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational drug \nadministered and the AE. \n \nThe investigator has the obligation to report all AEs/ SAEs occurring between informed \nconsent and follow-up visit 1, regardless of causality. From follow-up 1 to final follow-up the \ninvestigator should report all AEs/SAEs which are related to the study treatment or \nprocedures. During the observation period, only SAEs considered related to the study \ntreatment should be reported. Deaths occurring after follow-up 1 do not need to be reported \nas SAEs unless considered related to study treatment or procedures. \n \nSAEs are to be reported to the sponsor using the BI Serious Adverse Event Report Form \nincluding a documented causal relationship assessment and providing as much detail \nregarding the SAE as possible. When follow-up information becomes available, all remaining \nfields on the SAE form are to be completed or updated. \n \nAny serious AE, whether or not considered related to the investigational product, and \nwhether or not the investigational product has been administered, must be reported \nimmediately by telephone / fax to the sponsor. Expedited reporting of serious adverse events, \ne.g. suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), will be done according to \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n81\nlocal regulatory requirements. Further details regarding this reporting procedure are provided \nin the ISF. \n \nFollowing every such telephone / fax report, the Clinical Monitor must provide a written \nreport of the serious AE and any sequelae to Corporate Drug Safety according to the \nappropriate Corporate SOP(s).

Double barrier method of contraception is defined as two barrier methods \nused simultaneously each time the patient has intercourse. Accepted barrier methods include \ndiaphragm, female condom, cervical cap, male condom and IUD (the diaphragm and cervical \ncap must be used in conjunction with spermicidal jelly/cream). If hormonal contraceptives \nare used, at least one barrier method should also be used. Partner vasectomy, natural 'rhythm' \nand spermicidal jelly/cream are not acceptable as methods of contraception.  \n \nMale patients should use adequate contraception throughout the study (e.g. condom and \nspermicidal jelly). \n \nFemale patients must have a negative pregnancy test (\u03b2-HCG test in urine or serum) prior to \ncommencing study treatment. \nIf a patient is found to be pregnant during study participation, this should be handled as \nfollows;\n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n82\n \nTable 8.4.3: 1 Pregnancy reporting \nTiming of pregnancy \nAction \nPrior to commencing \nstudy medication \nPatient should be withdrawn from the study immediately. \nNo reporting necessary \nDuring study \ntreatment \nTreatment must be stopped immediately and the pregnancy should \nbe reported to the sponsor immediately using the pregnancy form. \nIf the investigator wishes to give any further treatment with study \nmedication, this must be discussed and agreed with the BI clinical \nmonitor. \nThe pregnancy should be followed up to final outcome and the \noutcome, including any premature termination should be reported \nto the sponsor on the pregnancy form. \nIn addition, any event leading to the termination of pregnancy (i.e. \nspontaneous, accidental, or induced abortion; as well as \nmiscarriage, intrauterine foetal demise/death) must be reported as \nan SAE. \nDuring follow-up \n(after finishing \ntreatment but before \nend of study \nparticipation). \nThe pregnancy should be reported to the sponsor immediately \nusing the pregnancy form. \nThe pregnancy should be followed up to final outcome and the \noutcome, including any premature termination should be reported \nto the sponsor on the pregnancy form. \nIn addition, any event leading to the termination of pregnancy (i.e. \nspontaneous, accidental, or induced abortion; as well as \nmiscarriage, intrauterine foetal demise/death) must be reported as \nan SAE. \nWithin 28 days of last \ndose of study \nmedication (even if no \nlonger participating in \nstudy \n \n8.5 \nRULES FOR AMENDING PROTOCOL \nAll CTP amendments must be documented, dated and signed by all signatories (or their \nsuccessors) of the original protocol.

The recommended supportive care for Gemcitabine / Cisplatin \nchemotherapy is as follows; \n \n\u2022 \nPre-treatment hydration with 1 - 2 litres of fluid infused for 8 - 12 hours prior \nto Cisplatin will initiate diuresis. Adequate subsequent hydration should \nmaintain diuresis during the 24 hours following administration. \n\u2022 \nAntiemetic treatment should follow the recommendations given in the \nConsensus Statement of the Antiemetic Subcommittee of the Multinational \nAssociation of Supportive Care in cancer (MASCC): Prevention of \nchemotherapy- and radiotherapyinduced emesis: Results of the Perugia \nConsensus Conference (R06-0986). \n \nDose Modification Scheme \n \nDosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity may be required for gemcitabine and \nfor cisplatin. Gemcitabine dosage adjustment for hematological toxicity is based on \nthe granulocyte and platelet counts taken on the day of therapy. Patients receiving \ngemcitabine should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count \n(CBC), including differential and platelet counts. If marrow suppression is \ndetected, therapy should be modified or suspended according to the guidelines in \nTable 10.2:1. \n \nIn general, for severe (Grade 3 or 4) non-hematological toxicity, except alopecia \nand nausea/vomiting, therapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin should be held or \ndecreased by 50% depending on the judgment of the treating physician. During \ncombination therapy with cisplatin, serum creatinine, serum potassium, serum \ncalcium, and serum magnesium should be carefully monitored (Grade 3/4 serum \ncreatinine toxicity for gemcitabine plus cisplatin was 5% versus 2% for cisplatin \nalone). \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n94\n \n \n \nTable 10.2:1 Dosage Reduction Guidelines for Gemcitabine in combination with \nCisplatin  \n \nAbsolute granulocyte count  \n(x 10\n6/L)  \n \nPlatelet count  \n(x 10\n6\n/L)  \n% of full dose  \n\u22651000  \nand  \n\u2265100,000  \n100 \n500-999  \nor  \n50,000-99,999  \n75  \n<500  \nor  \n<50,000  \nHold  \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n95\n \n \n10.3 \nAPPENDIX 3   QUESTIONNAIRES \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n96\n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n97\n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n98\n \n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n99\n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n100\n \n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n101\n \n \n10.4 \nAPPENDIX 4   RECIST 1.1 CRITERIA  \nThe criteria below are based on RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262). \n \nMeasurability of the disease \n \nMeasurable lesions \n \nLesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest \ndiameter \u2265 10 mm (by CT scan, MRI, caliper measurement) or \u2265 20 mm (by chest \nX-ray). \n \nMeasurable disease \n \nMeasurable disease requires the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the \nmeasurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be \nconfirmed by cytology/histology. \n \nNon-measurable disease \n \nNon-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest \ndiameter <10 mm with CT scan, MRI or caliper measurement or <20 mm with \nchest X-ray or pathological lymph nodes with shortest axis \u226510 and <15 mm) as \nwell as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly unmeasurable \ninclude leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, \ninflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal \nmasses/ abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not \nmeasurable by reproducible imaging techniques. \n \nNew lesions in irradiated fields \n \nPreviously irradiated lesions should not be used as indicator lesions. However, new \nlesions occurring in previously irradiated fields can be used to assess the \nantitumour response. \n \nMethods of measurement \n \nAll measurements must be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. \nAll baseline evaluations must be performed as close as possible to the treatment \nstart and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. If a lesion \nis considered too small to measure, a default measurement of 5mm should be \napplied. If the lesion is not visible, a default measurement of 0mm should be \napplied. \n \nThe same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to \ncharacterise each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. \nClinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., \nskin nodules, palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by \ncolour photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is obligatory. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n102\n \n \nCT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure \ntarget lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should \nbe performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT \nshould be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This \napplies to the chest, abdomen and pelvis. \n \nUltrasound, endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to measure tumour \nlesions or evaluate tumour response. However, these techniques can be useful to \nsupplement information from other techniques. \n \nTumour markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially \nabove the upper normal limit, they must normalise for a patient to be considered in \ncomplete clinical response. \n \nCytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare \ncases (for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, \nwhere known residual benign tumours can remain). \n \nBaseline Documentation of Target and Non-target Lesions \n \nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions \nin total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions \nand will be recorded, measured (longest diameter = LD) and numbered at baseline. \nTarget lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest \ndiameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by \nimaging techniques or clinically). Lymph nodes must be \u226515mm in order to be \nconsidered as target lesions. \n \nA sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and \nreported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to \nfurther characterize the objective tumour response of the measurable dimension of \nthe disease (see Table 10.4:1). \n \nTable 10.4:1 Evaluation of target lesions \nComplete Response \n(CR) \nDisappearance of all target lesions. \nPartial Response (PR)  \nAt least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target \nlesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. \nProgression (PD) \nAt least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target \nlesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD \nrecorded since the treatment started, together with an \nabsolute increase in the sum of LD of at least 5mm. OR  \nThe appearance of one or more new lesions. \nStable Disease (SD)  \n \nNeither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, taking as \nreference the baseline sum LD, nor sufficient increase to \nqualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum LD \nsince the treatment started. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n103\n \n \n \nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and \nshould also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these \nlesions should be followed as \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cabsent\u201d (see Table 10.4:2). \n \nTable 10.4:2  Evaluation of non-target lesions and new lesions \nComplete \nResponse (CR) \nDisappearance of all non-target lesions and normalisation of \ntumour marker level. \nNon-CR/ Non-PD  \nPersistence of one or more non-target lesions or/and \nmaintenance of tumour marker level above normal limits. \nProgression (PD) \nAppearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal \nprogression of existing non-target lesions. \n \nAlthough a clear progression of non-target lesions only is \nexceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the \ntreating physician should prevail and the progression status \nshould be confirmed later by the review panel (or study \nchair). \n \nIn some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from \nnormal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this \ndetermination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine \nneedle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status. \n \nConfirmation \n \nIn the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met SD criteria at least once \nafter study entry at a minimum interval of six weeks.  \n \nEvaluation of Best Response to Study Treatment \n \nThe best response to study treatment (Table 10.4:3) is the best response recorded \nfrom the start of treatment until disease progression or start of further anti-cancer \ntreatment (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements \nrecorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient\u2019s best response \nassignment will depend on the achievement of both measurements and \nconfirmation criteria (Table 10.4:3). \n \nPatients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of \ntreatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be \nreported as \u201csymptomatic deterioration\u201d. Every effort should be made to document \nthe objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n104\n \n \n \nTable 10.4:3  Algorithm for evaluation of overall best response* \n \nTarget lesions \nNon-target lesions \nNew lesions \nOverall response \nCR \nCR \nNo \nCR \nCR \nNon-CR/ Non- PD \nNo \nPR \nCR \nNot evaluated \nNo \nPR \nPR \nNon-PD or not \nevaluated \nNo \nPR \nSD \nNon-PD or not \nevaluated \nNo \nSD \nNot evaluated \nNon-PD \nNo \nNE \nPD \nAny \nYes or No \nPD \nAny \nPD \nYes or No \nPD \nAny \nAny \nYes \nPD \n \n* In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a \nminimum \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n105\nTITLE PAGE \n \nABCD \nClinical Trial Protocol Amendment \nDoc.

These results also indicate that an effect \nof potent P-gp inducers on the PK characteristics of BIBW 2992 cannot be excluded. \nTo ensure continued subject safety, the following amendment have been made \nin the protocol: \n1.

Requirement for treatment with any of the prohibited concomitant medications listed in \nsection 4.2.2 \nReason For Change 1: \nDuring the consent process it is not known what medication the patient will be randomised to \nso it is necessary to have the exclusion criteria cover both arms of treatment. \nChange 2: \nAddition of explanatory paragraph (s) on restrictions regarding BIBW \n2992 treatment to section 4.2.2   \n4.2.2 Restrictions \n4.2.2.1 Restrictions for patients randomised to arm A (BIBW 2992) \nPatients randomised to treatment with BIBW 2992 should not receive any additional \nexperimental anti-cancer treatment, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone treatment (with \nthe exception of megestrol acetate) or radiotherapy (except palliative short-course \nradiotherapy to non-target lesions) between informed consent and the end of treatment visit. \n4.2.2.2 Restrictions for patients randomised to arm B (Gemcitabine/ Cisplatin \nchemotherapy) \n \nPatients randomised to treatment with Gemcitabine/ Cisplatin chemotherapy should not \nreceive any additional experimental anti-cancer treatment, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, \nhormone treatment (with the exception of megestrol acetate), maintenance therapy for \nNSCLC or radiotherapy (except palliative short-course radiotherapy to non-target lesions) \nbetween informed consent and the end of treatment visit. \nPatients should not receive any of the prohibited medications as listed in the current summary \nof product characteristics (SPC) for the Gemcitabine/ Cisplatin chemotherapy regimen. \nwas change to \n4.2.2 Restrictions \nAll patients randomised should not receive any additional experimental anti-cancer treatment, \nchemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone treatment (with the exception of megestrol acetate) \nor radiotherapy (except palliative short-course radiotherapy to non-target lesions) between \ninformed consent and the end of treatment visit. \nBoehringer Ingelheim \nFinal, 14 May 2010 \nBI Trial No.: 1200.34           Protocol amendment 1 \nPage 3 of 4 \n \nIn addition patients randomised to treatment with Gemcitabine/ Cisplatin chemotherapy \nshould not receive any maintenance therapy for NSCLC or receive any of the prohibited \nmedications as listed in the current summary of product characteristics (SPC) for the \nGemcitabine/ Cisplatin chemotherapy regimen. \nBIBW 2992 is a substrate of P-gp and its plasma concentrations can be affected by the use of \nP-gp inhibitors (data on file) and it is also likely that P-gp inducers could also influence \nBIBW 2992 plasma concentrations. The use of potent P-gp inhibitors (including Cyclosporin, \nErythromycin, Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Quinidine, Phenobarbital salt with Quinidine, \nRitonavir, Valspodar, Verapamil) and potent P-gp inducers (including St John's wort, \nrifampicin) must be avoided during treatment with BIBW 2992. Any exemptions to this must \nbe discussed with the BI clinical monitor. \nIn any patient ongoing in the trial receiving BIBW 2992 and a concomitant potent P-gp \ninhibitor or inducer at the time of amendment 1 being implemented, the decision for \ncontinuation of either drug will be based on the individual circumstances of the patient upon \ndiscussion with the responsible BI clinical monitor. \nReason For Change 2: \nThe restriction was added based on the results of a phase 1 trial 1200.79 performed in healthy \nvolunteers. Since BIBW 2992 is a P-gp substrate, BI performed this trial to assess the effects \nof the potent P-gp inhibitor ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIBW 2992. \nIn this open-label, randomised, two-way crossover study the relative exposure after a single \noral dose of BIBW 2992 (20 mg), co-administered with multiple oral doses of ritonavir (200 \nmg bid for 3 days), was compared to the exposure after a single oral dose of BIBW 2992 (20 \nmg) alone in healthy male volunteers. The study was designed to determine the maximum \neffect of P-gp inhibition on the PK of BIBW 2992. \nThe initial results of the study show that, although the median tmax and terminal half-life of \nBIBW 2992 were not affected, the rate and extent of absorption of BIBW 2992 was increased \nby co-treatment with ritonavir. The exposure to BIBW 2992, when taken in combination with \nritonavir (AUC0-\u221e, AUC0-tz and Cmax), increased by 50.0%, 47.6%, and 38.5%, respectively \n(Data on file). \nThese results also indicate that an effect of potent P-gp inducers on the PK characteristics of \nBIBW 2992 cannot be excluded. \nThe data in trial 1200.79 were obtained at a dose of 20 mg BIBW 2992. It is currently unclear \nwhether the results can be extrapolated to higher doses of BIBW 2992 currently used in phase \nII/III trials. However, considering the dose dependence of adverse events and for safety \nreasons caution has to be exercised in combining BIBW 2992 with potent P-gp inhibitors and \ninducers. \nIn addition guidance for management of patients who already receive BIBW 2992 in \ncombination with Pgp-inhibitors and Pgp-inducers was provided, as in these patients careful \nBoehringer Ingelheim \nFinal, 14 May 2010 \nBI Trial No.: 1200.34           Protocol amendment 1 \nPage 4 of 4 \n \nrisk-benefit assessment of the individual case may need to be performed upon discussion with \nthe responsible BI clinical monitor. \nThis is reflected by the modification of an exclusion criterion to all ongoing trials (Change 1), \nand the addition of restrictions for concomitant medications to be given together with BIBW \n2992 ( Change 2). \n",

million new cases diagnosed and 880,000 deaths each year. The prognosis for \nadvanced Stage disease has not changed significantly in the past 20 years. With an overall 5- \nyear survival rate of only 15%, the treatment of this disease remains a major clinical \nchallenge (R05-0876). \n \nIn patients with advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIB pleural effusion or Stage IV metastatic \ndisease) systemic chemotherapy is considered the first line treatment of choice, prolonging \nthe median survival and palliating tumour-related symptoms (R05-0876). In an Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial, platinum-based doublets achieved an objective \nresponse in approximately 20% of advanced NSCLC patients and prolonged median survival \nto 7.9 months with a one-year survival rate of 33% and a two-year survival rate of 11% (R04-\n1314). Currently, several different platinum-based doublet combinations are in use worldwide \nas historically there has been no globally recognised superior regimen.  \n \nWhile systemic chemotherapy has demonstrated modest activity in advanced NSCLC, novel \ntargeted therapies based on specific molecular and biological characteristics of lung cancer \nhave emerged as a new treatment paradigm. The targets most extensively studied include the \nepidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) or the Subclass I of the superfamily of \ntransmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (R06-1302, R07-1049, R07-1135). The Epidermal \nGrowth Factor Receptor was the first member to be cloned and is the most biologically \nrelevant receptor for NSCLC. The erbB signaling system now comprises four closely related \ntyrosine kinase receptors: human epidermal growth factor receptor 1, HER 1 (erbB1/EGFR), \nHER2 (erbB2), HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4) (R06-1301, R06-1302). Growth factors, \nsuch as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), bind to \nEGFR and trigger the dimerisation of two EGFR molecules or the heterodimerisation with \nother closely related receptors, such as HER2. Autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation \nof the EGFR through its tyrosine kinase domain leads to the recruitment of downstream \neffector molecules and the activation of multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways. \nActivation of these signalling cascades is essential for controlling malignant cell growth and \nmetastasis (R06-1262, R06-1301, R06-1302). \n \nAberrant activation of EGFR is frequently observed in a variety of malignant tumours and \ncan be caused by different molecular mechanisms including mutations, receptor over-\nexpression, ligand-dependent receptor dimerisation, and ligand-independent activation. Over-\nexpression of EGFR is detected in 40% to 80% of NSCLC and this has led to the \ndevelopment of specific small molecule EGFR antagonists (R06-1301, R06-1393, R06- \n1394). First-generation EGFR small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) act as ATP \nanalogues, competing reversibly for the tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic site, and include \ngefitinib (Iressa\u00ae) and erlotinib (Tarceva\u00ae). \n \nDespite the high levels of EGFR over-expression in tumours in the majority of patients with \nNSCLC, recent clinical experiences with specific EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n16\ndemonstrated tumour regression in only 10% to 15% of unselected NSCLC patients (R05- \n0867, R06-1301, R06-1306). Further analysis has demonstrated that an objective tumour \nresponse to TKI therapy is more likely to occur in Asian females with adenocarcinomas \n(often with bronchoalveolar differentiation) and with a history of modest or no cigarette \nsmoking (R06-1259, R06-1306, R06-1395, R07-1049). \n \nFurther investigations in patients who respond to TKI therapy have indicated that the \nsensitivity to therapy may correlate with the presence of EGFR activating mutations. \nSequence analysis of tissue samples from NSCLC patients responsive to TKI therapy \nrevealed approximately 30 different somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of \nEGFR (R06-1262, R06-1393). The frequency of EGFR somatic mutations in the general \nNSCLC population was found to be approximately 10% in patients from the US, Europe or \nAustralia and up to 30% in patients from Japan and Taiwan (R06-1262, R06-1306, R06- \n1393). \n \nSpecific mutations sensitising EGFR to TKI therapy are either short, in-frame nucleotide \ndeletions, in-frame duplications/insertions or single-nucleotide substitutions clustered around \nthe region of the ATP binding-pocket of the receptor tyrosine kinase domain (R04-4507, \nR06-1311, R07-1134, R07-1135). The two most common mutations, accounting for more \nthan 90% of known sensitising EGFR mutations in NSCLC specimens result in an in-frame \ndeletion, including the amino acids at codons 746 to 750 (E746 to A750) in Exon 19 and a \npoint mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution at codon 858 (L858R) in Exon 21 \n(R04-4507, R06-1311, R06-1393, R07-1134, R07-1135). Structural analysis has revealed that \nthese mutations lead to a conformational change within the kinase domain, narrowing of the \nATP binding cleft and result in enhanced ligand-dependent receptor activation (R06-1264). In \naddition, these mutations result in stabilisation of both ATP and competitive small molecule \ninhibitors within the binding pocket. \n \nRetrospective analyses of studies have indicated that patients with activating Exon 19 and \nExon 21 EGFR mutations have a higher response rate and a prolonged survival following \ntreatment with single-agent TKIs compared to patients with wild-type EGFR (R06-1306, \nR06-1311, R06-1406, R08-4128). Several prospective phase II studies have investigated \nfurther the use of TKIs in patients harbouring EGFR mutations (R06-1310, R06-1458, R06- \n1459, R08-4048, R08-4078, R08-4049). The median PFS observed in these studies ranged \nfrom 8.9 months to 12 months, with response rates of between 55% and 90%. Overall \nsurvival of up to 24 months has been observed in patients with EGFR mutations receiving \ncustomised treatment (R08-4049). The largest cumulative series to date is a combined \nanalysis from seven trials of first-line gefitinib monotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations \n(R08-4050). This analysis included 148 patients and demonstrated a PFS of 9.7 months and a \nresponse rate of 76.4%. \n \nThe IPASS trial is a phase III randomized trial of gefitinib versus carboplatin/paclitaxel \nchemotherapy as first-line treatment for Asian patients selected based on demographic \nfeatures associated with a higher frequency of mutations (adenocarcinoma, never or light \nexsmokers) (R08-4132). Recently presented data from this trial indicated that the median \nprogression-free survival (PFS) was equivalent in the two treatment arms (5.7 months with \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n17\ngefitinib versus 5.8 months with carboplatin/ paclitaxel) (R09-4437). A subgroup of the \noverall population was tested for EGFR mutation status and an analysis was performed on \nthis subgroup. Amongst the patients tested, the rate of mutation observed was 60%. Patients \nwho tested positive for EGFR mutation had a significantly higher response rate when treated \nwith gefitinib (71.2%) compared to treatment with carboplatin/ paclitaxel (47.3%). Patients \nwho tested negative for EGFR mutation had a significantly higher response rate when treated \nwith carboplatin/ paclitaxel (23.5%) compared to treatment with gefitinib (1.1%). Similarly \nwhen compared to chemotherapy, PFS was significantly longer in the presence of EGFR \nmutations (HR=0.48) and significantly shorter in the absence of EGFR mutations (HR=2.85) \nin the gefitinib arm. These results strongly suggest that the use of single agent TKIs for first-\nline therapy may only be of value in patients with EGFR mutations but that in this group of \npatients, treatment with single-agent TKIs may be more beneficial than chemotherapy. \n \nThe efficacy of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations depends on the type \nof mutation. Patients with one of the two most common mutations, Exon 19 deletions and \nL858R, have the highest response rates (84.2%) whereas patients with other, less common, \nmutations have lower response rates of less than 20% (R08-4109). \n \nIn trial 1200.34, patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR mutation will \nbe randomized to receive either Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy or the irreversible \nEGFR small molecule inhibitor BIBW 2992. \n \nBIBW 2992 is a member of the second generation of TKIs which bind irreversibly to EGFR \nand HER2 and are thought to have potential benefit over first generation TKIs such as \nerlotinib and gefitinib. One of the reasons for the potential benefit is that BIBW 2992 may \nhave activity against mutations which are resistant to the first generation TKIs (U03-3218). \nAdditionally the irreversible binding may confer more prolonged activity further delaying \ntumour progression when compared to reversible TKIs. \n \nDespite initially promising responses, most patients treated with currently available \nEGFRTKI therapies will eventually develop disease progression. Molecular analyses of \nrelapsed NSCLC samples from this group of patients have demonstrated an EGFR mutation \nrendering the tumour cells resistant to EGFR-TKI therapy (R06-1263, R06-1264, R06-1265, \nR06-1266, R06-1393). This specific mutation in Exon 20 causes a single base pair change \nleading to a threonine to methionine amino acid alteration in position 790 (T790M). This \nspecific threonine residue at position 790 serves as the \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 deep in the catalytic \nATP-binding site of the kinase domain. The bulkier methionine side chain confers drug \nresistance to the tumour cells by sterically hindering the access of TKIs such as erlotinib or \ngefitinib to the ATP binding site (R06-1264). \n \nStudies of tumour biopsies taken at diagnosis have shown that the T790M is rarely detected \nprior to treatment with EGFR TKIs (R06-1405). However, a recent study of EGFR mutations \nin circulating tumour cells detected the T790M mutation in 38% of patients prior to \ncommencing treatment (R08-4065). The authors also observed that the T790M mutation was \npresent at a relatively low frequency, suggesting that it is present in only a sub-clone of cells \nand may not be detected by conventional techniques. Following treatment with TKIs, the \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n18\nT790M mutation is detectable in approximately 50% of NSCLC with acquired resistance to \nerlotinib and gefitinib (R06-1264). \n \nOne of the proposed strategies to prevent or overcome the acquired resistance to TKI therapy \nin malignant tumours is the use of small molecule inhibitors with higher binding affinity, i.e., \nirreversible kinase inhibitors (R06-1263, R06-1389, R06-1390, R06-1391, R07-1135, R07- \n1162). Recently published experimental data strongly support this strategy (R06-1307). \nBronchioloalveolar NCI-H1650 NSCLC cells in vitro rapidly developed resistance to \ngefitinib but not to the irreversible EGFR inhibitors HKI-357, HKI-272, and EKB-569. \nMoreover, stable over-expression of T790M mutant EGFR conferred high-level biochemical \nresistance to the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib in Ba/F3 murine hematopoietic \nprogenitor cells that remain sensitive to the irreversible EGFR small molecule inhibitor CL-\n367,785 (R06-1390). BIBW 2992 also belongs to this class of irreversible kinase inhibitors \nand has recently shown in vitro activity against NIH-3T3 cell lines expressing the T790M \nmutation (P08-06904). BIBW 2992 also demonstrated activity in xenograft and transgenic \nlung cancer models expressing the T790M mutation. In the same experiment these xenografts \nwere resistant to lapatinib and gefitinib (P08-06904). \n \nThese preclinical data support the hypothesis that BIBW 2992 may be more efficacious in the \ntreatment of tumours harbouring EGFR mutations than the currently available TKIs. \n \n1.2 \nDRUG PROFILE \nBIBW 2992 is a highly selective and potent low molecular weight, irreversible inhibitor of \nthe erbB-family of tyrosine kinase receptors EGFR (erbB1 / HER1) and HER 2 (erbB2). All \nreferences in this protocol concerning BIBW 2992 refer to the oral formulation (U03-3218). \n \nThe potency of BIBW 2992 was determined in enzymatic assays using recombinant human \nwild-type EGFR (IC50 0.5 nM) and HER2 (IC50 14 nm) (U03-3218). A panel of \nrecombinant human kinases tested in parallel was not inhibited, demonstrating the high target \nspecificity of BIBW 2992 (U03-3218). Molecular modeling revealed that BIBW 2992 binds \ncovalently and with high affinity to Cys773 within the catalytic cleft of the ATP-binding \npocket of the EGF receptor. It has been reported that this specific molecular interaction \nresults in irreversible inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (R02-2292). \nExperimental data from in vitro washout studies confirmed the irreversible binding of BIBW \n2992 to its molecular target. In constitutively EGFR-overexpressing A431 human epidermoid \ncancer cells, BIBW 2992 inhibition of EGFR-signaling lasted for up to 7 hours after removal \nof the compound from the cell cultures (U03-3218). In contrast, A431 cells exposed to \nreversible EGFR TKIs regained full receptor function almost immediately after inhibitor \nwashout. \n \nThe specific activity of BIBW 2992 was determined in two independent in vitro assay \nsystems: i) EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation using immunoprecipitation and Western \nblot and ii) clonogenic, anchorage-independent cell growth in a soft-agar assay system (P07- \n02467). The antiproliferative effects observed with BIBW 2992 compare favourably to \nactivity data published for gefitinib in the same NSCLC cell models (R06-1388). In addition, \nBIBW 2992 suppressed EGFR phosphorylation and clonogenic growth in the gefitinib-\n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n19\nresistant NCI-H1975 model, suggesting that tumour cells harboring the T790M EGFR TKI \nresistance mutation remain sensitive to this irreversible EGFR small molecule inhibitor (R06-\n1391). \n \nThe in vivo activity of BIBW 2992 against EGFR was investigated in an A431 subcutaneous \nxenograft model (U03-3218). Daily oral treatment with BIBW 2992 at doses of 20 mg/kg \nresulted in an almost complete inhibition of tumour growth over a period of 25 days. Similar \nanti-tumour activity was observed in NCI-N87 tumour bearing mice treated with BIBW 2992 \nat similar concentrations. In these in vivo studies, BIBW 2992 plasma concentrations of 80- \n285 nM corresponding to an AUC0-24 of 589-3198 nM*h were required for anti-tumour \nactivity. All BIBW 2992 doses shown to be effective in mouse xenograft models were well \ntolerated. \n \nPharmacology and toxicology profile \n \nThe absolute bioavailability of BIBW 2992 after oral ingestion is 45% in rats with a median \ntmax reached after 4 hours and a terminal half-life (t1/2) of 4.5 hours. In rats the exposure was \ndose proportional and no gender-related effects or compound accumulation was observed. \nBIBW 2992 is primarily excreted via the faeces. No relevant inhibition of cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes was found. In vitro BIBW 2992 is however a CYP3A4 substrate (U05-1723-01). \nSince this is not considered a dominant metabolic pathway, in vitro drug-drug interactions \nwith CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors are not expected (U03-3218). In vivo BIBW 2992 was \nmetabolised only to a minor extent and the metabolism was governed by adduct formation to \nproteins or nucleophilic small molecules. It was found that metabolism is of subordinate role \nfor BIBW 2992 and that enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions play a negligible role for the \nmetabolism of BIBW 2992 in vivo. Only approx. 2 % of the dose were metabolised by FMO3 \nin vivo. The CYP3A4-dependent N-demethylation was even too low to be quantitatively \ndetected in human volunteers (U07-1737, U06-2055- 01, U07-1296-01). Therefore, intrinsic \n(e.g. genetic predisposition) or extrinsic (e.g. by comedications) effects on the activity of \nFMO3 or CYP3A4 in vivo are expected to be of little, if any, relevance for the \npharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992. The human ADME data confirmed the results of the \npreclinical [14C] ADME studies and all metabolites of the human  [14C] ADME study were \nobserved in the rat or the minipig (See U04-1028 and U06-1093, respectively). \n \nIn acute toxicology studies, oral administration of single doses in rats and mice indicated a \nlow acute toxic potential of BIBW 2992. Changes in renal and hepatic function occurred only \nat doses that were 10-30 fold above the levels required for antitumour activity. BIBW 2992 \nhad effects on gastrointestinal function that were dose-dependent and in high doses, leading \nto profound inhibition. No acute toxic effects on the central nervous system were detected. In \noral repeated dose studies for up to 26 weeks in rats and minipigs, the main target organs \nwere the gastrointestinal tract (rats and minipigs), kidneys (rat), and the skin (rats). In the \ngastrointestinal tract, increasing systemic exposure was associated with dose-dependent \natrophy of the epithelium and concomitant focal erosions/ulcerations in the stomach of rats \nand minipigs. In rat kidneys papillary necrosis and dilated tubules were found. Cutaneous \nalterations, i.e., epithelial atrophy were observed in rats. However, BIBW 2992 is not \nirritating to intact skin in albino rabbits and the effects observed in rats are most likely related \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n20\nto the specific pharmacodynamic mechanism of EGFR-inhibition (U03-3218). A variety of \norgans including the aerodigestive tract and reproductive organs were affected by epithelial \natrophy. These atrophic changes were not severe and fully reversed during a 2-week recovery \nperiod. Minor cardiovascular effects (increased blood pressure and heart rate) and a dose-\ndependent decrease of QT time in the electrocardiogram (ECG) occurred in BIBW 2992-\ntreated minipigs. These data do not indicate a risk for QT-prolongation related arrhythmia. \nBIBW 2992 had no pro-arrhythmic potential. BIBW 2992 demonstrated mutagenic potential \nin bacteria but had no genotoxic potential in vivo even at highly toxic/lethal doses in animals. \nBecause of its specific pharmacodynamic mechanism of action, BIBW 2992 is potentially \nembryo/ foetotoxic and/or teratogenic. \n \nBIBW 2992 Phase I and Phase II trial program \n \nThe most up to date trial and safety information can be found in the current version of the \nInvestigator Brochure (U03-3218). \n \nBIBW 2992 showed moderately fast absorption with median tmax values between 1 h to 6 h \nafter administration. The gMean terminal half-life (t1/2) of BIBW 2992 mainly ranged \nbetween 13 h to 57 h. In general, the maximum blood concentration (Cmax) and the integral of \nthe concentration time curve (AUC) of BIBW 2992 increased in a dose-proportional way \n(U03-3218). \n \nThe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIBW 2992 was identified as 50 mg once daily in \nphase I continuous dosing monotherapy trials. The 50mg dose is currently used in the phase \nIIb/III trial 1200.23 in NSCLC patients progressing on erlotinib or gefitinib, as maximum \nEGFR inhibition is required in this last-line population enriched for the presence of resistance \nmutations. For a more sensitive population with EGFR activating mutation, a starting dose of \n40mg is expected to be sufficient. In phase I clinical trials of BIBW 2992, durable responses \n(>20 months) were seen at daily doses of 40mg and less. \n \nIn this trial, a starting dose of 40 mg will be used in order to optimize the efficacy/toxicity \nbalance in the very sensitive population of first-line patients with EGFR activating mutations. \nVariability is expected in the incidence and severity of adverse events and to ensure \nmaximum EGFR inhibition, dose escalation to 50mg will be allowed after the first course of \ntreatment (21 days) in patients with minimal treatment-related adverse events. An interim \nanalysis based on response rate is planned to allow an early assessment of the efficacy of the \nstarting dose of 40mg (see Section 7.3.4). \n \nThe Adverse Events (AEs) observed to date in Phase I and Phase II trials are consistent with \nthose reported for other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dose dependent diarrhoea and skin \nrelated adverse events including rash and acne). Other AEs were in the expected range for \npatients with advanced cancer disease (U03-3218). In the BIBW 2992 Phase I monotherapy \ntrials, the most frequent drug-related adverse events were associated with gastrointestinal \ndisorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n(rash, dry skin, pruritus, acneiform rash, and acne), general disorders and administration site \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n21\nconditions (fatigue, mucosal inflammation), respiratory disorders (epistaxis, typically grade \n1), and metabolism and nutritional disorders (anorexia, dehydration). \n \nDiarrhoea is the single most often reported gastrointestinal AE. An increased incidence of \ndiarrhoea grade 3 (22.4%) has been observed in phase II monotherapy trials (starting dose of \n50 mg qd). Prompt and proactive management of diarrhoea together with timely treatment \npause and dose reduction is crucial to reduce the severity of diarrhoea and its potential \ncomplications such as dehydration leading to serum electrolyte changes (hyponatraemia, \nhypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia) and/or renal impairment.  \n \nNausea and vomiting are the other commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events and \ncan be generally managed successfully with the use of antiemetics.  \n \nSkin related adverse events present in a number of forms, i.e., rash (including erythematous, \nmaculo-papular, papular, etc.), acne, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, skin reaction and \npruritis. Folliculitis as well as nail changes (including paronychia) are other reported \nmanifestations of skin-related adverse events with BIBW 2992. Early and adequate \nmanagement of skin-related adverse events can reduce the frequency and the severity of them \n(R07-4077). \n \nFurther AEs included oral discomfort (stomatitis, mouth ulceration, oral pain, dry mouth) soft \ntissue disorder) and mucosal inflammation. Conjunctivitis and rhinorrhoea as a result of \ninflammation in the mucosal membranes have been reported. Mucosal and skin dryness can \nlead to epistaxis, which has always been observed at CTCAE Grade 1. Anorexia, fatigue and \nasthenia are also frequently observed. \n \nOf 22 evaluable patients with NSCLC from Phase I trials, there have been four partial \nresponses (PRs) (3 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed PR) ranging in duration from 5 months to \n24 months. All 4 patients were non-smoking Caucasian with adenocarcinoma of the lung. In \ntwo of these three patients with confirmed PR, EGFR sequencing has shown Exon 19 inframe \ndeletions. These preliminary clinical efficacy data suggest that BIBW 2992 may be \nefficacious in patients with recurrent NSCLC harbouring sensitising EGFR mutations. \n \nThe efficacy and safety of BIBW 2992 in NSCLC is being evaluated in a phase II trial. In this \ntrial, patients with Stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation in exons 18-21 \nand failure of one line of systemic chemotherapy are treated with BIBW 2992 at a dose of \n50mg once daily until disease progression. Preliminary results of 67 patients  treated in the \n2nd line setting have shown tumour size reductions in the majority of patients with disease \ncontrol rate of 97%  and overall response rate of 66%. After amending and allowing first line \npatients into the trial preliminary data show an overall response rate of 63% and a disease \ncontrol rate of 97% of patients in a total of 38 first line patients  Diarrhoea (83.3%) and skin-\nrelated adverse events (87.4%) have been the main side effects but have been manageable \nwith appropriate dose interruption/reduction (P08-07355).  \n \nA global, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind phase IIB/III trial (LUX-Lung 1) is \ncurrently ongoing and is assessing the efficacy of BIBW 2992 plus best supportive care \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n22\n(BSC) when compared to placebo plus BSC in non-small cell lung cancer patients failing \nerlotinib or gefitinib. Based on the planned interim analysis of safety and efficacy described \nin the protocol, the independent DMC has allowed for continuation of recruitment in the trial. \n \n1.3 \nRATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL \nThe introduction of the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib has changed the clinical \nmanagement of patients with advanced NSCLC (R06-1394, R06-1307, R07-1049, R07-\n1134). For the first time, a significant clinical benefit may be achieved by a treatment that \ncontrols NSCLC progression with acceptable levels of side effects through a defined and \nspecific, targeted molecular mechanism (R06-1394). \n \nPatients with adenocarcinoma who have an EGFR mutation have a particularly significant \nbenefit from treatment with TKIs (R08-5155). In these patients the objective response rates \nachieved with TKI therapy are superior to those obtained with chemotherapy. BIBW 2992 is \na second generation irreversible EGFR-TKI (R07-1135, R07-1162) which may have \nimproved potency when compared to erlotinib and gefitinib. BIBW 2992 may also prevent \nthe emergence of the T790M resistance mutation which is commonly seen in patients \nrelapsing after gefinitib or erlotinib. The preliminary results of a second-line study performed \nin EGFR mutation positive patients show a disease control rate of 87.5% with BIBW 2992 \n(P08-07355). These promising data support the conduct of a phase III trial with BIBW 2992 \nin patients with EGFR mutations. \n \nIn this trial eligible patients will be randomized (2:1) into two treatment arms to receive \neither (Arm A) BIBW 2992 or (Arm B) Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy. \n \nIn the comparator arm of this trial, bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy will not be \nincluded. Two recently reported randomized Phase III studies in the first line treatment of \nNSCLC, indicated that the addition of bevacizumab to standard paclitaxel and carboplatin \n(E4599) or gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy (B017704) increased the progression free \nsurvival from 4.8 to 6.4 months (R07-1161) and 6.1 to 6.7 months (R08-0542) respectively. \nBut in the AVAIL trial no significant difference in overall survival was observed. Based on \nthis data, and the restrictions on its use, bevacizumab is currently not widely used worldwide \nas standard first-line treatment for NSCLC and will not be included in the comparator arm of \nthis trial.  \n \nEfficacy will be assessed by measuring progression-free survival according to RECIST 1.1 \ncriteria (R09-0262), while safety will be analysed using the Common Terminology Criteria \nfor Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 (R04-0474). In addition to evaluating treatment \nefficacy and safety, the study will also assess health-related quality of life and \npharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n23\n1.4 \nBENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT \nThe outcome for patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC is poor, with an overall 5-year \nsurvival rate of only 15%. In recent years tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to \ntarget the molecular pathways involved in tumour growth. There is now evidence that these \nagents are effective in NSCLC patients and particularly in the subgroup of patients whose \ntumours harbour mutations in the EGFR gene (R08-5155). \n \nThe currently available preclinical data indicate that BIBW 2992 is potentially superior to \nreversible EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib) (P08-06904). The preliminary clinical data from \ntrial 1200.22 supports this (P08-07355). The results of first-line treatment with EGFR TKIs \ncompare favourably with historical controls. However, only prospective and controlled \nclinical trials can establish these treatments as a new standard. The objective of this trial is to \nassess whether a targeted treatment for a targeted population can be identified, providing \nmaximum benefit to the enriched population, whilst sparing those patients who are not likely \nto benefit. \n \nBased on the toxicology findings and the experiences from the phase I and II studies, a \ncontinuous oral daily dose of 40mg BIBW 2992, together with proactive management of \ncommon side effects and the proposed dose reduction scheme, will be well tolerated. The \nmost common side effects are expected to be primarily gastrointestinal (including diarrhoea, \nnausea, vomiting and anorexia) as well as fatigue and rash. As an oral drug BIBW 2992 will \nbe a much more convenient treatment for patients when compared to chemotherapy and the \nside effect profile is expected to be in favour of BIBW 2992. Although skin and \ngastrointestinal adverse events are common with BIBW 2992, they are rarely serious and \nalmost always reversible, whereas chemotherapy is associated with potentially life-\nthreatening side effects as a result of bone marrow suppression as well as potential \nirreversible side effects. \n \nRegular and frequent assessment of clinical benefit (including early imaging with first \nradiological tumour assessment after 6 weeks of treatment) throughout Study 1200.34 will \nensure that any patient not deriving clinical benefit will be withdrawn from the trial \ntreatment. Furthermore an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will oversee the study \nand will advise on the further conduct of the trial based on the ongoing assessment of efficacy \nand safety data. \n \nConsidering the poor outcome in this group of patients and the need for the development of \nspecific treatments with less side effects, it is expected that the benefits of first-line therapy \nwith BIBW 2992 will outweigh the risks. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n24\n2. \nTRIAL OBJECTIVES \n2.1 \nGENERAL AIM - OBJECTIVES \nThis randomized, open label phase III trial will be performed in patients with \nadenocarcinoma of the lung with tumours harbouring an EGFR activating mutation.

The primary endpoint of the trial will be \nprogression free survival in all randomized patients.  \n \nThe trial will be performed by investigators specialised in the treatment of lung cancer in \nAsia countries (China, India and Korea). It is estimated that approximately 1366 patients will \nbe screened for the trial in order to find 330 eligible patients.  \n \nAll patients will be required to provide a tumour biopsy sample at screening for EGFR \nmutation testing, which will be performed by a central laboratory. \n \nEligible patients will be randomized (2:1) to receive either single agent BIBW 2992 (Arm A) \nor chemotherapy with Gemcitabine/Cisplatin (Arm B). \n \nIn Arm A (BIBW 2992) 220 patients will receive continuous daily treatment with BIBW \n2992 until progression, unacceptable adverse events or other reason necessitating withdrawal \n(see Section 6.3.1). The treatment will be administered as courses of 21 days. The starting \ndose of BIBW 2992 will be 40 mg once daily. In the event of no or minimal drug-related \nadverse events after one course of treatment, the dose will be increased to 50 mg (see Section \n4.1.4.1 for details). As detailed in Section 4.1.4.1.1, dose reduction will occur in the event of \ncertain drug-related adverse events. Dose reduction will be in increments of 10 mg, with the \nlowest dose being 20mg. Patients receiving 20 mg will be withdrawn from treatment if a \ndrug-related grade 3 adverse event occurs. Regardless of the dose taken, a patient will be \nwithdrawn from treatment if certain drug related events persist for more than 14 days despite \nstopping treatment (see Section 4.1.4.1.1), and then followed up as described in Section 6.1.4. \n \nA limited pharmacokinetic sampling approach will be carried out for patients in arm A \n(BIBW 2992) - only trough PK samples will be taken (refer to Section 5.5). \n \nIn arm B (chemotherapy) 110 patients will receive Gemcitabine (1000 mg /m2) on day 1 and \nday 8, Cisplatin (75 mg /m2) on day 1 of each course. Patients will receive 6 courses of 3 \nweeks of treatment unless unacceptable side effects prevent this. All patients who receive at \nleast one dose of treatment will be followed every 3 weeks after ending treatment until \nprogression or other reason necessitating withdrawal (see Section 6.3.1). Dose reduction will \noccur in the event of certain adverse events (see Section 4.1.4.2). \n \nAppendix 1 provides an overview of the trial design. \n \nAll patients will visit the investigator at regular intervals for assessment of safety parameters \nand adverse events as outlined in the flow chart. Assessments of response will be made at 6 \nweeks, 12 weeks and every 6 weeks thereafter until progression or withdrawal for another \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n26\nreason. After week 48, assessment of response will be performed every 12 weeks until \nprogression of withdrawal for another reason. Tumour response and progression will be \nassessed using RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262) and assessment at the investigator site will be \nsufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. An independent analysis of response \nwill also be performed by a Central Imaging Unit (see Section 5.1.4) but this will not be used \nto make treatment decisions. \n \nBIBW 2992, Gemcitabine and Cisplatin will be provided to the study sites by Boehringer \nIngelheim and will be stored according to the specified conditions (see Section 4.1.7). \n \nAll trial relevant documentation will be stored in the clinical trial master file (CTMF) at \nBoehringer Ingelheim. In addition each site will have an Investigator Site File (ISF) \ncontaining all trial documents relevant for the site. \n \nThe coordinating investigators are investigators participating in the trial who have experience \nof this type of trial and investigations. The coordinating investigators have been designated \nby Boehringer Ingelheim and will sign the clinical trial report. \n \n3.2 \nDISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF \nCONTROL GROUP(S) \nThe primary objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy of BIBW 2992 to chemotherapy \nin patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring an EGFR activating mutation. \nPatients will be randomized to receive either BIBW 2992 or chemotherapy with \nGemcitabine/Cisplatin. Due to the inherent differences between the two treatment arms, the \ntrial will be open-label. \n \nThe primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival and therefore the patients will \nbe followed until progression. \n \n3.3 \nSELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION \nA log of all patients who have signed the informed consent form will be maintained in the \nISF at the investigational site. The trial will be conducted in multiple centres in Asia (China, \nIndia and Korea). It is estimated that approximately 1366 patients will be screened in order to \nrecruit 330 eligible patients. \n \nAdditional centres may be opened in the event of slower than expected recruitment and \nunderperforming centres may be closed. Recruitment rates will vary between centres but it is \nexpected that 36 patients per month will be randomized into the trial over a period of 9-10 \nmonths recruitment. \n3.3.1 \nInclusion criteria \nPatients are eligible for inclusion (enrolment) if they fulfill the following criteria: \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n27\n1.

The randomization will be stratified according to the type of \nmutation present. Details of stratification can be found in Section 7.5.  \n \nRandomization will be carried out centrally using an Interactive Voice/Web Response \nSystem (IVRS/IWRS). The company that provides the IVRS/IWRS system will receive the \nrandomization list from Boehringer Ingelheim Clinical Trial Support Group or a CRO \nappointed by the sponsor. The BI standard validated random number generating system will \nbe used to generate the randomization schedules which will be verified by an independent \nstatistician who is not involved in the study. The access to the randomization code will be \nsupervised by the Clinical Trial Support Group and persons directly involved in the conduct \nand analysis of the trial will have no access to the randomization schedule. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n31\n4.1.3 \nSelection of doses in the trial \nArm A:  \nThe starting dose for BIBW 2992 continuous dosing is 40 mg. \n \nArm B:  \nStandard chemotherapy with;  \nGemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 followed by Cisplatin 75 mg/ m2  \n \nThese doses have been chosen according to the published information for these drugs. \n \n4.1.4 \nSelection and timing of doses for each patient \n4.1.4.1 BIBW 2992 (Arm A) \nFor administrative purposes treatment will be divided into treatment courses, which are each \n3 weeks (21 days) in duration. Patients will take a single oral dose of 40mg BIBW 2992 each \nday for the first course (21 days). \n \nIf the patient experiences \u2265 Grade 1 diarrhoea, skin-related adverse events or mucositis or \nany drug-related event \u2265 Grade 2 during the first course, the dose of BIBW 2992 should be \ncontinued at 40mg (unless dose reduction is necessary - see Section 4.1.4.1.1). \n \nIf none of the above events are experienced during the first course of treatment, the dose for \nCourse 2 should be increased to 50 mg. The patient should remain on 50 mg for subsequent \ntreatment courses, unless dose reduction is necessary (see Section 4.1.4.1.1). Any exceptions \nto this will be decided by the Boehringer Ingelheim clinical monitor in agreement with the \ninvestigator. \n  \nDose escalation is prohibited in any situation other than that described above. \n \nThe medication should be taken at the same time each day (\u00b1 2 hours) at least one hour \nbefore food intake and at least three hours after food intake. The tablet should be swallowed \nwith a glass of water. BIBW 2992 tablets are film-coated and therefore should not be chewed \nor crushed, but may be administered via G-tube after dispersing the BIBW 2992 tablets \naccording to the following procedure: Place the tablet into a glass containing 50 mL isotonic \nsodium chloride solution. Stir until the tablet is broken up into very fine particles (about 15 \nminutes). Drink the suspension immediately or administer via a gastric tube. Rinse the glass \nwith another 50 ml of isotonic sodium chloride solution and drink or administer the \nsupplementary solution via the gastric-tube again (to pick up any drug remaining in the \nglass/gastric-tube). \n \nPharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on Day 1 and Day 8 of Course 2 and on Day 1 \nof Course 3. On these days patients should not take the trial medication and should not eat for \nat least three hours prior to their visit to the study site. If a patient needs to eat within 3 hours \nof a scheduled visit, tablets should be taken as usual and the time of food intake noted on the \nCRF. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n32\n4.1.4.1.1 \nDose reduction scheme for BIBW 2992 \n \nIn the event of treatment-related toxicities, the treatment with BIBW 2992 should be handled \naccording to the schedule in Table 4.1.4.1.1:1 \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n33\nTable 4.1.4.1.1:1 Dose reduction scheme \n \nAE type and grade \nAction Dose \nDose reduction \nscheme\nEvents related to study drug; \n\u2022 Any drug related AE CTCAE \nGrade \u22653. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade \u22652 diarrhoea \npersisting for 2 or more \nconsecutive days (48 hours) \ndespite adequate anti-diarrhoeal \nmedication/ hydration. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade \u22652 nausea and/or \nvomiting persisting for 7 or more \nconsecutive days despite \nantiemetic treatment/ hydration. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade \u22652 worsening of \nrenal function as measured by \nserum creatinine, newly developed \nproteinuria, or newly developed \ndecrease in glomerular filtration \nrate of more than 50% from \nbaseline. \nPause treatment with BIBW \n2992 until patient has \nrecovered to CTCAE Grade \u2264 \n1 or baseline1. \n \nResume treatment at reduced \ndose according to schedule \nopposite.

A compliance check should be performed on day 8 \nof course 1 to ensure that the medication is being taken correctly. Subsequently, at the end of \neach course of treatment the patient should bring all remaining medication to the site and a \ncompliance check should be performed. Discrepancies between the number of tablets \nremaining and the calculated number of tablets that the patient should have taken should be \ndocumented and explained. At the end of each course any remaining medication should be \ncollected. If the patient is eligible for a further course of treatment a new bottle should be \ndispensed. \n \nPatients experiencing emesis should not take a replacement dose. BIBW 2992 should not be \ntaken more than once a day under any circumstances. \n \n4.3.2 \nGemcitabine/Cisplatin Chemotherapy (Arm B) \nChemotherapy will be administered at the trial site under the supervision of the investigator. \n \nIn the event that the patient does not receive the full dose of chemotherapy this should be \ndocumented and a reason given. \n. \n4.4 \nMANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS \n4.4.1 Management of diarrhoea following treatment with BIBW 2992 (Arm A) \nClose monitoring and proactive management of diarrhoea is essential for successful treatment \nof patients with BIBW 2992. Early and appropriate intervention can prevent the development \nof more severe diarrhoea. In most cases, loperamide controls diarrhoea caused by BIBW \n2992. Loperamide should be available at the start of therapy and kept with the patient at all \ntimes; it is therefore advisable that patients be given a prescription at the time of initiating \ntreatment with BIBW 2992. \n \nThe recommendations for management are as follows: \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n39\n\u2022 \nIf any diarrhoea is experienced (CTCAE Grade 1), two 2 mg loperamide tablets \nshould be taken immediately, followed by one 2 mg tablet with every loose bowel \nmovement, up to a maximum daily dose of 10 tablets (20 mg). \n\u2022 \nIn the event of diarrhoea patients should be advised to avoid lactose-containing \nproducts or any foods known to aggravate diarrhoea. \n\u2022 \nOral hydration is essential regardless of severity; appropriate rehydration (1.5 \nl/m2/day plus equivalent of actual fluid loss) and electrolyte replacement has to be \nensured in the event of CTCAE Grade 2 and Grade 3 adverse events. \n\u2022 \nFor CTCAE Grade 3 diarrhoea or CTCAE Grade 2 diarrhoea lasting \u2265 2 days (48 \nhours) despite adequate antidiarrhoeal treatment, BIBW 2992 must be paused until \nrecovery to CTCAE \u2264 Grade 1. Upon recovery, BIBW 2992 should be resumed at a \nreduced dose according to the dose reduction scheme outlined in Section 4.1.4.1.1. \n \nThe occurrence of diarrhoea and the outcome of treatment will be recorded in the AE section \nof the CRF. Antidiarrhoeal treatments should be documented in the concomitant medication \nsection of the CRF. \n \nIf despite optimal supportive care and a treatment pause, diarrhoea does not resolve to CTC \nGrade \u22641 within 14 days, the patient must not receive any further BIBW 2992 treatment and \nthe end of treatment (EOT) visit should be performed. \n \n4.4.2 Management of nausea and vomiting following treatment with BIBW 2992 (Arm \nA) \nNausea and vomiting may significantly affect patients\u2019 adherence to the treatment and their \nquality of life. In order to reduce the occurrence and the intensity of emesis, the patients \nshould be treated according to the recommendation given in Table 4.4.2:1. \n \nTable 4.4.2:1 Management of nausea and vomiting \nCTCAE Grade \nAntiemetic treatment \nNausea = grade 0 \nand \nVomiting = grade 0  \nNo antiemetic prophylactic treatment \nNausea = grade 1 \nand \nVomiting = grade 0 \nNo antiemetic treatment \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n40\nNausea = grade 2 \nand \nVomiting = grade 0 \n \nNausea = grade 0, 1 or 2 \nand \nVomiting = grade 1 or 2 \nAntiemetic treatment1\n \nPause BIBW 2992 treatment if grade 2 vomiting or \ngrade 2 nausea persist for 7 or more consecutive \ndays despite optimal supportive care.

Antiemetic treatments should be documented in the concomitant \nmedication section of the CRF with the start and end of treatment dates and daily dose. \n \nIn case of nausea and/or vomiting \u2265 CTCAE grade 2, appropriate hydration (1.5 L/m2/day \nplus hydration deficit) must be ensured. \n \n4.4.3 Management of rash following treatment with BIBW 2992 (Arm A) \nA proactive and early approach to management of rash is crucial. Rash can be managed by a \nvariety of treatment options to relieve symptoms and reduce the rash. \n \nThe recommendations for management are as follows: \n\u2022 General/Prevention: strict sun protection; use of a sunscreen of Sun Protection Factor \n15 (SPF 15) or higher, preferably containing zinc oxide; use of a thick, alcohol-free \nemollient cream; avoid harsh detergents, avoid using a solarium. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade 1 rash: mild rash may not need treatment. However, if treatment is \nconsidered necessary, topical hydrocortisone (1% or 2.5%) cream and/or clindamycin \n1% gel can be used. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade 2 rash: relief from major symptoms caused by CTCAE Grade 2 skin-\nrelated adverse events should be achieved by a combination of local and systemic \ntherapies including: \n1) Systemic antibiotics (doxycycline or minocycline etc.). \n2) Topical treatment (hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, clindamycin 1% gel, pimecrolimus \n1% cream). \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n41\nAnd / or \n1) Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, etc.) \n2) Oral prednisone (short term i.e., <14 days treatment) may be added at investigator\u2019s \ndiscretion. \nSystemic and topical treatment should be initiated at the start of CTCAE Grade 2 rash \nand continue until improvement or resolution to CTCAE Grade \u22641. If grade 2 rash \npersists for \u2265 7 days despite treatment and is poorly tolerated by the patient, the \ninvestigator may choose to pause treatment for up to 14 days followed by a reduction in \nthe dose of BIBW 2992 according to the dose reduction scheme in Table 4.1.4.1.1:1. \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade 3 (or greater) rash: may be treated in a manner similar to CTCAE \nGrade 2 rash. In the event of CTCAE Grade \u22653 rash, treatment with BIBW 2992 should \nbe paused until recovery to CTCAE Grade \u22641. Treatment should be resumed at a reduced \ndose (see Section 4.1.4.1). If CTCAE Grade \u22653 rash does not resolve to CTCAE Grade \n\u22641 within 14 days of stopping BIBW 2992 treatment and despite optimal supportive care, \nthe patient should not receive any further treatment with BIBW 2992 and the End of \nTreatment visit should be performed. \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n42\n5. \nOBSERVATIONS \n5.1 \nEFFICACY - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR PHARMACODYNAMICS \n5.1.1 Primary Endpoint \nThe primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) in all randomized patients, defined as \ntime from the date of randomization to the date of progression or to the date of death, \nwhichever occurs first. \n \n5.1.2 Secondary Endpoints \nSecondary endpoints are; \n\u2022 Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease \n(PD) according to RECIST 1.1  (R09-0262) \n\u2022 Overall survival (OS) defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the \ndate of death. \n\u2022 Time to deterioration of body weight (defined as the first occurrence of a decrease from \nbaseline of more than 10 %) and time to deterioration of ECOG performance status.  \n\u2022 Health-related quality of life (HRQOL). \n\u2022 Pharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992 (see Section 5.5) \n\u2022 Safety of BIBW 2992 as indicated by intensity and incidence of adverse events, graded \naccording to US NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 (R04-0474). \n \n5.1.3 Tumour Assessment \nResponse will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262). Complete Response (CR), \nPartial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive Disease (PD) will be assessed by \nthe investigator and also by a central imaging unit (see Section 5.1.4). \n \nEvery effort should be made to objectively evaluate tumour response and confirm tumour \nprogression with radiological tumour imaging for all patients who enter into the trial, \nincluding those who discontinue prematurely. \n \nOne to five target lesions (not exceeding two lesions per organ) should be identified at \nscreening by Computed Tomography (CT). Skin lesions should be measured and \nphotographic documentation should be performed. Individual lesions detected at screening \nwill be numbered and recorded in the CRF. These lesions should be followed up with the \nsame method(s) used at screening and the same numbering should be applied. The size of the \ntarget lesions will be recorded in millimetres. The examinations should be performed at \nscreening, after 6 weeks, after 12 weeks and every 6 weeks thereafter. After week 48, \nassessments should be performed every 12 weeks. If a patient develops an allergy to contrast \nmedia, MRI scans can be substituted for CT scans. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n43\nTumour assessment does not need to be performed at the screening visit if there are valid \nresults available from assessments which were performed as part of routine clinical practice \nwithin the allowed time window (within 28 days prior to start of treatment). \n \nTarget lesions should be selected based on their size (those with the longest diameter) and \nsuitability for accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions should be identified as non-\ntarget lesions and will be recorded at baseline. The non-target lesions will be followed during \nthe patients\u2019 participation and will be taken into consideration when determining the patients\u2019 \nresponse. \n \nFull details of RECIST 1.1 assessment can be found in Appendix 4. \n \nA bone scan should be performed at baseline in cases of clinical suspicion of previously \nunknown bone metastasis (e.g. bone or joint pain associated with relevant increases of \ncalcium and alkaline phosphatase). If the patient has known bone metastases or if bone \nmetastases are detected at screening, correlative imaging (X-ray or CT scan) should be done \nof the respective lesion(s) at baseline and subsequently correlative imaging of known bone \nlesions should be performed at every imaging time-point. During study treatment, bone scans \nshould be performed when medically indicated e.g. in case of suspected new bone metastases. \n \nIn the event of a delay, interruption or discontinuation of treatment, tumour assessment \nshould continue to follow the original schedule. The schedule should be followed until \nprogression is observed or until the patient commences further treatment for disease, \nwhichever occurs first. \n \n5.1.4 Central imaging \nAll image data will be sent to a central imaging unit to obtain an independent blinded \nconfirmation of tumour response assessment based on a uniform interpretation of \nradiographic image data for all patients enrolled in the trial. Upon receipt, the central imaging \nunit will log all image data into a tracking system and perform quality control of digitised \nradiographic images. An independent review of radiographic images including (i) sequential \nlesion selection and measurement and (ii) incremental radiological response assessment \nfollowed by (iii) global review of tumour response or progression will be performed by two \nblinded (with regard to patient, treatment, and visit) radiologists. In the case of disagreement \non the radiological assessment at any time-point between the two primary reviewers, a third \nadjudicating radiologist will select one of the primary reviewer\u2019s interpretations for all time-\npoints. The data will also be reviewed by an oncologist who will provide a final assessment \nfor each patient. \n \nThe review of the image data will be performed by independent radiologists, who are not \naffiliated with the study. All procedures will be done according to the specifications provided \nin the investigator site file. The purpose of the blinded reading is to independently assess \npatient response to therapy and disease progression. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n44\nModifications of the conventional RECIST 1.1 lesion measurement criteria will be introduced \ninto the measurement process in an attempt to reduce variability in the measurements for the \nindependent central imaging review. \n \nEligibility and treatment decisions will be based on the assessment of disease by the \ninvestigator. Central imaging will not be used for this purpose and the results of the central \nimaging review will not be communicated to the investigator. \n \n5.1.5 Health-Related Quality Of Life \nHealth-Related Quality Of life (HRQOL) will be measured with the following \nmultidimensional questionnaires included in Appendix 3. \n \n\u2022 \nEQ-5D health status self-assessment questionnaire (R96-2382) \n \n\u2022 EORTC QLQ-C30, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer \n(EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) (R99-1213, R07-2064) \n \n\u2022 EORTC Lung cancer specific supplementary module (EORTC QLQ-LC13) (R07-2060, \nR07-2065) \n \nAll three questionnaires will be completed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart. \nQuestionnaires should be completed by patients prior to seeing the clinician, prior to clinical \nassessment, prior to any treatment at the clinic, and before provision of any new information \nabout their disease status so that the responses are not influenced (biased). The questionnaires \ngenerally take about 5-10 minutes to complete. Once completed, the questionnaires should be \nhanded to the study co-ordinator or nurse. The data will then be transferred into the CRF by \nthe sponsor. The questionnaires represent source documents (please refer to Section 8.2.4).  \nValidated translations exist for all questionnaires for all countries participating in the study \nand patients will receive the questionnaires in their native language. \n \nAny unsolicited information provided by the patient on the questionnaire and any safety \nrelated data obtained from the patient\u2019s responses to the standard questions on the \nquestionnaires will be immediately reported to the investigator. Adverse event information \nfrom the questionnaire will be appropriately reported in the CRF. \n \nIf local regulations require the completed questionnaires to be confidential (i.e. not seen by \nthe site staff) appropriate arrangements will be made to ensure confidentiality. \n \nThe patient perspective is considered a supportive contribution to inform physicians on the \nclinical utility of BIBW 2992 compared to standard chemotherapy in the NSCLC population \nunder investigation. In addition, the EQ-5D, HRQOL assessment will inform a later health \neconomic (cost-effectiveness) analysis. \n \nEQ-5D \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n45\nThe EQ-5D is a disease generic instrument that has been widely used and has been found to \ncapture HRQOL changes in NSCLC (R07-2129, R07-2130). The EQ-5D comprises the \nfollowing two questionnaires: \n \n1. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, \npain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension comprises three levels (no \nproblems, some/moderate problems, extreme problems). \n \n2. The EQ VAS records the respondents self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0- \n100) visual analogue scale. \n \nFor the EQ-5D the respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by placing a cross in \nthe box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. Additional \ninstructions are provided in the ISF. \n \nQLQ-C30 and LC-13 \n \nThe QLQ-C30 is comprised of 30 questions. The QLQ-C30 incorporates both multi-items \nscales and single-item measures. These include one global health status/HRQOL scale, five \nfunctional scales, three symptoms scales and six single items to assess dyspnea, insomnia, \nappetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties. Each of the multi-item scales \nincludes a different set of items- no item occurs in more than one scale (R07-2064). The \nQLQ-LC13 module comprises 13 questions. The module is designed for use in patients \nreceiving treatment with chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy. The QLQ-LC13 incorporates \none multi-item scale to assess dyspnoea, and a series of single items assessing pain, \ncoughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and haemoptysis (R07- \n2064). \n \n5.2 \nSAFETY \n5.2.1 Adverse Events \nDuring the screening phase of the trial, the patient\u2019s condition will be assessed (e.g., \ndocumentation of history / concomitant diagnoses and diseases), and subsequently all \nrelevant changes from baseline will be noted. \n \nThe definition of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) can be found in \nSection 8.4.1. A list of expected adverse events with BIBW 2992 can be found in the \ninvestigator brochure (U03-3218). \n \nPatients will be required to report spontaneously any adverse events (AEs) as well as the \ndates of onset and end of these events. Specific questions will be asked wherever required or \nuseful to more precisely describe an AE and to allow a grading according to CTCAE, Version \n3 (R04-0474). \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n46\nA carefully written record of all AEs shall be kept by the investigator in charge of the trial. \nRecords of AEs shall include data on the date of onset, end date and CTCAE grading of the \nevent as well as any treatment or action required for the event and its outcome. \n \nRegular and continuing assessment of safety will be performed at least once per course \nduring the first 6 courses and every 3 weeks thereafter. Dose reduction schemes are provided \nin Section 4.1.4.1.1 and Section 4.1.4.2 for patients who experience specified adverse events \nand who, at the discretion of the investigator, could derive benefit from continuing treatment \non the protocol. \n \nAdverse events with an onset during therapy with trial medication or within 28 days after \ndiscontinuation of drug intake are considered as \u201con-treatment\u201d. Adverse events which are \nnot yet recovered at the End of Treatment visit will be followed up until recovery or in case \nof persistence sufficient characterisation of the toxic effects has been achieved and the \ninvestigator and Boehringer Ingelheim agree not to pursue them further. Adverse events that \noccur between Follow-up 1 (21 days after End of Treatment) and the final follow-up visit \n(see Section 6.1.4 for definition) will only be reported if they are considered related to trial \nmedication or procedures by the investigator. \n \nAdverse events occurring after the final follow-up visit (during the observation period) will \nbe reported only if considered serious (SAEs) and related to trial medication. Data regarding \ndeaths which are not related to trial medication will be collected for the purposes of assessing \nthe overall survival endpoint but these deaths will not be reported as SAEs. \n \nA summary of the requirements is given in Table 5.2.1:1. \n \nTable 5.2.1:1 AE/SAE reporting requirements \n \nTime period \nReporting requirements \nScreening to Follow-up 1 (21 days after End \nof Treatment (EOT)) \nReport all AEs and SAEs regardless of \nrelatedness. This includes all deaths. \nFollow-up 1 to Final Follow-up (see Section \n6.1.4 for definition of final follow-up) \nReport AEs and SAEs which are considered \nrelated to study treatment or procedures. \n \nDeath should not be reported as an SAE \nunless considered related to study treatment \nor procedures (because death is an endpoint  \nand will be followed-up separately) \nObservation Period \nReport only SAEs which are considered \nrelated to study treatment or procedures. \n \nDeath should not be reported as an SAE \nunless considered related to study treatment \nor procedures (because death is an endpoint \nand will be followed-up separately). \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n47\n \nDefinitions and requirements for documentation and reporting of AEs and serious adverse \nevents (SAEs) during a trial in the CRF are provided in Section 8.4.1. \n \nPatients may be hospitalised for administrative reasons during the trial. These and other \nhospitalisations planned at the beginning of the trial need not be reported as SAEs if they \nhave been documented at the screening visit and have been performed as planned. \n \nChanges observed in safety tests including blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiogram \n(ECG) and laboratory tests will be recorded as AEs and graded according to CTCAE, if they \nare not associated with an already reported AE, symptom or diagnosis, and meet at least one \nof the following criteria: \n \n\u2022 \nAction is required and taken with the investigational drug, i.e., dose reduction or \ntreatment discontinuation \n \n\u2022 \nTreatment is required (i.e., a concomitant medication is added or changed). \n \n5.2.2 Worsening of pre-existing conditions \nExpected fluctuations or expected deterioration of the underlying disease will not be recorded \nas an AE. If progressive disease occurs and is associated with symptoms or meets one of the \nseriousness criteria (see Section 8.4.1), the signs and symptoms of progressive disease will be \nreported as an adverse event or a serious AE (if applicable). \n \nThe only exception to the above is in the event of a death which is attributed to progressive \ndisease but where the signs and symptoms are not available. In this situation it is acceptable \nto report the progressive disease as the serious AE. \n \nA pre-existing condition present at baseline, which remains unchanged during the trial, does \nnot need to be recorded as adverse event. However, any worsening of any pre-existing \nbaseline condition should be reported as an adverse event. Examples of worsening of a \npreexisting condition that should be recorded as an AE are given below; \n \n\u2022 \nWorsening of condition meets the criteria for an SAE \n \n\u2022 \nAction is taken with the investigational drug (i.e. dose is reduced or treatment is \ndiscontinued) \n \n\u2022 \nTreatment is required (concomitant medication is added or changed) \n \n\u2022 \nThe investigator believes a patient has shown a clear deterioration from baseline \nsymptoms \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n48\n5.2.3 Assessment of Healthcare Resource use \nIf patients are hospitalised due to adverse events, the reason for hospitalisation, the duration \nof hospital stay, emergency room admission and time in the intensive care unit will be \ndocumented in the CRF. Adverse event related outpatient visits and interventions will also be \ndocumented in the CRF. \n \nInformation on caregiver support (home care), hospital and outpatient visits (other than \nscheduled visits) collected in the CRF will inform on healthcare resource use required to treat \nthe trial indication and adverse events observed during the trial. The data collected will be \nused for a later health economic (cost-effectiveness) analysis. \n \n5.2.4 Laboratory investigations \nBlood samples will be collected at the time points specified in the Flow Chart and analysed in \na laboratory facility at (or close to) the investigational site. Safety laboratory examinations \ninclude haematology and biochemistry. In case of neutropenia, blood will be examined as \nclinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator until recovery. \n \nFor patients randomized to Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy (Arm B) the decision to \ncontinue treatment will be based on assessment of laboratory parameters. Therefore the \nresults of these assessments should be available and assessed on the day of treatment prior to \ncommencing treatment. \n \nSafety laboratory assessment may be performed according to local practice but must include \nat least the following parameters: \n \nHaematology            Red blood cell count (RBC), neutrophils, haemoglobin, hematocrit, \nwhite blood cell count (WBC) and differential, platelets. \n \nBiochemistry  \nGlucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, aspartate amino \ntransferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline \nphosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, urea \n(BUN), total protein, uric acid, creatine phosphokinase (CPK). In case \nof pathological CPK further evaluation (e.g., by Troponin assays) \nshould be performed and the findings documented in the CRF. \nGlomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) will be estimated by the Cockgroft-\nGault Formula utilizing serum creatinine values. \n \nUrinalysis  \npH, glucose, erythrocytes, leukocytes, protein, nitrite will be analysed \nby dipstick. In case of abnormal findings, further evaluation (g/24 hrs \nurine sampling) should be performed and the findings documented in \nthe CRF. \n \nPregnancy test  \n\u03b2-HCG testing in urine will be performed in women of childbearing \npotential at screening (SV2). \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n49\nAt screening, creatinine clearance for study eligibility may be measured or may be calculated \nusing the Cockroft-Gault Formula. \n \n5.2.5 Physical examination, performance score \nA physical examination will be performed at screening and at the time points specified in the \nFlow Chart. \n \nA full physical exam serves as a clinical tumour assessment and should include a \ncardiopulmonary examination, examination of the regional lymph nodes, examination of the \nabdomen and an assessment of the mental and neurological status. Additional symptoms \nwhich have not been reported during a previous examination should be clarified. Wherever \npossible the same investigator should perform this examination. \n \nA limited physical examination should include a cardiopulmonary examination, a clinical \ntumour assessment, an examination of the regional lymph nodes and an examination of the \nabdomen. \n \nMeasurement of height (in cm) and body weight (in kg) and the evaluation of the ECOG \nperformance score will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart. \n \n5.2.6 ECG \nA 12-lead resting ECG will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart. \nECGs will be performed using a digital ECG machine and the data will be sent to a central \nassessment centre for evaluation. \n \nThe investigator should also review the ECG data at the time of the visit and this will be used \nto make decisions on eligibility for the study and treatment. However, the investigator should \nalso review the results of the central review when received. \n \n5.2.7 Left ventricular function \nLeft Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) as measured by echocardiography or MUGA scan \nwill be assessed at time points specified in the Flow Chart.

Tumour material will be \nsubmitted to the central laboratory as at least five (5), but preferably seven (7), 10 \u00b5m \nunstained sections mounted on non-charged microscopic slides as described in the Laboratory \nManual and in the Investigator Site File (ISF). If an equivalent quantity of material is \navailable as sections of different thickness, this is acceptable (e.g. 6 x 7.5 \u00b5m, 8 x 5 \u00b5m). It is \nrecommended that the sections should contain at least 20% tumour pathology. \n \nTumour tissue should be paraffin-embedded material obtained from initial diagnostic surgery \nfor NSCLC. If a tumour biopsy is performed as part of routine clinical practice prior to trial \nparticipation and material is available for analysis, the biopsy does not need to be repeated. If \ntissue is available from more than one occasion, the latest obtained tissue should be used \nwherever possible.

In addition, a central pathology review will be performed, including assessment of \npercentage of tumour involvement, but this will not be reported to investigators. \n \nThe following somatic EGFR mutations are detected; \n \n\u2022 19 deletions in exon 19 \n \n\u2022 L858R \n \n\u2022 3 insertions in exon 20 \n \n\u2022 L861Q \n \n\u2022 G719S, G719A and G719C \n \n\u2022 T790M \n \n\u2022 S768I \n \nSamples testing positive for one of these mutations will be reported as 'Positive' and the \npatient will be eligible for Screening Visit 2. The stratification category and the type of \nmutation will be specified in the report to the investigator. If a mutation is not detected, the \nresult will be reported as 'Negative' and the patient will be recorded as a Screen Failure. In \nthe event that the EGFR mutation test is inconclusive the investigator is allowed to send \nfurther material for testing if desired. \n \nIn addition, a blood sample will be collected on Course 1 day 1 for EGFR mutation analysis. \nThis sample is compulsory but the results will not be reported to investigators \n \nDuring follow-up (after progression) a further blood sample and tissue sample for EGFR \nmutation analysis may be taken but are optional. The sample requirements are the same as \nthose at screening. \n \nMaterial submitted for EGFR mutation analysis may be used for the validation of alternative \nmethods for detection of EGFR mutations, which may include detection of additional \nmutations. The results of these analyses will not be reported to investigators. If local \nregulations allow, any excess material will be shipped and stored at Boehringer Ingelheim, \nGermany until any required validation has taken place or until it is decided that there is no \nrequirement for validation. Samples will be destroyed at the latest 5 years after the last patient \nstudy visit. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n54\n \nIf both L858R and a deletion in exon 19 are detected in the same sample, the patient will be \nallocated to the \u2018L858R\u2019 stratificatkion category. In any other case where more than one \nmutation is detected, the patient will be allocated to the \u2018other mutation\u2019 stratification \ncategory. \n \n5.6.2 \nAnalytical determinations \nPharmacogenetics investigates genetic variations in patients to explain and to predict their \nindividual response to drugs. \n \nTo allow pharmacogenetic analyses, patients will be asked for one extra blood sample after \nrandomization. Donation of this blood sample for pharmacogenetics is voluntary and not a \nprerequisite for participation in the study. The sample will only be taken and processed or \nstored after separate informed consent is given in accordance with local ethical and \nregulatory requirements. \n \nThe blood sample for pharmacogenetic analysis will be anonymised. The anonymisation \nprocedure will guarantee the legally required level of data protection for the donor. Once the \nanonymisation has been carried out, there will be no legal way to trace back to the identity of \nthe donor. The anonymised DNA may be analysed at a later time to identify whether there are \ngenetic factors that could contribute to a better therapeutic outcome or a higher risk of \ndeveloping treatment-related adverse drug reactions. These analyses may include genes \nrelated to efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics. The sample (or the DNA derived from it) \nwill be stored at Boehringer Ingelheim for 15 years after the end of the clinical trial or until \nthere is no more material available for tests. \n \nThe pharmacogenetic sampling will not be performed in countries where local regulations \nprohibit the shipment of biological materials to Germany. \n \n5.6.2.1 Methods and timing of sample collection \nIf consent is given, the sample for pharmacogenetic testing may be taken at any time after \nrandomization, but preferably on Day 1 of Course 1. A maximum of 8.5 mL blood will be \ncollected in a PaxGene DNA blood sampling tube. The Paxgene Blood DNA tubes can be \nstored and shipped at room temperature within 14 days. If a longer storage and shipment \nperiod for Paxgene Blood DNA tubes is necessary, the blood samples have to be stored at a \ntemperature of -20 centigrade or below. Once frozen, thawing of the samples should be \navoided. Detailed instructions for pharmacogenetic sampling, handling and shipment of \nsamples are provided in the ISF \n \n5.6.2.2 Analytical determinations \nGenomic DNA will be extracted from blood samples according to standard molecular \ngenetics methods and analysed by TaqMan\u00ae\uf020or other standard genotyping technologies. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n55\n \n5.7 \nPHARMACOKINETIC - PHARMACODYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP \nCorrelation between drug concentration and response may be made if adequate appropriate \ndata are available.

At \nScreening Visit 1, biopsy material will be analysed by a central laboratory for EGFR \nmutation status. Patients who test positive for an EGFR mutation will proceed to Screening \nVisit 2, when full assessments will take place. \n \nAll Screening Visit 2 procedures must be performed in the 28 days prior to the first \nadministration of study medication. \n \nPatients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized and treatment must commence \nwithin 2 days after randomization. \n \n6.1.2 \nTreatment \nPatients randomized to arm A (BIBW 2992) will receive continuous daily treatment until the \ncriteria for stopping medication are met (see Section 6.3.1). For administrative purposes \ntreatment is divided into courses, which are each 3 weeks (21 days) in duration. \n \nPatients randomized to arm B (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy) will receive up to 6 \ncourses of treatment, each 21 days in length. Treatment may be discontinued prior to 6 \ncourses if the criteria for stopping medication are met (see Section 6.3.1). \n \nDuring the treatment phase visits should be performed as scheduled wherever possible, but \nwithin 2 days of the scheduled date. \n \n6.1.3 \nEnd of Treatment visit \nAll patients should be evaluated at the end of treatment (EOT). \n \nIn arm A (BIBW 2992) the EOT visit should be performed within 14 days of permanent \ndiscontinuation of BIBW 2992. If the decision to discontinue BIBW 2992 is taken during a \nscheduled visit, the EOT visit should be performed instead of the scheduled visit. \n \nIn arm B (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy) the EOT visit should be performed 21 days \n(\u00b1 7 days) after course 6 day 1. If the patient does not complete 6 courses of treatment, the \nvisit should be performed within 14 days of the decision to end treatment. \n \n6.1.4 \nFollow-up \nAll patients should have the first follow-up visit (FU1) 21 days (\u00b1 7 days) after the EOT visit. \nThis visit should be performed regardless of whether the patient has commenced further \ntreatment. If the patient has already started another treatment at the first follow-up, the visit \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n57\nshould still be performed and the new treatment should be recorded as concomitant \nmedication. \n \nPatients who have not progressed and not started further treatment at the first follow-up visit \nshould have further follow-up visits every 21 days (\u00b1 7 days) until progression or start of \nfurther treatment. \n \nPatients will be considered to have completed the study at the follow-up visit where \nprogression is first documented or where further treatment has begun. This follow-up visit \nwill be termed the 'final follow-up visit'. \n \n6.1.5 \nObservation period \nAfter completion of the study patients will enter an observation period. During the \nobservation period no study visits will be performed, but data regarding progression, further \ntreatment (including best response and reason for stopping treatment) and death will be \ncollected every 60 days (\u00b1 15 days) until death. Information will be collected from the patient \nnotes or by telephone contact with the patient. \n \nThe observation period will end after all patients have died or 5 years after the last follow up \nvisit, whichever occurs first. \n \n6.1.6 \nTreatment after the End of Study \nFollowing progression, patients should receive adequate further treatment to prevent a \ntreatment bias between the two arms. \n \nIt is recommended that patients who progress after receiving BIBW 2992 in the clinical trial \nare subsequently treated with standard platinum-based combination chemotherapy if eligible. \nLicensed single-agent chemotherapy can be considered if patients are unable to tolerate \ncombination chemotherapy. \n \nIt is recommended that patients who progress after receiving first-line chemotherapy in the \nclinical trial should receive standard second line treatment with single agent chemotherapy \nand/or a licensed EGFR TKI, as long as they are clinically eligible.  \n \nSecond-line therapy should only be started following an objective and confirmed progression. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n58\n \n6.2 \nTRIAL PROCEDURES AT EACH VISIT \n6.2.1 \nScreening and run-in in phases \nScreening Visit 1 \nScreening Visit 1 should be performed within 6 weeks of the first administration of study \nmedication \nInformed Consent 1 \nWritten informed consent must be obtained \nbefore any study-specific screening \nassessments are performed.

The primary \nobjective of the statistical analysis is to determine whether BIBW 2992 prolongs progression-\nfree survival (PFS) in comparison to chemotherapy. \n \n7.2 \nNULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES \nThe alternative hypothesis of the primary analysis is that the progression-free survival time is \nlonger for patients treated with BIBW 2992 than for those who receive chemotherapy.  That \nis \n \nHA: SBIBW(t) > SChemo(t), for t>0 \nThe null hypothesis tested by this trial is: \n \nH0: SBIBW(t) \u2264 SChemo(t), for t>0 \nwhere S(t) is the probability that a patient passes time t without dying or experiencing disease \nprogression. The subscripts represent the two treatment groups.  The null hypothesis will be \ntested at the one-sided 0.025 level. \nIf the difference between the treatment groups for the primary efficacy endpoint is \nstatistically significant then formal statistical testing will be performed on the key secondary \nendpoints. In order to protect the overall type I error rate a closed testing procedure will be \nemployed, whereby each key secondary endpoint will only be formally analysed if the \nprevious endpoint was found to be statistically significant. The key secondary endpoints will \nbe analysed according to the order they are presented in Section 7.3.2 below. \n \n7.3 \nPLANNED ANALYSES \nThe primary analyses will include all randomized patients. \n \n7.3.1 \nPrimary analyses \nThe primary endpoint of this study is progression-free survival, defined as the time from the \ndate of randomisation to the date of disease progression, or to the date of death if a patient \ndied earlier. The analysis will be based upon the evaluation of tumour imaging as reviewed \nby an independent central unit, blinded to treatment assignments. \nThe primary analysis of PFS will be conducted when at least 217 patients have progressed or \ndied.  This is expected to take approximately 19-20 months, assuming 330 patients are \nrandomised over a period of 9-10 months. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n68\nA stratified log-rank test will be used to test for the effect of BIBW 2992. The test will be \nstratified by EGFR mutation (L858R vs. del 19 vs. other).  \nA Cox proportional-hazards model will be used to derive the hazard ratio and 95 % \nconfidence interval between the two randomised regimens.  Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% \nCI will be calculated at the time of each planned imaging assessment. \nDisease progression will be evaluated according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria (R09-0262), with \nadaptations as described in the imaging charter. \nFor patients with known date of progression (or death): \n\u2022 PFS [days] = earlier of date of progression or death \u2013 date of randomisation + 1. \n \nPatients with unknown disease progression status or date, or who are treated with new \nanticancer therapy will be handled as described in Section 7.4 \n \n7.3.2 \nSecondary analyses \n7.3.2.1 Key Secondary analyses \nThe following key secondary analyses will be performed according to the statistical testing \nstrategy detailed in Section 7.2 \n7.3.2.1.1 Best RECIST assessment \nEach patient will be assigned to one of the following RECIST 1.1 categories based on \nindependent central review, irrespective of protocol violations or missing data:  \n\u2022 CR (complete response) \n\u2022 PR (partial response) \n\u2022 SD (stable disease) \n\u2022 PD (progressive disease) \n\u2022 Not evaluable (not assessable, insufficient data) \n \nObjective response is defined as CR and PR. Time to objective response is the time from \nrandomisation to the date of first documented CR or PR. The duration of objective response \nis the time from first documented CR or PR to the time of progression or death. Disease \ncontrol is defined as CR, PR, and/or SD.  \nLogistic regression will be used to test for a difference between regimens for objective \nresponse and for disease control. The statistical model will include the same stratification \nfactor used for the analysis of PFS.  Nominal significance levels will be reported. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n69\nObjective response will be tabulated both overall and within EGFR mutation categories.  \nDescriptive statistics will be calculated for the duration of objective response and duration of \ndisease control. \n7.3.2.1.2 Overall survival (OS)  \nThe treatment regimens will be compared in terms of time to death, but unequal treatment \nafter progression is expected to obscure any effect of BIBW 2992 relative to chemotherapy.  \nSimilarly to PFS, the stratified log-rank test will be used to test OS.   \nOS will be analyzed twice. The first analysis will be performed at the time of the primary \nPFS analysis.  A second analysis will be performed somewhat later with the aim of providing \nas much information as possible on OS.  With 330 patients randomised over a period of 9-10 \nmonths and a median time to death of 20 months (HR= 1.0), approximately 219 deaths would \nbe expected within 36 months. \nTo preserve the overall 0.025, one-sided alpha-level, a Haybittle-Peto stopping boundary will \nbe used (p-value <0.0001) for the analysis of OS performed at the time of the primary PFS \nanalysis. \nIn addition to the formal treatment comparison, the analyses will describe the overall pattern \nof time to death, together with the extent and influence of post-progression treatment.  \nThe following analyses will examine the pattern of time to death for consistency with the PFS \nresults, while accounting for the extent and influence of post-progression intervention: \n\u2022 \ntest for a difference between treatment regimens at six, nine, and twelve months, \n\u2022 \ndescribe the cumulative proportion of deaths at each scheduled tumour assessment time \npoint \n\u2022 \ntabulate the specific anti-cancer treatments after progression \n\u2022 \ndescribe the effect of additional anti-cancer treatment, by separating patients into the \nfollowing sub-groups \n\ufffd \nthose not eligible for additional treatment \no \npatients who did not progress \no \npatients who died within one month of progression \n\ufffd \nthose eligible for additional treatment \no \ndid not take additional treatment \no \ndid take additional treatment  \n7.3.2.2 Other secondary analyses \nThe following other secondary analyses will be performed. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n70\n7.3.2.2.1 Sensitivity and exploratory analyses for PFS  \nThe timing of imaging assessments will be described.  In order to account for the possible \neffect of mistimed or delayed imaging assessments, a sensitivity analyses will assign the \nmidpoint to PFS failures within time intervals that will be formed around the planned times \nof imaging assessments. \nAn additional analysis will assign all patients who progress in the chemotherapy arm to the \nlater assessment of progression (investigator or independent central unit review) and all \npatients who progress in the BIBW 2992 arm to the earliest assessment of progression. \nAn exploratory analysis will stratify the log-rank test by each of the EGFR mutations for \nwhich there are sufficient randomized patients. \nDescriptive methods (e.g. Forest plot) and Cox proportional-hazards will be used to examine \nthe effects of other baseline disease characteristics and demographic factors, including the \nstratification factor (EGFR mutation category), baseline sum of target lesions, geographical \nregion, ECOG, gender, and age. \n7.3.2.2.2 Tumour shrinkage  \nThe two treatment groups will be compared in terms of the minimum sum of target lesion \ndiameters recorded for each patient after randomisation, as measured by central imaging.  \nThe analysis will compare the treatments using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for \nminimum sum of diameters, using baseline sum of diameters as a covariate.  The \nrandomization stratum will be included as a classification factor. \n7.3.2.2.3 Body weight and ECOG performance status \nAnalyses will compare the treatment groups in terms of time to deterioration of: \n\u2022 body weight, defined as the first occurrence of a decrease from baseline of more than \n10 %, and \n\u2022 ECOG performance status, defined as the first instance of an increase in ECOG \ncategory. \n \nPatients who die before deteriorating will be analysed as having deteriorated at the time of \ndeath. Disease progression without deterioration will be censored at the time of the last \nmeasurement of weight or ECOG performance status. \nTime to deterioration will be analysed similarly to PFS i.e. by stratified log-rank test. \n7.3.2.2.4 Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL)  \nThe relevant HRQOL endpoints are the time to deterioration for the following three symptom \nscales/items measured on the QLQ-C30 or QLQ-LC13 questionnaire (R99-1213, R07-2060):  \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n71\n\u2022 cough (Question 1 on the QLQ-LC13),  \n\u2022 dyspnoea (composite of Questions 3-5 on the QLQ-LC13),  \n\u2022 pain (composite of Questions 9 and 19 on the QLQ-C30) \nScoring of the symptom scales/items will follow the EORTC scoring algorithm. For ease of \ninterpretation, a linear transformation will be used to standardise the raw scores of all items \nand scales, so that scores range from 0 to 100 (R07-2064). A higher score represents a higher \n(\u2018better\u2019) level of functioning (functional scales, global health status/QOL), or a higher \n(\u2018worse\u2019) level of symptoms (symptom scale/item) (R07-2064). \nTime to deterioration for the cough, dyspnoea, pain and symptom scales/items will be defined \nas the time to a 10-point increase from the baseline score (R07-2064, R99-1223, R07-2061).  \nPatients who die before deteriorating will be analysed as having deteriorated at the time of \ndeath. Disease progression without scale deterioration will be censored at the time of the last \nscale measurement. Patients with no HRQOL assessments will be censored at day of \nrandomisation. If a HRQOL assessment is missed, but followed by another assessment and \ndeterioration occurs during that period, the time to deterioration will be defined as the \nmidpoint between the two observed assessments. In addition, the three alternative measures \nof pain (Questions 10-12* in QLQ-LC13) will be examined descriptively for consistency \nwith the composite of questions 9 and 19 from the QLQ-C30, as will dyspnoea (Question 8) \nfrom the EORTC QLQ-C30 be compared with the dyspnoea composite (Questions 3-5* on \nthe QLQ-LC13). \nTime to deterioration will be analysed similarly to PFS i.e. log-rank test stratified by the \nstratification factor used at randomisation will be used to test for the effect of BIBW 2992.  \nThe individual items of the symptom scales will be examined for consistency with the \ncomposites.  \nIn addition, a comprehensive analysis of all subscales/items (where a single item is scored, \nR07-2064) will estimate the hazard ratio for time to deterioration with 95% confidence. The \nresults of these analyses will be displayed using a Forest plot to summarise the impact of \ntherapy over the entire profile of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 measures. \nAdditional analysis will describe the distribution of patients that are improved, stable, or \nworsened for each of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 summary scales and items (where a \nsingle item is scored, R07-2061). \n* Note that questions on the QLQ-LC13 are numbered consecutively following the QLQ-C30 \nas shown in Appendix 4. Consequently, Question 1 is numbered as Question 31 and \nQuestions 3-5 as Questions 33-35 \n \n7.3.3 \nSafety analyses \nAll randomised and treated patients will be included in the analysis of safety. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n72\nThe primary analysis of adverse events will be based upon events that start on or after first \nadministration of trial medication and within 28 days after the last administration trial \nmedication.  An additional analysis will compare the treatment regimens over a period of \ntime equivalent to six courses of chemotherapy. \nAdverse events as well as laboratory parameters will be graded according to CTCAE, \nVersion 3.0 (R04-0474).  Key safety measures will include: \n\u2022 events leading to dose reduction \n\u2022 events leading to permanent treatment discontinuation \n\u2022 the overall incidence and intensity of adverse events, as well as relatedness of adverse \nevents to treatment \n\u2022 causes of death \n\u2022 gastrointestinal events (diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea) \n\u2022 cutaneous reactions \n\u2022 oral irritation \n\u2022 decreased renal function \n\u2022 elevated liver function tests, \n\u2022 haematological abnormalities (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) \n\u2022 CTCAE Grade 2 with increase by at least one CTCAE grade from baseline, for selected \nlaboratory tests:  \n\u2022 (high values) INR, PTT, creatinine, AST, ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, \nproteinuria (dipstick or [g/24 hrs]) \n\u2022 (low values) haemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, total WBC \n\u2022 descriptive statistics for change from baseline for all laboratory tests   \n \nAdditional, more in-depth analyses will be performed as needed.  These analyses will \nexamine the influence of extent of exposure and time to event onset. \nKey adverse event tables will be reproduced to examine the effect of BIBW 2992 among \nspecial populations e.g. elderly, females. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n73\n7.3.4 \nInterim analyses \nA Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the safety data approximately \nevery six months. In order to completely assess the risk-benefit advantage of BIBW 2992, the \ncommittee may see the need during such regular meetings to examine survival and PFS. \nHowever, the significance level for the primary analysis of PFS will not be adjusted for the \ninterim looks by the DMC.  This is because the trial will not be stopped for superiority of \nBIBW 2992 vs. chemotherapy in terms of PFS prior to the primary analysis, which is \nscheduled to occur after 217 PFS failures. \n \n7.3.5 \nPharmacokinetic methods \nBIBW 2992 plasma concentrations will be summarized by time point by descriptive statistics \nand, if feasible, graphically inspected. A pharmacokinetic correlation plot analysis will be \nperformed on BIBW 2992 plasma concentrations.  \nObjectives of this analysis will be: \n\u2022 describe the trough BIBW 2992 plasma concentrations at steady state in the target \npatient population \n\u2022 to estimate the inter-individual and intra-individual variability of BIBW 2992 trough \nplasma concentrations  \n\u2022 to estimate the influence of covariates such as age, gender or weight on the variability \nof the BIBW 2992 trough plasma concentrations using correlation plot analysis \n7.4 \nHANDLING OF MISSING DATA \nThe central imaging unit will work with the clinical sites towards a standard implementation \nof the RECIST 1.1 criteria. An imaging charter will detail all procedures, including quality \ncontrol and the criteria needed to handle missing assessments.  \nPatients will continue to be followed for both progression and death after discontinuation of \nstudy treatment. \nTable 7.4: 1 describes how patients will be classified for the analysis of PFS.

The \ninvestigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on \nthe trial; also current medical records must be available. \nFor eCRFs all data must be derived from source documents, including the following: \n\u2022 \nPatients identification (gender, date of birth) \n\u2022 Patients participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date patient \nwas informed) \n\u2022 \nDates of patient\u2019s visits, including dispensing of trial medication \n\u2022 \nMedical history (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable) \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n79\n\u2022 \nMedication history \n\u2022 \nAdverse events (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if available)) \n\u2022 \nSerious adverse events (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if available)) \n\u2022 \nConcomitant therapy (start date, changes) \n\u2022 \nOriginals or copies of laboratory results (in validated electronic format, if available) \n\u2022 \nConclusion of Patient\u2019s Participation in the trial \n \n8.2.5 \nDirect access to source data - documents \nThe investigator / institution will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review \nand regulatory inspection, providing direct access to all related source data / documents. \nCRFs and all source documents, including progress notes and copies of laboratory and \nmedical test results must be available at all times for review by the sponsor\u2019s clinical trial \nmonitor, auditor and inspection by health authorities (e.g. sFDA). The Clinical Research \nAssociate (CRA) or on-site monitor may review all CRFs, and written informed consents. \nThe accuracy of the data will be verified by reviewing the documents described in Section \n8.2.4. \n \nData collected during the Observation Period will be checked for completeness and \nplausibility but will not require source data verification. \n \n8.3 \nQUALITY ASSURANCE AUDIT \nA quality assurance audit of this trial may be conducted by the sponsor or sponsor\u2019s \ndesignees. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the \ninvestigator\u2019s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation \nof this clinical trial. \n \n8.4 \nPROCEDURES \n8.4.1 \nAdverse events \nAn adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an \nexacerbation of a pre-existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a \npharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship \nwith this treatment. \n \nAll adverse events occurring during the course of the clinical trial (i.e., from signing the \ninformed consent to the final follow-up visit) will be collected, documented and reported to \nthe sponsor by the investigator according to the specific definitions and instructions detailed \nin the \u2018Adverse Event Reporting\u2019 section of the Investigator Site File. \n \nA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately \nlife-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, requires or prolongs \npatient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for \nany other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n80\njudgment which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention \nto prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. \n \nAll adverse events, serious and non-serious, will be fully documented on the appropriate \nCRFs. For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset, end, CTCAE grade \n(R04-0474), treatment required, outcome, seriousness and action taken with the \ninvestigational drug. The investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational \ndrug to all AEs as defined in the 'Adverse Event Reporting' Section of the Investigator Site \nFile. \n \nThere are no events defined as 'significant' for this study. All events will be categorised as \neither Adverse Event (AE) or Serious Adverse Event (SAE). \n \nThe basis for judging the causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE \nis described below. \n \nCausal relationship \n \nMedical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant \nfactors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, \nconfounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant \nhistory. Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms. \n \n\ufffd \nYes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational drug \nadministered and the AE. \n \n\ufffd \nNo: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational drug \nadministered and the AE. \n \nThe investigator has the obligation to report all AEs/ SAEs occurring between informed \nconsent and follow-up visit 1, regardless of causality. From follow-up 1 to final follow-up the \ninvestigator should report all AEs/SAEs which are related to the study treatment or \nprocedures. During the observation period, only SAEs considered related to the study \ntreatment should be reported. Deaths occurring after follow-up 1 do not need to be reported \nas SAEs unless considered related to study treatment or procedures. \n \nSAEs are to be reported to the sponsor using the BI Serious Adverse Event Report Form \nincluding a documented causal relationship assessment and providing as much detail \nregarding the SAE as possible. When follow-up information becomes available, all remaining \nfields on the SAE form are to be completed or updated. \n \nAny serious AE, whether or not considered related to the investigational product, and \nwhether or not the investigational product has been administered, must be reported \nimmediately by telephone / fax to the sponsor. Expedited reporting of serious adverse events, \ne.g. suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), will be done according to \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n81\nlocal regulatory requirements. Further details regarding this reporting procedure are provided \nin the ISF. \n \nFollowing every such telephone / fax report, the Clinical Monitor must provide a written \nreport of the serious AE and any sequelae to Corporate Drug Safety according to the \nappropriate Corporate SOP(s). These narratives, which confirm the information collected by \ntelephone, may give additional information not available at the time of the initial report. \n \n8.4.2 \nEmergency procedures \nNot applicable. \n \n8.4.3 \nContraception and Pregnancy \nFemale patients who are not of childbearing potential due to being postmenopausal (2 years \nwithout menses) or surgical sterilisation (oophorectomy, hysterectomy and/or tubal ligation) \ndo not need to use contraception. \n \nAll other female patients are considered to have childbearing potential and should use \nadequate contraception throughout the study (from screening until end of study participation \nor 28 days after last dose of trial medication, whichever is later). \n \nAcceptable methods of contraception for females include hormonal contraception and double \nbarrier method. Double barrier method of contraception is defined as two barrier methods \nused simultaneously each time the patient has intercourse. Accepted barrier methods include \ndiaphragm, female condom, cervical cap, male condom and IUD (the diaphragm and cervical \ncap must be used in conjunction with spermicidal jelly/cream). If hormonal contraceptives \nare used, at least one barrier method should also be used. Partner vasectomy, natural 'rhythm' \nand spermicidal jelly/cream are not acceptable as methods of contraception.  \n \nMale patients should use adequate contraception throughout the study (e.g. condom and \nspermicidal jelly). \n \nFemale patients must have a negative pregnancy test (\u03b2-HCG test in urine or serum) prior to \ncommencing study treatment. \nIf a patient is found to be pregnant during study participation, this should be handled as \nfollows;\n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n82\n \nTable 8.4.3: 1 Pregnancy reporting \nTiming of pregnancy \nAction \nPrior to commencing \nstudy medication \nPatient should be withdrawn from the study immediately. \nNo reporting necessary \nDuring study \ntreatment \nTreatment must be stopped immediately and the pregnancy should \nbe reported to the sponsor immediately using the pregnancy form. \nIf the investigator wishes to give any further treatment with study \nmedication, this must be discussed and agreed with the BI clinical \nmonitor. \nThe pregnancy should be followed up to final outcome and the \noutcome, including any premature termination should be reported \nto the sponsor on the pregnancy form. \nIn addition, any event leading to the termination of pregnancy (i.e. \nspontaneous, accidental, or induced abortion; as well as \nmiscarriage, intrauterine foetal demise/death) must be reported as \nan SAE. \nDuring follow-up \n(after finishing \ntreatment but before \nend of study \nparticipation). \nThe pregnancy should be reported to the sponsor immediately \nusing the pregnancy form. \nThe pregnancy should be followed up to final outcome and the \noutcome, including any premature termination should be reported \nto the sponsor on the pregnancy form. \nIn addition, any event leading to the termination of pregnancy (i.e. \nspontaneous, accidental, or induced abortion; as well as \nmiscarriage, intrauterine foetal demise/death) must be reported as \nan SAE. \nWithin 28 days of last \ndose of study \nmedication (even if no \nlonger participating in \nstudy \n \n8.5 \nRULES FOR AMENDING PROTOCOL \nAll CTP amendments must be documented, dated and signed by all signatories (or their \nsuccessors) of the original protocol. This also applies to any local amendment that may \nbecome necessary. Amendments (excluding those exclusively for administrative or logistical \nchanges) need to be submitted to the IRB / IEC for review/approval and to the competent \nauthority (CA) / regulatory authority for approval / notification according to local regulations. \nLocal Amendments will only be submitted in the countries / centres concerned. \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n83\n8.6 \nDISCONTINUATION OF THE TRIAL BY THE SPONSOR \nBoehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the trial at any time for the following \nreasons: \n \n1.

The recommended supportive care for Gemcitabine / Cisplatin \nchemotherapy is as follows; \n \n\u2022 \nPre-treatment hydration with 1 - 2 litres of fluid infused for 8 - 12 hours prior \nto Cisplatin will initiate diuresis. Adequate subsequent hydration should \nmaintain diuresis during the 24 hours following administration. \n\u2022 \nAntiemetic treatment should follow the recommendations given in the \nConsensus Statement of the Antiemetic Subcommittee of the Multinational \nAssociation of Supportive Care in cancer (MASCC): Prevention of \nchemotherapy- and radiotherapyinduced emesis: Results of the Perugia \nConsensus Conference (R06-0986). \n \nDose Modification Scheme \n \nDosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity may be required for gemcitabine and \nfor cisplatin. Gemcitabine dosage adjustment for hematological toxicity is based on \nthe granulocyte and platelet counts taken on the day of therapy. Patients receiving \ngemcitabine should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count \n(CBC), including differential and platelet counts. If marrow suppression is \ndetected, therapy should be modified or suspended according to the guidelines in \nTable 10.2:1. \n \nIn general, for severe (Grade 3 or 4) non-hematological toxicity, except alopecia \nand nausea/vomiting, therapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin should be held or \ndecreased by 50% depending on the judgment of the treating physician. During \ncombination therapy with cisplatin, serum creatinine, serum potassium, serum \ncalcium, and serum magnesium should be carefully monitored (Grade 3/4 serum \ncreatinine toxicity for gemcitabine plus cisplatin was 5% versus 2% for cisplatin \nalone). \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n94\n \n \n \nTable 10.2:1 Dosage Reduction Guidelines for Gemcitabine in combination with \nCisplatin  \n \nAbsolute granulocyte count  \n(x 10\n6/L)  \n \nPlatelet count  \n(x 10\n6\n/L)  \n% of full dose  \n\u22651000  \nand  \n\u2265100,000  \n100 \n500-999  \nor  \n50,000-99,999  \n75  \n<500  \nor  \n<50,000  \nHold  \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n95\n \n \n10.3 \nAPPENDIX 3   QUESTIONNAIRES \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n96\n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n97\n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n98\n \n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n99\n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n100\n \n \n \n \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n101\n \n \n10.4 \nAPPENDIX 4   RECIST 1.1 CRITERIA  \nThe criteria below are based on RECIST 1.1 (R09-0262). \n \nMeasurability of the disease \n \nMeasurable lesions \n \nLesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest \ndiameter \u2265 10 mm (by CT scan, MRI, caliper measurement) or \u2265 20 mm (by chest \nX-ray). \n \nMeasurable disease \n \nMeasurable disease requires the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the \nmeasurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be \nconfirmed by cytology/histology. \n \nNon-measurable disease \n \nNon-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest \ndiameter <10 mm with CT scan, MRI or caliper measurement or <20 mm with \nchest X-ray or pathological lymph nodes with shortest axis \u226510 and <15 mm) as \nwell as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly unmeasurable \ninclude leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, \ninflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal \nmasses/ abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not \nmeasurable by reproducible imaging techniques. \n \nNew lesions in irradiated fields \n \nPreviously irradiated lesions should not be used as indicator lesions. However, new \nlesions occurring in previously irradiated fields can be used to assess the \nantitumour response. \n \nMethods of measurement \n \nAll measurements must be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. \nAll baseline evaluations must be performed as close as possible to the treatment \nstart and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. If a lesion \nis considered too small to measure, a default measurement of 5mm should be \napplied. If the lesion is not visible, a default measurement of 0mm should be \napplied. \n \nThe same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to \ncharacterise each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. \nClinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., \nskin nodules, palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by \ncolour photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is obligatory. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n102\n \n \nCT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure \ntarget lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should \nbe performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT \nshould be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This \napplies to the chest, abdomen and pelvis. \n \nUltrasound, endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to measure tumour \nlesions or evaluate tumour response. However, these techniques can be useful to \nsupplement information from other techniques. \n \nTumour markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially \nabove the upper normal limit, they must normalise for a patient to be considered in \ncomplete clinical response. \n \nCytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare \ncases (for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, \nwhere known residual benign tumours can remain). \n \nBaseline Documentation of Target and Non-target Lesions \n \nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions \nin total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions \nand will be recorded, measured (longest diameter = LD) and numbered at baseline. \nTarget lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest \ndiameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by \nimaging techniques or clinically). Lymph nodes must be \u226515mm in order to be \nconsidered as target lesions. \n \nA sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and \nreported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to \nfurther characterize the objective tumour response of the measurable dimension of \nthe disease (see Table 10.4:1). \n \nTable 10.4:1 Evaluation of target lesions \nComplete Response \n(CR) \nDisappearance of all target lesions. \nPartial Response (PR)  \nAt least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target \nlesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. \nProgression (PD) \nAt least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target \nlesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD \nrecorded since the treatment started, together with an \nabsolute increase in the sum of LD of at least 5mm. OR  \nThe appearance of one or more new lesions. \nStable Disease (SD)  \n \nNeither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, taking as \nreference the baseline sum LD, nor sufficient increase to \nqualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum LD \nsince the treatment started. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n103\n \n \n \nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and \nshould also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these \nlesions should be followed as \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cabsent\u201d (see Table 10.4:2). \n \nTable 10.4:2  Evaluation of non-target lesions and new lesions \nComplete \nResponse (CR) \nDisappearance of all non-target lesions and normalisation of \ntumour marker level. \nNon-CR/ Non-PD  \nPersistence of one or more non-target lesions or/and \nmaintenance of tumour marker level above normal limits. \nProgression (PD) \nAppearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal \nprogression of existing non-target lesions. \n \nAlthough a clear progression of non-target lesions only is \nexceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the \ntreating physician should prevail and the progression status \nshould be confirmed later by the review panel (or study \nchair). \n \nIn some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from \nnormal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this \ndetermination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine \nneedle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status. \n \nConfirmation \n \nIn the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met SD criteria at least once \nafter study entry at a minimum interval of six weeks.  \n \nEvaluation of Best Response to Study Treatment \n \nThe best response to study treatment (Table 10.4:3) is the best response recorded \nfrom the start of treatment until disease progression or start of further anti-cancer \ntreatment (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements \nrecorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient\u2019s best response \nassignment will depend on the achievement of both measurements and \nconfirmation criteria (Table 10.4:3). \n \nPatients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of \ntreatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be \nreported as \u201csymptomatic deterioration\u201d. Every effort should be made to document \nthe objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n104\n \n \n \nTable 10.4:3  Algorithm for evaluation of overall best response* \n \nTarget lesions \nNon-target lesions \nNew lesions \nOverall response \nCR \nCR \nNo \nCR \nCR \nNon-CR/ Non- PD \nNo \nPR \nCR \nNot evaluated \nNo \nPR \nPR \nNon-PD or not \nevaluated \nNo \nPR \nSD \nNon-PD or not \nevaluated \nNo \nSD \nNot evaluated \nNon-PD \nNo \nNE \nPD \nAny \nYes or No \nPD \nAny \nPD \nYes or No \nPD \nAny \nAny \nYes \nPD \n \n* In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a \nminimum \n \nFinal,  22 Jan 2010 \nBI Trial No.: \n \nTrial Protocol \nPage \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim\n1200.34\n105\nTITLE PAGE \n \nABCD \nClinical Trial Protocol Amendment \nDoc.

These results also indicate that an effect \nof potent P-gp inducers on the PK characteristics of BIBW 2992 cannot be excluded. \nTo ensure continued subject safety, the following amendment have been made \nin the protocol: \n1.

The use of potent P-gp inhibitors (including Cyclosporin, \nErythromycin, Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Quinidine, Phenobarbital salt with Quinidine, \nRitonavir, Valspodar, Verapamil) and potent P-gp inducers (including St John's wort, \nrifampicin) must be avoided during treatment with BIBW 2992. Any exemptions to this must \nbe discussed with the BI clinical monitor. \nIn any patient ongoing in the trial receiving BIBW 2992 and a concomitant potent P-gp \ninhibitor or inducer at the time of amendment 1 being implemented, the decision for \ncontinuation of either drug will be based on the individual circumstances of the patient upon \ndiscussion with the responsible BI clinical monitor. \nReason For Change 2: \nThe restriction was added based on the results of a phase 1 trial 1200.79 performed in healthy \nvolunteers. Since BIBW 2992 is a P-gp substrate, BI performed this trial to assess the effects \nof the potent P-gp inhibitor ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIBW 2992. \nIn this open-label, randomised, two-way crossover study the relative exposure after a single \noral dose of BIBW 2992 (20 mg), co-administered with multiple oral doses of ritonavir (200 \nmg bid for 3 days), was compared to the exposure after a single oral dose of BIBW 2992 (20 \nmg) alone in healthy male volunteers. The study was designed to determine the maximum \neffect of P-gp inhibition on the PK of BIBW 2992. \nThe initial results of the study show that, although the median tmax and terminal half-life of \nBIBW 2992 were not affected, the rate and extent of absorption of BIBW 2992 was increased \nby co-treatment with ritonavir. The exposure to BIBW 2992, when taken in combination with \nritonavir (AUC0-\u221e, AUC0-tz and Cmax), increased by 50.0%, 47.6%, and 38.5%, respectively \n(Data on file). \nThese results also indicate that an effect of potent P-gp inducers on the PK characteristics of \nBIBW 2992 cannot be excluded. \nThe data in trial 1200.79 were obtained at a dose of 20 mg BIBW 2992. It is currently unclear \nwhether the results can be extrapolated to higher doses of BIBW 2992 currently used in phase \nII/III trials. However, considering the dose dependence of adverse events and for safety \nreasons caution has to be exercised in combining BIBW 2992 with potent P-gp inhibitors and \ninducers. \nIn addition guidance for management of patients who already receive BIBW 2992 in \ncombination with Pgp-inhibitors and Pgp-inducers was provided, as in these patients careful \nBoehringer Ingelheim \nFinal, 14 May 2010 \nBI Trial No.: 1200.34           Protocol amendment 1 \nPage 4 of 4 \n \nrisk-benefit assessment of the individual case may need to be performed upon discussion with \nthe responsible BI clinical monitor. \nThis is reflected by the modification of an exclusion criterion to all ongoing trials (Change 1), \nand the addition of restrictions for concomitant medications to be given together with BIBW \n2992 ( Change 2). \nTITLE PAGE \n \nABCD \nClinical Trial Protocol Amendment \nDoc.

For ease of \ninterpretation, a linear transformation will be used to standardise the raw scores of all items \nand scales, so that scores range from 0 to 100 (R07-2064). A higher score represents a higher \n(\u2018better\u2019) level of functioning (functional scales, global health status/QOL), or a higher \n(\u2018worse\u2019) level of symptoms (symptom scale/item) (R07-2064). \n \nTime to deterioration for the cough, dyspnoea, pain and symptom scales/items will be defined \nas the time to a 10-point increase from the baseline score (R07-2064, R99-1223, R07-2061). \nPatients who die before deteriorating will be analysed as having deteriorated at the time of \ndeath.

In addition, the three alternative measures of \npain (Questions 10-12* in QLQ-LC13) will be examined descriptively for consistency with \nthe composite of questions 9 and 19 from the QLQ-C30, as will dyspnoea (Question 8) from \nthe EORTC QLQ-C30 be compared with the dyspnoea composite (Questions 3-5* on the \nQLQ-LC13). \n \nTime to deterioration will be analysed similarly to PFS i.e. log-rank test stratified by the \nstratification factors used at randomisation will be used to test for the effect of BIBW 2992. \nThe individual items of the symptom scales will be examined for consistency with the \ncomposites. \n \nIn addition, a comprehensive analysis of all subscales/items (where a single item is scored, \nR07-2064) will estimate the hazard ratio for time to deterioration with 95% confidence. The \nresults of these analyses will be displayed using a Forest plot to summarise the impact of \ntherapy over the entire profile of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 measures. \n \nAdditional analysis will describe the distribution of patients that are improved, stable, or \nworsened for each of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 summary scales and items (where a \nsingle item is scored, R07-2061). \n \n * Note that questions on the QLQ-LC13 are numbered consecutively following the QLQ-C30 \nas shown in Appendix 4.

If the measurable \ndisease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by \ncytology/histology. \nNon-measurable disease \nNon-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 \nmm with CT scan, MRI or caliper measurement or <20 mm with chest X-ray or pathological \nlymph nodes with shortest axis \u226510 and <15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. \nLesions considered truly unmeasurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or \npericardial effusion, and inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or \nlung, abdominal masses / abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not \nmeasurable by reproducible imaging techniques. \nNew lesions in irradiated fields \nPreviously irradiated lesions should not be used as indicator lesions. However, new lesions \noccurring in previously irradiated fields can be used to assess the antitumour response. \nMethods of measurement \nAll measurements must be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline \nevaluations must be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than \n4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. If a lesion is considered too small to measure, a \ndefault measurement of 5mm should be applied. If the lesion is not visible, a default \nmeasurement of 0mm should be applied. \nThe same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterise each \nidentified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. \nClinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin \nnodules, palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by colour \nphotography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is obligatory. \nBoehringer Ingelheim \n          Final, 9 May 2011 \nBI Trial No.: 1200.34                              Protocol amendment 2                                     Page 23 of 30 \nCT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target \nlesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed \nwith cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed \nusing a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to the chest, abdomen and \npelvis. \nUltrasound, endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to measure tumour lesions or \nevaluate tumour response. However, these techniques can be useful to supplement information \nfrom other techniques. \nTumour markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the \nupper normal limit, they must normalise for a patient to be considered in complete clinical \nresponse. \nCytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for \nexample, residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, where known residual \nbenign tumours can remain). \nBaseline Documentation of Target and Non-target Lesions \nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, \nrepresentative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be \nrecorded, measured (longest diameter = LD) and numbered at baseline. Target lesions should \nbe selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability \nfor accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). Lymph \nnodes must be \u226515mm in order to be considered as target lesions.  \nA sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the \nbaseline sum LD.

However, new lesions \noccurring in previously irradiated fields can be used to assess the antitumour response. \nMethods of measurement \nAll measurements must be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline \nevaluations must be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than \n4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. If a lesion is considered too small to measure, a \ndefault measurement of 5mm should be applied. If the lesion is not visible, a default \nmeasurement of 0mm should be applied. \nThe same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterise each \nidentified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. \nClinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin \nnodules, palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by colour \nphotography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is obligatory. \nCT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target \nlesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed \nwith cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed \nusing a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to the chest, abdomen and \npelvis. \nUltrasound, endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to measure tumour lesions or \nevaluate tumour response. However, these techniques can be useful to supplement information \nfrom other techniques. \nTumour markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the \nupper normal limit, they must normalise for a patient to be considered in complete clinical \nresponse. \nCytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for \nexample, residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, where known residual \nbenign tumours can remain). \nBaseline Documentation of Target and Non-target Lesions \nBoehringer Ingelheim \n          Final, 9 May 2011 \nBI Trial No.: 1200.34                              Protocol amendment 2                                     Page 28 of 30 \nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, \nrepresentative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be \nrecorded, measured (longest diameter = LD for all lesions except lymph node and shortest \ndiameter = ShD for lymph nodes) and numbered at baseline. Target lesions should be selected \non the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate \nrepetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). Lymph nodes must be \n\u226515mm in order to be considered as target lesions.  \nA sum of the diameters (SoD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the \nbaseline SoD. The baseline SoD will be used as reference to further characterise the objective \ntumour response of the measurable dimension of the disease (see Table 10.4:1). \nTable 10.4: 1 \nEvaluation of target lesions \nComplete Response \n(CR) \nDisappearance of all target lesions. \nPartial Response \n(PR) \nAt least a 30% decrease in the SoD of target lesions taking as \nreference the baseline SD. \nProgression (PD) \nAt least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesions taking as \nreference the smallest SoD recorded since the treatment started, \ntogether with an absolute increase in the SoD of at least 5mm. \nOR \nThe appearance of one or more new lesions. \nStable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, taking as reference \nthe baseline SoD, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as \nreference the smallest SoD since the treatment started. \n \nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also \nbe recorded at baseline.

In general, the patient\u2019s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of \nboth measurements and confirmation criteria (Table 10.4:3). \nPatients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment \nwithout objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as \n\u201csymptomatic deterioration\u201d.

Rash can be managed by a \nvariety of treatment options to relieve symptoms and reduce the rash.\nThe recommendations for management are as follows:\n\u2022\nGeneral/Prevention: strict sun protection; use of a sunscreen of Sun Protection Factor \n15 (SPF 15) or higher, preferably containing zinc oxide; use of a thick, alcohol-free \nemollient cream; avoid harsh detergents, avoid using a solarium.\n\u2022\nCTCAE Grade 1 rash: mild rash may not need treatment. However, if treatment is \nconsidered necessary, topical hydrocortisone (1% or 2.5%) cream and/or clindamycin \n1% gel can be used.\n\u2022\nCTCAE Grade 2 rash: relief from major symptoms caused by CTCAE Grade 2 skin-\nrelated adverse events should be achieved by a combination of local and systemic \ntherapies including:\n1) Systemic antibiotics (doxycycline or minocycline etc.).\n2) Topical treatment (hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, clindamycin 1% gel, pimecrolimus \n1% cream).\nAnd / or\n1) Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, etc.)\n2) Oral prednisone (short term i.e., <14 days treatment) may be added at investigator\u2019s \ndiscretion.\nSystemic and topical treatment should be initiated at the start of CTCAE Grade 2 rash \nand continue until improvement or resolution to CTCAE Grade \u22641. If grade 2 rash \npersists for \u2265 7 days despite treatment and is poorly tolerated by the patient, the \ninvestigator may choose to pause treatment for up to 14 days followed by a reduction in \nthe dose of BIBW 2992 according to the dose reduction scheme in Table 4.1.4.1.1:1.\n\u2022\nCTCAE Grade 3 (or greater) rash: may be treated in a manner similar to CTCAE \nGrade 2 rash. In the event of CTCAE Grade \u22653 rash, treatment with BIBW 2992 should \nbe paused until recovery to CTCAE Grade \u22641. Treatment should be resumed at a reduced \ndose (see Section 4.1.4.1).

Although usually mild to moderate, diarrhoea may lead to dehydration and compel \ntreatment modification or discontinuation, so early management is essential (Table 4.4.1: 1). \nAt the time of initiation of treatment with afatinib patients should be given a supply of \nloperamide to keep with them at all times or access to loperamide should be confirmed; and \npatients should be counselled on the appropriate use. \nPatients must be advised to drink an adequate amount of fluids to make up for the fluid lost \nthrough diarrhoea. \nTable 4.4.1: 1 Grade specific treatment recommendations for afatinib related diarrhoea \nSeverity \n(CTCAE Grading)\nDescription \nIntervention \nconcerning afatinib\ntreatment\nSpecific intervention\nMild (Grade 1)\nIncrease of < 4 stools per \nday over baseline; mild \nincrease in ostomy output \ncompared with baseline\nContinue same dose\nStop laxatives and advise \npatient to drink at least 8-10 \nglasses of water of clear fluids \nper day;\n4 mg (2 tablets) of loperamide \nto be taken immediately, \nfollowed by 2 mg (1 tablet) \nafter each loose stool until \nbowel movements cease for 12 \nhours\nModerate (Grade 2)\nIncrease of 4-6 stools per \nday over baseline; i.v. \nfluids indicated < 24 \nhours; moderate increase \nin ostomy output \ncompared with baseline; \nnot interfering with ADL\nContinue same dose \nunless Grade 2 \ndiarrhoea continues for\n\u22652 days (48 hours) in \nwhich case treatment \nmust be interrupted \nuntil recovered to \u2264\nGrade 1 followed by \ndose reduction\nContinue loperamide; \nassess for dehydration and \nelectrolyte imbalance;\nconsider IV fluids and \nelectrolyte replacement \nSevere (Grade 3) \nIncrease of \u22657 stools per \nday over baseline; \nincontinence; IV fluids > \n24 hours; hospitalization; \nsevere increase in ostomy \noutput compared with \nbaseline; interfering with \nADL\nDose interruption until \nrecovered to \u2264Grade 1 \nfollowed by dose \nreduction*\nSee Grade 2; plus:\nan infectious process should be \nruled out with stool cultures; \naggressive iv fluid replacement \n\u2265 24 hours; hospitalization to \nmonitor progress;\nconsider prophylactic \nantibiotics if patient is also \nneutropenic; \nLife threatening \nLife-threatening \nconsequences (e.g. \nDose interruption until \nrecovered to \u2264Grade 1 \nSee Grade 3\nBoehringer Ingelheim\nFinal, 16 Oct 2013\nBI Trial No.: 1200.34 Protocol amendment 4                                                                Page 20 of 38\n(Grade 4)\nhaemodynamic collapse) \nfollowed by dose \nreduction*\n* If despite optimal supportive care and a treatment interruption, diarrhoea does not resolve to CTC AE Grade \u2264 \n1 within 14 days, treatment with afatinib must be permanently discontinued.

General \nrecommendations for prophylaxis are summarized in Table 4.4.2: 1 and grade-specific \ntreatment recommendations are summarized in Table 4.4.2: 2. For dose adjustment of afatinib \nrefer to Table 4.1.4.1.1:1.  \nSpecific interventions should be reassessed at least after 2 weeks or at any worsening of \nsymptoms, in which case the specific intervention should be adjusted and, depending on own \nclinical experience, early involvement of a dermatologist should be considered. (Adapted \nfrom R11-0826)\nTable 4.4.2: 1  General recommendations for prophylaxis while receiving afatinib\nPersonal hygiene\nUse of gentle soaps and shampoos for the body, e.g. pH5 neutral bath and \nshower formulations and tepid water.\nUse of very mild shampoos for hair wash.\nOnly clean and smooth towels are recommended because of potential risk of \ninfection. The skin should be patted dry after a shower, whereas rubbing the skin \ndry should be avoided.\nFine cotton clothes should be worn instead of synthetic material.\nShaving has to be done very carefully.\nManicure, i.e. cutting of nails, should be done straight across until the nails no \nlonger extend over the fingers or toes. Cuticles are not allowed to be trimmed \nbecause this procedure increases the risk of nail bed infections\nSun protection\nSunscreen should be applied daily to exposed skin areas regardless of season. \nHypoallergenic sunscreen with a high SPF (at least SPF30, PAPA free, \nUVA/UVB protection), preferably broad spectrum containing zinc oxide or \ntitanium dioxide are recommended\nPatients should be encouraged to consequently stay out of the sun.\nProtective clothing for sun protection and wearing a hat should be recommended.\nMoisturizer treatment\nIt is important to moisturize the skin as soon as anti-EGFR therapy is started.\nHypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointments and emollients should be used \nonce daily to smooth the skin and to prevent and alleviate skin dryness. \nNote: avoid greasy creams (e.g. petrolatum, soft paraffin, mineral oil based) and \ntopical acne medications\nPrevention of paronychia \nPatients should keep their hands dry and out of water if ever possible.\nThey should avoid friction and pressure on the nail fold as well as picking or \nmanipulating the nail.\nTopical application of petrolatum is recommended around the nails due to its \nlubricant and smoothing effect on the skin.\nTable 4.4.2: 2 Grade specific treatment recommendations of skin reactions to afatinib\nBoehringer Ingelheim\nFinal, 16 Oct 2013\nBI Trial No.: 1200.34 Protocol amendment 4                                                                Page 21 of 38\nSeverity \n(CTCAE Grading)\nDescription\nSpecific intervention\nACNEIFORM RASH\nMild (Grade 1)\nMacular or papular eruptions or \nerythema without associated \nsymptoms\nConsider topical antibiotics, e.g. \nclindamycin 2% or topical erythromycin 1% \ncream of metronidazole 0.75% or topical \nnadifloxacin 1%;\nIsolated scattered lesion: cream preferred\nMultiple scattered areas: lotion preferred\nModerate (Grade 2)\nMacular or papular eruptions with \npruritus or other associated \nsymptoms; localized desquamation \nor other lesions covering <50% of \nBSA \nTopical treatment as for Grade 1 \nplus short term topical steroids, e.g. \nprednicarbate cream 0.02% plus\nan oral antibiotic (for at least 2 weeks) e.g. \nDoxycycline 100mg b.i.d. or Minocycline \nhydrochloride 100mg b.i.d\nSevere (Grade 3)\nSevere, generalized erythroderma or \nmacular, popular or vesicular \neruption; desquamation covering \u2265 \n50% of BSA; associated with pain, \ndisfigurement, ulceration or \ndesquamation\nTopical and systemic treatment as for   \nGrade 2.\nConsider referral to dermatologist\nConsider systemic steroids\nLife threatening \n(Grade 4)\nGeneralized exfoliative, ulcerative, \nor bullous dermatitis\nSee Grade 3\nSystemic steroids are recommended\nEARLY AND LATE XEROTIC SKIN REACTIONS - PRURITUS\nMild (Grade 1)\nMild or localized\nTopical polidocanol cream.\nConsider oral antihistamines, e.g. \ndiphenhydramine, dimethindene, cetirizine, \nlevocetirizine, desloratidine, fexofenadine \nor clemastine)\nModerate (Grade 2)\nIntense or widespread\nSee Grade 1 plus oral antihistamines;\nConsider topical steroids, e.g. topical \nhydrocortisone\nSevere (Grade 3)\nIntense or widespread and interfering \nwith activities of daily living (ADL)\nSee Grade 2.\nXEROSIS (DRY SKIN)\nMild (Grade 1)\nAsymptomatic\nSoap-free shower gel and/or bath oil.\nAvoid alcoholic solutions and soaps.\nUrea- or glycerin-based moisturizer.\nIn inflammatory lesions consider topical \nsteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone cream)\nModerate (Grade 2)\nSymptomatic, not interfering with \nADL\nSee Grade 1.\nIn inflammatory lesions consider topical \nsteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone cream)\nSevere (Grade 3)\nSymptomatic,\ninterfering with ADL\nSee Grade 2.\nTopical steroids of higher potency (e.g. \nprednicarbate, mometasone furoate)\nConsider oral antibiotics\nFISSURES\nBoehringer Ingelheim\nFinal, 16 Oct 2013\nBI Trial No.: 1200.34 Protocol amendment 4                                                                Page 22 of 38\nMild (Grade 1)\nAsymptomatic\nPetroleum jelly, Vaseline\u00ae or Aquaphor for \n30 minutes under plastic occlusion every \nnight, followed by application of \nhydrocolloid dressing; antiseptic baths (e.g. \npotassium permanganate therapeutic baths, \nfinal concentration of 1:10,000, or \npovidone-iodine baths)\nTopical application of aqueous silver \nnitrate solutions to fissures\nModerate (Grade 2)\nSymptomatic, not interfering with \nADL\nSee Grade 1. \nConsider oral antibiotics.\nSevere (Grade 3)\nSymptomatic,\nInterfering with ADL\nSee Grade 2.\n1 If Grade 2 rash persists for \u22657 days despite treatment and is poorly tolerated by the patient, the investigator \nmay choose to pause treatment up to 14 days followed by a reduction in the dose of afatinib according to the \ndose reduction scheme in Table 4.1.4.1.1:1\n4.4.3\nManagement of mucositis/stomatitis\nGeneral and grade specific recommendations are described in Table 4.4.3:1. For dose \nadjustment refer to Section 4.1.4.1.1 and for restrictions on concomitant therapies refer to \nSections 4.2.2 and 10.7.\nTreatment is supportive and aimed at symptom control. These may include atraumatic \ncleansing and rinsing with non-alcoholic solutions such as normal saline, diluted salt and \nbaking soda solution (e.g. one-half teaspoonful of salt and one teaspoon of baking soda in one \nquart of water every four hours); avoidance of agents containing iodine, thyme derivatives \nand prolonged use of hydrogen peroxide; dietary modification such as promotion of soft, non \nirritating foods like ice-creams, mashed/cooked vegetables, potatoes and avoidance of spicy, \nacidic or irritating foods such as peppers, curries, chillies, nuts and alcohol. If the patient is \nunable to swallow foods or liquids, parenteral fluid and/or nutritional support may be needed. \nExamples of some of the agents suggested in Table 4.4.3:1 include: topical analgesics \u2013\nviscous lidocaine 2%; mucosal coating agents - topical kaolin/pectin; oral antacids, \nmaltodextrin, sucralfate; topical antifungals \u2013 nystatin suspension.
