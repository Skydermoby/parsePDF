Items on the questionnaire were selected to represent motor functions typically performed by children without motor impairments by 5 years of age.  Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (i.e., 0 = cannot do; 1 = initiates [< 10% of the task]; 2 = partially completes [10 to < 100 % of the task]; 3 = task completion, NT = not tested).  The score for each dimension is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension.  The total score is obtained by adding the percentage scores for each dimension and dividing the sum by the total number of dimensions.  Therefore, each dimension contributes equally to the total score. The Gross Motor Ability Estimator (GMAE), though mentioned in the protocol, will not be presented as it is not appropriate to use this scoring method that was validated with patients with cerebral palsy. It is an interval level measure where the subject is placed on an ability continuum from 0-100. The intervals are based on a movement analysis of children with cerebral palsy and we can\u2019t assume that the quality of movement or hierarchy of skill acquisition is similar for Pompe disease. ",

At the discretion of the Investigator, AEs that occurred after completion of the post-infusion observation period that were assessed as related could also be considered IARs.  As part of the safety review for infusion reactions, analyses including all AEs that occurred during or up to 2 hours post-infusion, regardless of relationship, will be performed.  To evaluate delayed onset infusion reactions, all post-infusion reactions occurring from 2 to 48 hours post-infusion, regardless of causality, will be classified by time period, e.g., reactions occurring 2 to 24 hours, 24 to 48 hours, and 2 to 48 hours overall post-infusion, and will then be subject to medical review to determine if the event was an infusion reaction.

Testing performed prior to informed consent is allowed, provided that written results are provided to the site.  If consent \nis provided, samples also will be obtained from the biological parent(s) at baseline. \n4 Pregnancy testing for female patients of childbearing potential will be repeated on Day 0 if this occurs >14 days after the baseline test.  Pregnancy test results must be obtained prior to starting the ITI \nregimen, and patients with positive test results will be excluded (or withdrawn) from the study. \n5 In addition to the scheduled physical examinations, brief, physical assessments should also be performed prior to the administration of any study medications (Myozyme and cyclophosphamide) to \nspecifically ensure that the patient is clinically stable and can tolerate administration of these agents. \n6 Results of the most recent laboratory tests (obtained on the day of the infusion) should be reviewed by Investigators prior to dosing with cyclophosphamide.  Results of the most recent immunoglobulin \npanel should also be reviewed prior to dosing. \n7 If a patient becomes anti-rhGAA (IgG) positive during the course of the study, he/she will also be tested every 2 months for the presence of inhibitory antibodies to Myozyme. \n8 Patients with cardiomegaly or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be admitted to the hospital for all cyclophosphamide infusions and will remain in the hospital for a minimum of 24 hours post-infusion. \n9 Patients should be well-hydrated prior to cyclophosphamide administration, but the patients\u2019 cardiac status should be taken into account when determining appropriate amount of hydration. \n10 A visit window of \u00b17 days will be permitted for the Pompe PEDI, GMFM-88, and AIMS.  All remaining study assessments should be conducted at the indicated study visit during the ITI treatment \nmodule.  Eligible CRIM-negative patients will be followed for a minimum of 18 months on treatment or, if a patient is <6 months of age at the time of enrollment, until the patient is 2 years of age. \n11 All concomitant medications and therapies, including those given as prophylaxis or prior to an infusion, will be recorded in the eCRF. \nNote:  It is recommended that the Investigator monitor a patient\u2019s immunoglobulin levels and consider IVIG administration at a dose of 400 mg/kg, regardless of age, if indicated per the individual \nInvestigator\u2019s clinical discretion. \nKey:  AIMS=Alberta Infantile Motor Scale; BL=baseline/screening; CBC=complete blood count; CK=creatine kinase; CK-MB=creatine kinase \u2013 myocardial band; CRIM=cross-reacting immunologic \nmaterial; D=day; ECG= electrocardiogram; ECHO; echocardiogram; ELISPOT=enzyme-linked mmunosorbent spot [assay]; GAA=acid\uf020 \u03b1-glucosidase; GMFM-88=Gross Motor Function Measure-88; \nIgG=immunoglobulin G; IVIG=intravenous immunoglobulin; PEDI=Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory; rhGAA=Recombinant human acid \u03b1-glucosidase; W=week \n \n",

Pregnancy test results must be obtained prior to starting the ITI \nregimen, and patients with positive test results will be excluded (or withdrawn) from the study. \n5 In addition to the scheduled physical examinations, brief, physical assessments should also be performed prior to the administration of any study medications (Myozyme, methotrexate, or rituximab) to \nensure that the patient is clinically stable and can tolerate administration of these agents. \n6 Results for the most recent laboratory tests (obtained the preceding day prior to initiating the Myozyme infusion) should be reviewed by Investigators prior to dosing with rituximab and methotrexate.  \nResults of the most recent immunoglobulin panel should also be reviewed prior to dosing. \n7 If a patient becomes anti-rhGAA (IgG) positive during the course of the study, he/she will also be tested every 2 months for the presence of inhibitory antibodies to Myozyme. \n8 Patients with cardiomegaly or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be admitted to the hospital for all cyclophosphamide infusions and will remain in the hospital for a minimum of 24 hours post-infusion. \n9 Patients will be admitted to the hospital for all rituximab infusions and will remain in the hospital for a minimum of 24 hours post-infusion.  Telemetry will be performed during all rituximab infusions \nfrom at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the infusion until at least 2 hours post-infusion. \n10 An optional, additional 4-week cycle of rituximab (up to 4 additional doses) may be administered as described in Protocol Section 8.1.  This additional cycle must be completed within the first 6 \nmonths of the study. \n11 Pre-infusion medication may be given as per rituximab treatment guidelines. \n12 Patients should be well-hydrated prior to methotrexate administration, but the patients\u2019 cardiac status should be taken into account when determining appropriate amount of hydration. \n13 Folinic acid supplementation may be given at the discretion of the Investigator beginning 24 hours after the dose of methotrexate. \n14 A visit window of \u00b17 days will be permitted for the Pompe PEDI, GMFM-66, and AIMS.  All remaining study assessments should be conducted at the indicated study visit during the ITI treatment \nmodule.  Eligible CRIM-negative patients will be followed for a minimum of 18 months on treatment or, if a patient is <6 months of age at the time of enrollment, until the patient is 2 years of age. \n15 All concomitant medications and therapies, including those given as prophylaxis or prior to an infusion, will be recorded in the eCRF. \nNote:  It is recommended that the Investigator monitor a patient\u2019s immunoglobulin levels and consider IVIG administration at a dose of 400 mg/kg, regardless of age, if indicated per the individual \nMyozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) \n \nProprietary and Confidential \n33/ 39 \nInvestigator\u2019s clinical discretion. \nKey:  AIMS=Alberta Infantile Motor Scale; BL=baseline/screening; CBC=complete blood count; CK=creatine kinase; CK-MB=creatine kinase \u2013 myocardial band; CRIM=cross-reacting immunologic \nmaterial; D=day; ECG= electrocardiogram; ECHO; echocardiogram; ELISPOT=enzyme-linked \ufffdmmunosorbent spot [assay]; GAA=acid \uf020\u03b1-glucosidase; GMFM-88=Gross Motor Function Measure-88; \nIgG=immunoglobulin G; IVIG=intravenous immunoglobulin; PEDI=Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory; rhGAA=Recombinant human acid \u03b1-glucosidase; W=week \n \n \n",

For Myozyme infusions, the visit window is \u00b11 week. \n2 Patients who are <2 years of age at their W73 visit should continue in the study until they reach their second (i.e., 2 years of age) birthday.  Therefore, these patients should repeat the Schedule of \nAssessments at W25 and continue following the protocol until they reach this birthday (W75 visit will mimic W25 assessments, W77 visit will mimic W27 assessments, etc.).  At the patient\u2019s second \nbirthday visit, all End-of-Study (EOS) assessments should be performed for study completion.  See Protocol Appendix 14.6. For further details. \n3 In addition to the scheduled physical examinations, brief, physical assessments should also be performed prior to the administration of any study medications (Myozyme) to ensure that the patient is \nclinically stable and can tolerate administration of these agents. \n4 Pregnancy testing will be performed monthly for female patients of childbearing potential, and patients with positive test results will be withdrawn from the study. \n5 If a patient becomes anti-rhGAA (IgG) positive during the course of the study, he/she will also be tested every 2 months for the presence of inhibitory antibodies to Myozyme. \nKey:  AIMS=Alberta Infantile Motor Scale; CBC=complete blood count; CK=creatine kinase; CK-MB=creatine kinase \u2013 myocardial band; D=day; ECG=electrocardiogram; ECHO; echocardiogram; \nELISPOT=enzyme-linked \ufffdmmunosorbent spot [assay]; EOS=End-of-Study; GMFM-88=Gross Motor Function Measure-88; IgG=immunoglobulin G; IVIG=intravenous immunoglobulin; \nPEDI=Pediatric Evaluation and Disability Inventory; rhGAA=Recombinant human acid \u03b1-glucosidase; W=week \n",
