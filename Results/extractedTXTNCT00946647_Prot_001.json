                "Title": "Amendment 5 (18-Nov-2016)",
                "Content": "Amendment rationaleThe CLBH589H2101 study started in December 2009 as a phase Ib dose escalation study of oral panobinostat in combination with 5-Azacitidine (5-Aza). The study was amended to a phase Ib/IIb with a randomized, two-arm, open-label design, adding an active control arm with single agent 5-Aza, with the first patient randomized on 19-March-2012. An interim Clinical Study Report (CSR) was planned, using a cut-off date corresponding to the time when the last patient enrolled in the phase IIb part had completed 12 months of treatment. The corresponding cut-off date was reached on 30-Apr-2014, an interim database lock took place on 30-Oct-2014, and an interim CSR was released on 7-May-2015. At the time of the cut-off date (30-Apr-2014), 17 patients were still on treatment, 4 in the phase Ib and 13 in the phase IIb. As of 01-May-2014, the schedule assessment was changed (as pre-specified in the protocol), leaving the efficacy-related assessments involving aspirate and biopsy samples at the discretion of the investigators.The results described in the interim CSR suggested an unfavorable benefit/risk profile of the dose and schedule of panobinostat in combination with 5-Aza in this patient population.However, some patients appear to derive benefit from their treatment, based on investigators assessment, and seven of them are still on treatment. The rationale of this amendment 5 is to ensure treatment access for these patients with a limited data collection. Therefore, for the patients ongoing treatment the study will focus on collecting continuously Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, Concomitant Medications, and Dose Administration Records information. In addition, information (date and reason) related to End of Treatment and Study Evaluation Completion, date of disease progression as well as Survival information must be provided. All other assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigators. To align with the most up-to-date protocol template, the sections 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of the protocol have been updated. The Inform Consent was also updated according to the updated template. Furthermore, and in order to align with program level standard language, the pregnancy prevention information will be implemented at the same time as this protocol amendment 5, by means of update of the Informed Consent.As of this amendment 5 there are 7 patients on treatment, one in the phase Ib and 6 in the phase IIb part of the study. The detailed changes to the protocol are listed below.Changes to the protocolThe changes that are made to the protocol are listed below and integrated directly in the protocol with track changes using

                "Content": "The CLBH589H2101 study started in December 2009 as a phase Ib dose escalation study of oral panobinostat in combination with 5-Aza. In October 2011, after the determination of the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) at 30 mg, the study was recently amended to a phase Ib/IIb study with a randomized, two-arm, open-label design, adding an active control arm with single agent 5-Aza. As of this amendment 5 patients are ongoing from the phase Ib part and the first patient was randomized into the phase IIb part on 19 March 2012. It is planned to enroll a total of 80 patients into the phase IIb part.Amendment rationaleThis amendment 3 is a global amendment to provide guidance on dose adjustments for panobinostat and/or 5-Aza in the event of hematological toxicity, in particular thrombocytopenia and neutropenia as well as in the event of non-hematological toxicity for patients enrolled in the phase IIb part. In the Phase I portion of this study dose modifications were guided by DLT definitions (Section 6.6.1.6).  In the Phase II portion, these toxicities are no longer captured as DLTs. A global amendment was necessary to ensure optimal risk management for patients with toxicities and keeping the dose adjustments consistent across sites, avoiding any ambiguity at the end of the study with overall patient drug exposure.For hematological toxicities, managing grade 3-4 cytopenias with optimal hematological support is necessary to maximize patient exposure to 5-aza and panobinostat.  Following optimal hematological support, dose modifications may become necessary to help patients tolerate study treatment.  For the non-hematological toxicities the approach was to manage these patients as per the 5-aza label and in keeping with current clinical practice.  This helps to maintain patient exposure to 5-aza which has been shown to improve outcomes.Rationale for other changes in the protocol and the Informed Consent Form for phase IIb part:Additional editorial corrections were needed in order to provide clarifications, to increase consistency within the protocol as well as with the Case Report Form (CRF), to harmonize with the Novartis Guidance on the Prevention of Pregnancies in Participants in Clinical Trialsand to rectify typographical errors throughout. \uf0b7To harmonize eligibility of patients with current LBH protocols, Inclusion criteria #6 which defines eligibility of euthyroid patients\u2019 will be clarified by removing any mention of supplementation to avoid previous ambiguity. \uf0b7To provide clarification around IRT procedures.\uf0b7To provide clarification on dose adjustments in Phase II.

                "Title": "Amendment 2 (released on 24 October 2011)",
                "Content": "The purpose of Amendment 2 is to:\uf0b7Collect preliminary efficacy data of panobinostat at the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) level in conjunction with azacytidine (5-Aza/Vidaza\u00ae) by introducing a randomized, two-arm, open-label expansion phase, which determines the phase IIb part of the study. \uf0b7Revise the eligibility criteria based on new safety information and current clinical practice.\uf0b7Update the ECG safety monitoring schedule according to the current LBH589 cardiac safety profile.\uf0b7Align the protocol with the current LBH589 guidance on the use of concomitant medications (as specified in the post-text supplement 3).As of this amendment, the phase Ib part of this study is completed and the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) was established at 30 mg of oral panobinostat once daily on day 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15 in combination with azacytidine (5-Aza/Vidaza\u00ae). In total, 31 patients were enrolled in the phase lb part. Eighteen patients were treated at the dose level of 30 mg of panobinostat, 16 of which were evaluable for the MTD determining set. Dose escalation was not continued up to the MTD because of long term tolerability considerations.Rationale for the phase IIb part\uf0b7This amendment introduces a randomized phase IIb part with an active control arm so that the preliminary efficacy of panobinostat at the RPIID level in combination with 5-Aza versus 5-Aza alone can be rigorously studied. The most important advantage of proper randomization is that it minimizes allocation bias and the use of an active treatment comparator overcomes several limitations of a historical comparator, e.g., treatment arms can be balanced adequately with respect to both known and unknown prognostic factors and the confounding effect of imbalances in prior treatment can be controlled. \uf0b7Based on the Phase III AZA-001 study data (Fenaux et al 2009a), low response rates have been shown with 5-Aza alone. Assuming an increase in CR response rates can be achieved with the combination over the low rates seen with single-agent 5-Aza, CR including CRi for AML patients and bone marrow CR for MDS/CMML patients have been selected as primary efficacy endpoints in the phase IIb part.Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 21\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\n\uf0b7\nThis randomized phase II part allows collecting safety data of panobinostat in combination \nwith 5-Aza in comparison to single-agent 5-aza. In addition, it allows to better understand \nthe degree of tolerability wherefore safety and tolerability have been selected as secondary \nendpoints in the phase IIb part. \n \n\uf0b7\nData from the phase III AZA-001 study shows that 90% of the study population achieved \na best response by Cycle 9 (Fenaux 2009b).  The core clinical study report (encompassing \nboth, the phase Ib and the phase IIb part of the study) will be based on a data cut-off \ncorresponding to the time point where all patients have either completed 12 cycles of \nstudy treatment or discontinued study treatment for any other reason, whichever comes \nfirst. An addendum to the core clinical study report will be provided at the completion of \nthe study to summarize and/or list the additional safety and efficacy data as appropriate. \nPatients who have completed 12 cycles of study treatment and are assessed by the \nInvestigator to have the potential to benefit from ongoing treatment will continue their \nassigned treatment allowing the collection and assessment of safety, efficacy and survival \ndata. After the data-cut off point for the CSR a reduced assessment schedule will be \napplied.\n\uf0b7\nClinical response, the primary efficacy endpoint in the phase IIb part, is assessed by \nchanges in bone marrow and peripheral blood blast percentages based on standardized \nresponse criteria proposed by Cheson et al. 2003 and 2006 (as specified in the post-text \nsupplement 1). The proposed open label study design is not likely to impact the objective \ndetermination of response based on the Cheson criteria.\nRationale for protocol adjustments related to eligibility criteria, cardiac \nassessments, ECG monitoring schedule and the current LBH589 guidance on \nthe use of concomitant medications \n\uf0b7\nInclusion criterion #4 which defines patients\u2019 eligibility according to INR and PTT \nlaboratory parameter has been replaced with a criterion based on evidence of clinically \nsignificant mucosal or internal bleeding. The new criterion reflects more closely clinical \npractice and is aligned with newer AML protocols.\n\uf0b7\nDue to limited data about the effect of myelosuppression caused by panobinostat, in \nparticular thrombocytopenia, the eligibility criterion based on INR/PTT laboratory values \nwas defined at the time of the original protocol. New safety information with regards to \nthrombocytopenia showed that irrespective of new or worsening grade 3/4 \nthrombocytopenia, the incidence of grade 3/4 bleeding events (regardless of causality) was \nlow and may be associated with baseline thrombocyte levels and other risk factors (tumor \ntypes, metastases). We recommend that patients who require chronic anticoagulation \ntherapy at study entry or while on panobinostat therapy use low molecular weight heparin \n(LMWH).  However, if the use of LMWH is not feasible, such patients may continue on \nsodium warfarin while on panobinostat, but a close monitoring of common coagulation \nparameters, including a PTT/INR should be conducted.  Coagulation parameters at study \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 22\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\nentry and during the course of the study should be maintained within a therapeutic range \nas appropriate for the indication.\n\uf0b7\nDuring the course of this trial four grade 3 bleeding events of hemoptysis and recurrent \nbleeding in the oral cavity, intracerebral bleeding, and acute GI bleeding were reported in \nthree patients (30 mg dose cohorts). Hemoptysis and recurrent bleeding in the oral cavity \nas well as intracerebral bleeding were not suspected to be related to panobinostat. For the \nacute GI bleeding event a possible relation with the study treatment was reported. \nHowever, confounding factors were confirmed by the investigator as the GI bleed was \nidentified to originate from internal hemorrhoids and deemed to be secondary to Grade 4 \nthrombocytopenia. All patients entered the trial with grade 3 thrombocyte counts which \nworsened to grade 4 on day 8 of the first cycle but were manageable with platelet \ntransfusions. All events resolved within 3 days and none of the events were considered life \nthreatening or required study drug adjustments.\n\uf0b7\nMUGA has been added as another validated method to assess cardiac function.  Both, \nECHO (echocardiogram) and MUGA (multiple gated acquisitions) scan are widely \napplied methods, used to monitor cardiac function in clinical practice and therapy-induced \ncardio-toxicity in clinical trials (e.g., with anthracyclines).\n\uf0b7\nThe ECG safety monitoring schedule has been updated according to the current LBH589 \ncardiac safety profile. This is based on an integrated analysis of completed and ongoing \nstudies using oral panobinostat showing minimal risk of QT prolongation with no \nclinically significant QTc interval changes. It also showed that the risk of QTc \nprolongations does not increase over time when oral panobinostat is dosed up to 40 mg \nthree times a week (TIW) every week or 45 mg TIW every other week.  An integrated \nanalysis was performed on the pooled centrally reviewed ECG data collected from three \nPhase I and six Phase II studies of single-agent oral panobinostat in 559 patients with \nadvanced hematologic malignancies or solid tumors (Weber et al 2009).  A total of 554 \npatients had both a baseline and at least one post-baseline ECG measurement (a total of \n23.017 ECG assessments).  This analysis has shown that oral panobinostat monotherapy at \ndoses up to 40 mg TIW weekly and 45 mg TIW every other week was safe and well \ntolerated with no clinically significant QTc interval changes observed.  Major outliers \n(QTcF >500 ms) were observed in two patients (less than 1 % of patients) up to doses of \n45 mg, and these sporadic cases were generally associated with significant comorbidities \n(e.g., underlying heart disease, hypertension, and severe electrolyte disturbances).  \nBaseline QTcF and age, but not dosing schedule, were identified as predictive factors for \nQT prolongation.  Significant mean and maximum QTcF interval changes were observed \nin Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 5 after the first and the third consecutive dose of panobinostat. \nBeyond Day 5, mean QTcF values showed a trend towards normalization compared with \nbaseline up to the completion of Cycle 2.\n\uf0b7\nWith a dosing interval of 48 hours and the specific dosing schedule in this protocol \n(panobinostat intake on days 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15), the ECG monitoring schedule was \nadjusted as follows: Cycle 1 Day 3 (first panobinostat dose), Days 8 and 12 (third and fifth \nconsecutive dose of panobinostat) as well as on Day 3 of Cycle 2 and all subsequent \ncycles. ECGs time points at screening and EOS visit did not change\n\uf0b7\nNo study-drug related prolonged QTcF has been observed in this study. Two grade 3 \nQTcF prolongation events have been reported, each one in the 30 mg or 40 mg \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 23\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\npanobinostat dose cohort; none of which was suspected to be related to the study treatment. \nOne occurred at C2D18 and the other at C1D26. The individual events resolved from \nseveral hours to approximately 2-3 days after their onset and required no actions with \nregards to the study treatment.\n\uf0b7\nWith this adjusted ECG monitoring schedule, patient safety will remain uncompromised \nwhile eliminating excessive tests that are inconvenient for patients.\n\uf0b7\nTo align with the current LBH589 guidance, the use of concomitant medications (as \nspecified in the post-text supplement 3) has been updated. The current LBH589 guidance \nprovides new information for the management of co-medications that prolong the QT \ninterval, are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or are CYP2D6 substrates. It also includes an \nupdated list of medications which was developed in collaboration with an external \ncardiology consultant and is based on the ARIZONA CERT website on drugs that prolong \nthe QT interval and/or induce Torsades de Pointes or ventricular arrhythmia \n(...azert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/drug-lists.cfm). Additional information from the two \ndrug-drug interaction studies [CLBH589B2110] and [CLBH589B2109] were incorporated. \n\uf0b7\nTo date, none of the patients enrolled in this trial were concomitantly treated with \ndolasetron mesylate which should no longer be used to prevent nausea and vomiting \nassociated with cancer chemotherapy in conjunction with panobinostat (LBH589). With \nregards to the medications (which have since been removed from the list of prohibited \nconcomitant medications), three protocol deviations with respect to the concomitant use of \naprepitant have been reported. \nRationale for other changes in this amendment: \nEditorial corrections were needed in order to provide clarifications, increase the consistency \nof the document and rectify typographical errors throughout.\n\uf0b7\nThe primary objective of the original protocol (specified as the primary objective of the \nphase Ib part in the proposed amendment) was clarified to indicate that the dose being \nselected to go forward with, in the phase IIb part, will be based on considerations of the \nMTD estimation process using the BLRM, and on an overall assessment of safety taking \ninto consideration long term tolerability data from subsequent cycles. The selected dose \nwhich would be referred to as the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) could be the same \nas the MTD but will not exceed it under any circumstance. This specification of the \nprimary objective is consistent with the description of the dose escalation procedure and \nthe statistical principles guiding it, in sections 6.7.1.4 and 10.1.4.2 of the protocol.\n \n\uf0b7\nTo provide clarifications on study procedures, time points, study visit terminology \n\uf0b7\nSection 7.1.8 including table 6-4 header has been rephrased to clarify that only QT \ninterval prolongation is excluded from the general guidance on dose adjustments for \nnon-hematological toxicities.  To date, two treatment-related cardiac toxicities \n(electrocardiogram T-wave inversion and atrial fibrillation and syncope) have been \nreported. With regards to the T-wave inversion, the study drug was interrupted for one \ndose (C1D15) and the patient continued the study without any dose adjustments after \nexclusion of a myocardial infarction and normalization of the electrocardiogram after \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 24\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\ntwo days. Due to the suspected study drug relationship both cases were considered a \nDLT.\n\uf0b7\nThe first visit (days -14 to -1) where screening activities are to be performed is \nindicated as \u2018baseline\u2019 visit.

Methods of gene inactivation include transcriptional silencing by hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene promoter regions and by hypoacetylation of chromatin preventing access of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators to promoter regions of genes. Reversal of these epigenetic processes results in up-regulation of genes that can reverse the malignant phenotype by a number of means including the induction of apoptosis and differentiation. Since these two processes are independent, but mechanistically related, the reversal of both processes can lead to greater gene transcription than the reversal of either one alone.5-Azacitidine (5-Aza) is a demethylating agent and has been approved by FDA for the treatment of patients with all FAB subtypes MDS and by EMEA for the treatment of patients with high-risk MDS, CMML and AML, not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Panobinostat is a deacetylase inhibitor (DACi) that has been investigated in patients with lymphoid and myeloid malignancies as well as solid tumors. It has shown single-agent activity in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and hematological disorders including HL, AML, MDS and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIM).Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the administration of a demethylator followed by a deacetylase inhibitor (DACi) leads to greater gene re-expression and apoptosis induction than either alone. Consequently, a number of clinical trials have been conducted by several groups using 5-Aza in combination with DACi agents such as phenylbutyrate, valproic acid, belinostat and vorinostat.Overall, this type of combined therapy appears to be not only safe, but has also shown a superior response rate compared to single agent epigenetic therapy, although this observation needs be confirmed in prospective randomized clinical trials. Of note is that slow onset of response, seen for single agent 5-Aza therapy in MDS, CMML and AML patients, appears to be accelerated by combining 5-Aza with DACi, with a median time to response of 1 course (range, 1 to 3 courses) in contrast with the 4 to 6 courses for single-agent 5-Aza. (Silverman et al 2008)The strong preclinical rationale, encouraging clinical activity of single agent panobinostat, as well as published data showing enhanced clinical activity by combining two epigenetic-modifying agents suggest that panobinostat and 5-Aza can be combined safely and be a therapeutic option of benefit for the patient.Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 28\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\nPurpose/rationale\nThe primary purpose of the phase Ib part of this study is to determine the \nmaximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RPIID) \nfor the panobinostat / 5-Aza drug combination in patients with MDS, CMML or \nAML.\nIn vitro, the combination of a hypomethylating agent and a DAC inhibitor have \nbeen shown to have a synergistic effect both in terms of leukemia cell killing, \nand also in terms of gene reactivation. Based on this concept, a number of \nearly clinical trials have been conducted by several groups using either 5-Aza \nin combination with agents such as phenylbutyrate (Gore 2006, Maslak 2006), \nMS-275, or valproic acid (Soriano et al 2007). All these studies have shown \npromising results compared to hypomethylating therapy alone and support a \ncombined epigenetic therapeutic approach.\nIt is expected that the combination of these two agents can be safely \nadministered and result in clinical benefit for the patients. As per registered \nlabel, 5-Aza is given subcutaneously (sc) for 1 week (Day 1-7). Panobinostat \nwill be administered intermittently (Day 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15) over 2 weeks \nin a 28-day cycle. \nIn the two-arm, randomized phase IIb part of the study patients will be treated \nwith panobinostat at the RPIID in combination with 5-Aza versus 5-Aza alone. \nThe schedule of the phase Ib part will be followed. The primary purpose is to \nassess preliminary efficacy of this new regimen and to further characterize \nsafety and tolerability.\nObjectives\nPhase Ib part\nPrimary objectives\n\uf0b7\nTo determine the MTD and/or RPIID of oral panobinostat in combination \nwith a fixed dose of 5-Aza in adult patients with MDS, CMML, or AML.\nSecondary objectives\n\uf0b7\nTo characterize the safety and tolerability of panobinostat in combination \nwith 5-Aza in the target patient populations\nAs of amendment 2, the primary objective of the phase Ib part has been met  \nand the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) has been determined to be \n30 mg of oral panobinostat once daily on day 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15 in \ncombination with 5-Aza as per the registered label (75mg/m2 on day 1-7). \nDose escalation was not continued up to the MTD because of long term \ntolerability considerations.\nPhase IIb part\nPrimary objective\n\uf0b7\nTo assess preliminary efficacy of treatment with the panobinostat and 5-\nAza combination at RPIID relative to treatment with single agent 5-Aza \nthrough the assessment of composite CR (CR or CRi or bone marrow \nCR).\nSecondary objectives\n\uf0b7\nTo assess preliminary efficacy of treatment with the panobinostat and 5-\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 29\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\nAza combination at RPIID relative to treatment with single agent 5-Aza \nthrough the assessment of clinical response other than the composite CR \nspecified in the primary objective, 1-year survival, and time to progression \n(TTP). \n\uf0b7\nTo characterize the safety and tolerability of panobinostat at RPIID in \ncombination with 5-AZA, as well as, 5-AZA alone in the target patient \npopulation.\n \n \nEndpoints (efficacy, \nsafety)\nPhase Ib part\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\uf0b7\nIncidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT)\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\uf0b7\nType, duration, frequency and relatedness of Adverse Events (AE).

The phase IIb part, that will commence once MTD \nand/or RPIID is established, has a randomized, two arm design and is \ndesigned to assess preliminary efficacy of panobinostat (in combination with \n5-Aza) at RPIID relative to 5-Aza alone, the current standard of care,\nIn the phase Ib part, escalating doses of oral panobinostat will be \nadministered in combination with the registered schedule of subcutaneous \n(sc) of 5-Aza (75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days). A minimum of three patients \nconstitutes a cohort for each dose level. During this iterative process the dose \nlimiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed after each cohort has completed Cycle \n1. In each subsequent cohort, patients will receive a dose of panobinostat \nguided by the Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control \n(EWOC) together with a standard dose of 5-Aza until the MTD and/or RPIID is \ndetermined.\nStarting dose of panobinostat will be 20 mg. At least 9 evaluable patients \nneed to be treated at a certain dose level before this dose can be declared to \nbe the MTD and/or RPIID. \nAs of August 2011, the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) was determined \nto be 30 mg of oral panobinostat once daily on day 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15 in \ncombination with azacytidine (5-Aza/Vidaza\u00ae).\nAdditional 80 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio into the phase \nIIb part of the study receiving 30 mg of panobinostat plus 5-Aza \n(investigational arm) or single agent 5-Aza (active control arm). Single agent \n5-Aza will be administered according to the registered label (75mg/m2 daily for \n7 days), \nPatients will continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable \ntoxicity or consent withdrawal, whichever comes first The core clinical study \nreport will be based on a data cut-off corresponding to the time point where all \npatients have either completed 12 cycles of study treatment or discontinued \nstudy treatment for any other reason whichever comes first. An addendum to \nthe core clinical study report (encompassing both phase Ib and phase IIb \nparts) will be provided at the completion of the study to summarize and/or list \nthe additional safety and efficacy data as appropriate. \nPatients who have completed 12 cycles of study treatment and are assessed \nby the Investigator to have the potential to benefit from ongoing treatment will \ncontinue their assigned treatment allowing collecting and reviewing safety, \nefficacy and survival data.

Instead, in the \nphase Ib part of the study, Novartis and the study investigators agree to \nconvene once each treatment cohort has completed (or earlier in case of \nDLT) to make decision on whether to escalate the dose any further, or \nwhether to de-escalate and/or expand recruitment into particular cohort/s. \nThis group will also decide when the MTD and/or RPIID for panobinostat in \ncombination with 5-Aza has been reached. In the phase IIb part a steering \ncommittee will be established.\nStatistical methods \nand data analysis\nPhase Ib part\nAn adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) for combination \ntherapy, including the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle will \nbe used to guide the dose escalation to determine the MTD of panobinostat in \ncombination with a fixed dose of 5-Aza. MTD will be assessed during the first \ntreatment cycle. Historical data of 5-Aza regimens as well as data from study \n[CLBH589B2102, arm X] for panobinostat were used to derive informative \npriors for the model parameters.\nEach cohort will consist of a minimum of 3 patients fully evaluable for therapy-\nrelated toxicities over the first cycle of treatment.\nA dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal \nlaboratory value occurring at any time and assessed as clinically relevant and \nis considered to be related to the study treatment, unrelated to disease, \ndisease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications. \nToxicities will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE, version 3.0.\nAfter each cohort of patients has completed the first cycle of treatment, the \nposterior distribution for the model parameters will be obtained by simulation. \nBased on the posterior distribution of all model parameters, the corresponding \nposterior distributions for probabilities of a DLT are obtained. Dose \nrecommendation within each part of the dose escalation will be based on \nposterior summaries for each dose combination including the mean, median, \nstandard deviation, 95%-credibility interval, and the interval probabilities for \nunder-dosing, targeted, excessive, and unacceptable toxicity.\nOnce updated, the distribution summarizes the probability that the true \nprobability of a DLT for each dose combination lies in one of the following \ncategories:\n[0%, 20%)\nunder-dosing\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 35\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\n[20%, 35%)\ntargeted toxicity\n[35%, 60%)\nexcessive toxicity\n[60%, 100%]\nunacceptable toxicity.\nFollowing the principle of escalation with overdose control, after each cohort \nof patients the recommended dose combination is the one with the highest \nposterior probability of DLT in the target interval [20%, 35%) among the doses \nfulfilling the overdose criteria: there is less than 25% chance of either \nexcessive or unacceptable toxicity.\nThe dose of panobinostat recommended by the adaptive BLRM may be \nregarded as information to be integrated with a clinical assessment of the \ntoxicity profiles observed thus far in determining the next dose to be \ninvestigated.\nAt least 9 evaluable patients are to be treated at a dose level to declare the \ndose as MTD and/or RPIID.\nThe recommended phase II dose (RPIID)  of panobinostat in combination with \na fixed dose of 5-Aza will be based on considerations of the  MTD estimation \nprocess  using  the BLRM, and on an overall assessment of safety taking into \nconsideration tolerability data from subsequent cycles.\nAll adverse events recorded during the study will be listed and summarized. \nAll serious adverse events will be listed by patients and tabulated by type of \nadverse event and initial dose level. Any other safety information will be listed \nand tabulated as appropriate.\nPhase IIb part\nThe planned sample size is 40 per arm, or in other words, 80 in total.  It is \ndeemed that an observed improvement of 50% in composite CR rate is \nclinically relevant in the phase llb part of the study.  Under the assumption that \nthe composite CR rate in the active control arm is 17% (estimate based on \nFenaux et al 2009a), the chance of observing a clinically relevant \nimprovement when there is actually no difference in the true composite CR \nrates between the arms is estimated to be 23% while the chance of not \nobserving a clinically relevant improvement when there is indeed a substantial \ndifference in the true composite CR rates (true composite response rate in \nexperimental arm is 35%) is estimated to be 19%.\nFor all safety analyses, the safety set will be used. For efficacy analyses, the \nfull analysis set (FAS) will be used. All listings and tables will be presented by \ntreatment arm (\u2018as treated\u2019 for the safety analyses, and \u2018as randomized\u2019 for \nthe efficacy analyses). \nEfficacy variables and endpoints\nThe primary efficacy endpoint will be the composite CR (CR or CRi or bone \nmarrow CR) among all patients in the FAS.\nThe following other efficacy endpoints will be considered as part of the \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 36\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\nsecondary efficacy analysis: \n\uf0b7\nClinical response for AML: PR; \n\uf0b7\nClinical response for MDS/CMML:PR and Hematologic Improvement (HI)\n\uf0b7\nOverall response (CR or CRi or bone marrow CR or PR)\n\uf0b7\n1-year survival rate\n\uf0b7\nTime to progression\nClinical responses will be summarized by treatment arm, overall and within \ndisease type (i.e. AML or MDS/CMML). Percentage rates for composite CR \n(CR or CRi or bone marrow CR) will be reported along with 95% confidence \nintervals for both arms. Exact binomial confidence interval (implemented using \nSAS procedure FREQ with EXACT statement for one-way tables) will be \ncalculated (Clopper and Pearson 1934). Point estimates and confidence \nintervals for the difference in rates between the treatment arms will also be\nreported. The 1-year survival rate will be obtained from the Kaplan-Meier \ncurve and its variance will be estimated by Greenwood\u2019s formula. Time to \nprogression will also be analyzed through Kaplan-Meier curves.\nSafety variables and analysis\nAll adverse events recorded during the study will be summarized by treatment \narm. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (new or worsening \nfrom baseline) will be summarized by body system, severity (based on \nCTCAE grades), type of adverse event, and relation to the study treatment. \nDeaths reportable as SAEs and non-fatal serious adverse events will be listed \nby patient, type of adverse event, and treatment arm.\nThe assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse \nevents, on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre-determined \nranges, and other safety data. \n",

The same regimen will be repeated in \nsubsequent cycles. As previously mentioned, the treatment cycle might be extended to 42 \ndays to allow for recovery from toxicity (Section 6.6.1.6)\nAccording to 5-Aza label, treatment should be continued as long as the patient continues to \nbenefit or until disease progression. It is also recommended that patients be treated for a \nminimum of 6 cycles. Accordingly, the present study stipulates that at least 3 or 4 cycles of \nthe combination 5-Aza and panobinostat should be given unless disease progression or \nunacceptable toxicity or patient\u2019s consent withdrawal are encountered. The rationale for this \nschedule and its duration is based on the following considerations:\n\uf0b7\nThere are preclinical evidences suggesting that sequential addition of DACi to cells \npreincubated with DNMTi synergistically reactivates the expression of genes silenced \nthrough promoter methylation (Cameron 1999, Zhu 2001).\n\uf0b7\nBased on this concept, a number of clinical trials have been conducted by several groups \nusing a sequential administration of 5-Aza followed by a DACi such as phenylbutyrate, \nvalproic acid, belinostat and vorinostat (Table 1-6). In all these studies, the DACi inhibitor \nwas delivered following 5-Aza. Two weeks of rest was part of the treatment cycle of 28 \ndays. With this therapeutic approach, evidences of clinical activity and a manageable \nsafety profile were consistently reported, being the most promising results observed with \nthe combination of 5-Aza with vorinostat (Silverman et al 2008). A similar therapeutic \napproach has been proposed in the present study.\n\uf0b7\nAlthough the approved dose and schedule of 5-Aza cause marrow hypoplasia in a limited \nnumber of patients (10%), 5-Aza remains a myelosuppressive agent and patients should be \nmonitored for fever, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. There is a greater risk of these \nevents occurring during the first two cycles with single agent 5-Aza, after which their \nfrequency is reduced in patients with restoration of hematological function. Mean times to \nnadir values (across all cycles) for hematological parameters, including absolute \nneutrophils and platelets, were between 15 and 16 days in the pivotal CALGB 9221 study \n",

The applied adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) provides a \nrecommendation for the highest dose level of panobinostat in combination with 5-Aza by the \ndose with maximum probability of targeted toxicity (probability of DLT between 20%-35%). \nThe use of escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle limits the risk of excessive or \nunacceptable toxicity (probability of DLT \u2265 35%) to less than 25% (for further details see \nSection 10.1.4.2 and [Post-text supplement 2]).\nIn order to be evaluable for the MTD determining set, patients of the safety set need to have \nreceived sufficient study treatment as defined in the minimum exposure criteria in cycle 1 \n(Table 10-1) and had sufficient safety evaluations or discontinued due to DLT in Cycle 1. \nPatients not experiencing DLT during Cycle 1 must have completed all safety assessments as \nrequested in the protocol during this treatment cycle and meet the minimum exposure criteria\nto be included in the MTD determining set. Patients who meet the minimum exposure criteria \nbut discontinue early (e.g., for disease progression) will be asked to have all scheduled safety \nevaluations performed as delineated in the protocol in order to remain evaluable for the MTD \ndetermining population. Patients who do not meet these minimum safety evaluation \nrequirements will be regarded as ineligible for the MTD-determining set and will be replaced.\nAt the end of each treatment cohort in the dose escalation part of the study, Novartis will \nconvene a teleconference with the investigators. At the dose escalation teleconference the \nclinical course (safety information including all DLTs and all \u2265 Grade 2 toxicity data during \nCycle 1 and ECG) for each patient in the current dose cohort will be described in detail. \nUpdated safety data on other ongoing patients, including data in later cycles, will be discussed \nas well. The final decision to dose escalate is not based solely on DLT information, but also \non a clinical interpretation of all the relevant toxicity (both DLT and non-DLT) using the \nBLRM's recommendation as a guideline to the decision making process. The maximum inter-\ncohort dose escalation permitted is 100%. In any case, the next dose will not exceed the \nrecommended dose by the BLRM. The parties must reach a consensus on whether to escalate \nthe dose any further, or whether to de-escalate or expand recruitment into particular cohorts. \nNovartis will prepare minutes from these meetings and circulate them within 24 hours to each \ninvestigator for comment prior to finalization. \nThe recommended phase II dose (RPIID) for panobinostat will be based on the overall \nassessment of the incidence of DLT of the first treatment cycle as provided by the adaptive \nBLRM in conjunction with safety data generated across treatment cycles at all tested dose \nlevels.\n6.6.1.5\nDose escalation\nDuring the phase Ib part of the study, a minimum of 3 patients will be assigned sequentially to \na cohort. A cohort consists of at least three patients eligible for the MTD determining set (see \nSection 10.1.1). Patients who are not eligible for the MTD determining set will be replaced. \nThe first patient of the first cohort will start study treatment at least one week before the next \npatients start study treatment.\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 63\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\nThe Bayesian model will be updated prior to additional enrollment under the following \nscenarios:\n1. If the first 2 patients in a cohort experience DLT prior to the enrollment of the 3rd patient. \nEnrollment will be halted, the model will be updated, and any new patients will be \nenrolled at a dose satisfying the overdose criteria, no higher than the current dose level.\n2. No additional patients will be enrolled until the current cohort is completed and the model \nis updated.\n3. For cohorts of > 3 patients if the observed number of DLTs exceeds 25% of the currently \nenrolled patients to that dose level, enrollment will be halted until all patients complete \none cycle of dosing or experience DLT. The model will be updated to determine the \nuncertainty about the probability of DLT at each dose level. New patients will be enrolled \nat a dose level up to the highest satisfying the overdose criteria.\nA decision will be jointly made by the investigators and the sponsor as to the dose level at \nwhich to continue dosing. \n6.6.1.6\nDose-limiting toxicities (For phase Ib portion only)\nThe DLT is defined as a toxicity requiring treatment withdrawal and includes the following:\n\uf0b7\nNon-hematologic toxicity qualifying for DLT: In all patients, any treatment emergent or \nnew NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity, attributable to study treatment \n(either drug in combination). Additionally, treatment-emergent or new Grade 2 peripheral \nneuropathy attributable to study treatment, customarily considered DLT in cancer clinical \nstudies.\n\uf0b7\nHematologic toxicity qualifying for DLT: In all patients NCI CTCAE Grade 4 life-\nthreatening febrile neutropenia. A special distinction between patients evaluable or not for \nhematologic toxicity has been made in this study, considering that the majority of patients \nrepresenting the target population will have pre-existing severe cytopenias.  Management \nof hematologic toxicity according to baseline blood count values is an integral part of the \nVidaza label and common clinical practice in these patient populations. To overcome \ncomplexity in implementing the Vidaza label algorithm, a more user-friendly approach \nbased on clinical experience has been used in this study protocol. Hematologic toxicity \nwill not be evaluable unless patients demonstrate baseline neutrophil counts > 0.5 x 109/L \nand platelet counts > 20 x 109/L. In these patients, failure to recover neutrophil and \nplatelet counts to equal or higher baseline levels AND the demonstration of persistent \nbone marrow hypoplasia (MH) (<10% overall cellularity and <5% blasts) on Day 42 of \nCycle 1 will be considered a hematologic DLT at that dose level (see Figure 6-3). On the \nother hand, if a patient with the previous baseline values of neutrophils and platelets, \nexperiences persisting cytopenias on Day 42 AND does not exhibit MH on bone marrow \nbiopsy, this condition will not be considered a hematologic DLT and the patient will \ncommence Cycle 2 with the same doses of 5-Aza and panobinostat, provided no non-\nhematological DLT has been encountered. Patients with pre-existing cytopenias not \nevaluable for hematological toxicities (baseline neutrophil count \uf0a30.5 x 109/L or platelet \ncount \u2264 20 x 109/L) will commence cycle 2 with the same doses of 5-Aza and \npanobinostat on day 29 (i.e., day 1 of next cycle), if they have not experienced any non-\nhematological DLT (see Figure 6-3).\n",

There will be no dose reductions for panobinostat below 10 mg (dose \nlevel -1). Following dose modifications, the cycle duration should return to 28 days.\nIn AZA-001 pivotal phase III trial (Fenaux et al 2009a), about 90% of patients experienced \ngrade 3-4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Seventy-four percent of patients (n=72) with \nbaseline grade 0-2 thrombocytopenia developed grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia during treatment \nwith 5-Aza. However, 151 (86%) of patients remained on 75 mg/m 2 per day throughout the \nstudy with no dose adjustments for a median of 9 treatment cycles The median 5 -Aza cycle \nlength was 28 days and 21% of the cycles were longer than 35 days. These findings indicate \nthat provided adequate hematological supportive care, patients could continue on 5-Aza \ntherapy and benefit from it. Of note if that median time to response was rep orted to be 4 \nmonths. There is mounting clinical evidence that combining a hypomethylating agent, such as \n5-Aza, with DACi may shorten time to response to two cycles (Silverman et al 2008). \nTherefore, it is paramount to manage grade 3-4 cytopenia and possible residual disease with \noptimal hematological support in order to keep the patient, if not progressing, on treatment for \nseveral cycles to allow study treatment activity to occur.\nHematological toxicity deriving from the combination of panobinostat and 5-Aza and the \npotential risk for bleeding and infection/sepsis should be weighted against conventional \nmanagement of the disease and expected treatment benefit for the patients.\nFor phase IIb portion only: \nDuring the scheduled 2 weeks off of study treatment, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are \nanticipated to be resolved to at least patient baseline CTCAE grade.  If by Day 28, there is \nfailure to recover from Grade 4 neutropenia or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia to \u2265 patient \nbaseline CTCAE grade, then study treatment may be delayed up to Day 42.  If these \ncytopenias persist, Table 6-4 below is offered as guidance for dose reductions in the phase IIb \npart of the study. \nManagement of febrile neutropenia\nAt least one-half of neutropenic patients who become febrile have an established or occult \ninfection and at least one-fifth of patients with neutrophil of <1.0 x 109/L has bacteremia. \nBecause the progression of infection in neutropenic patients can be rapid, and because such \npatients with early bacterial infections cannot be reliably distinguished from non-infected \npatients at presentation, empirical antibiotic therapy should be administered promptly to all \nneutropenic patients at the onset of fever. Afebrile patients who are neutropenic but who have \nsigns or symptoms compatible with an infection should also have empirical antibiotic therapy \nbegun in the same manner as do febrile patients. Selection of the initial antibiotic regimens \nshould follow institutional guidance, as well as considering low vs. high risk patients and \npotential drug-drug interactions with study treatment, i.e. panobinostat (Section 6.6.2).\nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 66\nAmended Protocol Version 05 Clean\nStudy No. CLBH589H2101\nDose adjustments due to non hematological toxicity\nFor all treatment cycles, dosing should not be delayed beyond 42 days.\nNo dose modifications are required for grade 1 non-hematologic toxicity. Patients \nexperiencing NCI-CTCAE grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity (excluding prolonged QT \ninterval and peripheral neuropathy) may continue treatment with panobinostat at the current \ndose and schedule if in the best interest for the patient. More frequent monitoring of the \npatient may be required, and patients should be informed to call the Investigator immediately \nif there is any worsening of symptoms. (Table 6-6 for phase Ib part and Table 6-7 for phase\nIIb part)\nDose adjustments due to prolonged QT interval\nThe cardiac assessment schedule for the phase Ib and the phase IIb parts is shown in Table 7-\n5. Pre-dose ECG criteria is defined as a QTcF < 480 ms. In case any single pre-dose ECG \nduring the treatment cycle shows a QTcF \u2265 480 ms the administration of study drug is not \npermitted. Instead, dosing should be delayed until the next scheduled day of panobinostat \nintake and three pre-dose ECGs should be repeated. If, again, pre-dose ECG criteria are not \nmet the patient should be discontinued from the study. In case pre-dose ECG criteria are met \npanobinostat treatment can be resumed.\nIf any single post-dose ECG shows a QTcF \u2265 480 ms or an increase of more than 60 ms from \nbaseline panobinostat dosing should be delayed until the next scheduled day of panobinostat \nintake and three pre-dose ECGs done. If pre-dose ECG criteria are not met the patient should \nbe discontinued from the study. In case pre-dose ECG criteria are met (QTcF < 480 ms) \npanobinostat treatment can be resumed with a 10mg dose reduction.\nIf any single ECG shows QTcF > 500 ms the patient is discontinued from the study.\nIn case of QT prolongation it is recommended to check and correct patient\u2019s serum potassium, \nmagnesium, calcium and phosphorus immediately, as well as evaluate concomitant \nmedication. In case the prolongation is due to electrolyte imbalance or concomitant \nmedication the patient can continue the trial once these causes can be eliminated.\nThe Sponsor should be notified immediately of any QT prolongation that would cause delay \nof study drug administration, change in panobinostat dose or discontinuation of the patient \nfrom the study.\nDose adjustments due to 5-Aza-related renal toxicity\nThere are no reportings of renal toxicity with panobinostat in the ongoing clinical program. \nOn the other hand, renal tubular dysfunction manifesting as hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia \nor hyponatremia with or without increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) \nmay infrequently occur with 5-Aza therapy. If serum bicarbonate falls below 20mEq/L and \nthe decrease is considered secondary to 5-Aza the patient should receive oral bicarbonate \nreplacement. If the event cannot be controlled replacement therapy should be continued and \nthe next 5-Aza cycle dosage be reduced by 50%.

Informative \npriors for panobinostat will be derived based on the DLT rate obtained from a similar trial \n[CLBH589B2102, arm X] with the similar populations, formulations, dose regimens and for \n5-Aza from publications. MTD will be assessed during the first treatment cycle. Each cohort \nwill consist of a minimum of 3 patients fully evaluable for therapy-related toxicities over the \nfirst cycle of treatment. Posterior probabilities of the DLT from the model will be summarized. \nSelection of the next dose will be based on these probabilities as well as on other safety and \nlaboratory data. For details please refer to the [Post-text supplement 2].\nDose recommendation will be based on posterior summaries for each dose combination and \nthe interval probabilities for underdosing, targeted, excessive, and unacceptable toxicity for \nintervals. Once updated, the distribution summarizes the probability that the true probability \nof a DLT for each dose combination lies in one of the following categories:\n\uf0b7\n[0, 20%) under-dosing\n\uf0b7\n[20%, 35%) targeted toxicity\n\uf0b7\n[35%,60%) excessive toxicity\n\uf0b7\n[60, 100%] unacceptable toxicity.\nFollowing the principle of EWOC, after each cohort of patients the recommended dose \ncombination is the one with the highest posterior probability of DLT in the target interval \n[20%, 35%) among the doses fulfilling the overdose criteria: there is less than 25% chance of \neither excessive or unacceptable toxicity. The maximum inter-cohort dose escalation \npermitted is 100%. The dose recommended by the adaptive BLRM may be regarded as \ninformation to be integrated with a clinical assessment of the safety data observed thus far in \ndetermining the next dose to be investigated. In any case, the next dose will not exceed the \nrecommended dose by the BLRM. Cohorts of at least 3 and up to a maximum of 12 MTD-\nevaluable patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation part including at least 9 patients at \nthe MTD. The Bayesian model will be updated prior to additional enrollment under the \nfollowing scenarios:\n1. If the first 2 patients in a cohort experience DLT prior to the enrollment of the 3rd patient. \nEnrollment will be halted, the model will be updated, and any new patients will be \nenrolled at a dose satisfying the overdose criteria, no higher than the current dose level.\n2. No additional patients will be enrolled until the current cohort is completed and the model \nis updated.\n3. For cohorts of > 3 patients if the observed number of DLTs exceeds 25% of the currently \nenrolled patients to that dose level, enrollment will be halted until all patients complete \none cycle of dosing or experience DLT. The model will be updated to determine the \nuncertainty about the probability of DLT at each dose level. New patients will be enrolled \nat a dose level up to the highest satisfying the overdose criteria.\n",
