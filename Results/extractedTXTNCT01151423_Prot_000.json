This population includes symptomatic patients with acute episodes of acquired TTP, requiring treatment with plasma exchange (PE).  Objectives  Primary  \u2022 Reduction of time-to-response, defined by the achievement of laboratory blood marker response, confirmed at 48 hours after the initial reporting of this response  Secondary (including longer-term disease sequelae) \u2022 Improvement in number of subjects responding to therapy \u2022 Reduction in PE procedure-related items  \u2022 Reduction of time to resolution or improvement of signs and symptoms typical of TTP, including blood markers \u2022 Reduction of number of exacerbations (defined as recurrent thrombocytopenia following a response and requiring a re-initiation of daily PE treatment after \u2265 1 day but \u2264 30 days after the last daily PE) and relapses (defined as de novo event of TTP that occurs later than 30 days after the last daily PE)1,2 \u2022 Improvement of cognitive level at steady state post acute phase \u2022 Improvement of clinical symptoms and organ function  \u2022 Reduction in mortality within the PE treatment period

                        "Content": "  The multimeric plasma protein vWF is essential for recruiting circulating platelets to the damaged vessel wall upon vascular injury. This recruitment is mediated through binding of the vWF A1-domain with the platelet receptor glycoprotein GPIb-IX-V. Upon expression by endothelial cells, vWF is secreted into the circulation as ultra-large multimers or ultra-large vWF (ULvWF). These multimers are processed into smaller regular sized multimers through enzymatic cleavage by ADAMTS13. In these regular sized multimers of vWF, the GPIb-IX-V platelet receptor binding site in the A1 domain is cryptic and will not spontaneously react with platelets. A conformational activation of the GPIb-IX-V platelet receptor binding site in the A1 domain is triggered by immobilisation or under conditions of shear stress. This then results in platelet adhesion and subsequently in thrombus formation.  ",

                        "Content": "  TTP is a rare and life-threatening disorder of the blood coagulation system, in which accumulation of ULvWF multimers has been implicated, leading to an increased risk of thrombus formation in small blood vessels due to excessive platelet aggregation. The condition is characterised by systemic platelet aggregation in the microcirculation, producing fluctuating ischaemia in many organs. If sustained, this may cause tissue infarction, associated with profound thrombocytopenia and erythrocyte fragmentation. ULvWF multimers have the natural ability to spontaneously interact with the platelet receptor GPIb-IX-V. In healthy subjects, these ULvWF multimers are immediately processed into regular sized vWF multimers via cleavage by ADAMTS13. However, in patients with TTP, processing of the ULvWF multimers is impaired, resulting in the persistence of the constitutively active A1 domain of the ULvWF which readily interacts with the GPIb-IX-V platelet receptor. This eventually results in formation of the characteristic blood clots found in the TTP patient population.

Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins based on the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain antibodies, occurring in the Camelidae family. They have a high degree of sequence and structural homology to human immunoglobulin VH domains. ALX-0081 avidly binds to its vWF multimeric target, thereby blocking the interaction of any sizes and activation stages of multimeric vWF with the GPIb-IX-V platelet receptor. The interaction of ALX-0081 with vWF is highly specific and it does not interact with human blood cells or platelets. Furthermore, its interference with the platelet GPIb-IX-V receptor is selectively through the binding of the vWF A1 domain and it does not affect the capacity of vWF to interact with fibrillar collagens or with collagen type VI. The Nanobody does not affect the activity of the vWF-protease ADAMTS13, nor does it interfere with the binding of FVIII to vWF. In in vitro assays with plasma from TTP patients, ALX-0081 selectively inhibits the interaction of the constitutively active A1 domain in the ULvWF multimers with the platelet GPIb-IX-V receptor. Therefore it prevents the characteristic platelet string formation, typical of TTP, which constitutes of small thrombi leading to platelet agglutination in the microvasculature, resulting in local ischaemia and platelet consumption. Given the established role of the interaction between vWF and platelet GPIb-IX-V in the pathogenesis of TTP, it is anticipated that ALX-0081 may provide a new option for the treatment of this condition. Therefore, targeting the activity of ULvWF and preventing the interaction with GPIb-IX-V is an attractive concept for treatment and prevention of thrombotic complications in TTP.  ",

The efficacy of ALX-0081 was studied in vitro and showed that ALX-0081 is able to inhibit platelet adhesion to collagen specifically under high shear conditions and block ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) with a complete inhibition at a concentration of ~ 0.4 \u00b5g/mL.

In tissue cross \nreactivity studies using immunohistochemistry on human, cynomolgus monkey and guinea \npig tissues, no unexpected staining was observed.  \nThe efficacy and safety of ALX-0081 was investigated in vivo in a modified Folts\u2019 model for \nstable angina in baboons. In all of the animals tested, the antithrombotic activity of ALX-0081 \nwas stronger than that observed for Plavix\u00ae (clopidogrel), Aspirin\u00ae (acetylsalicylic acid) and \nHeparin\u00ae (heparin). Similar efficacy of ALX-0081 was observed compared to the potent \nantithrombotic drug ReoPro\u00ae (Abciximab). The plasma concentration of ALX-0081 in \nbaboons required for full inhibition of thrombus formation was between 0.3 and 0.5 \u03bcg/mL. A \nbleeding model involving measurement of the amount of blood from a well defined wound in \nbaboons showed less bleeding with ALX-0081 than with Plavix\u00ae or ReoPro\u00ae even at doses \nexceeding the effective dose 10-fold. These results clearly demonstrate that the therapeutic \nwindow of ALX-0081 is much wider compared to the current marketed drugs Plavix\u00ae and \nReoPro\u00ae (Figure 2) \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n100000\nDose [ug /kg] \nEfficacy [%]\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nSurgical bleeding\nALX-0081 efficacy\nReopro efficacy\nPlavix efficacy\nALX-0081 bleeding\nReopro bleeding\nPlavix bleeding\n \nFigure 2: \nTherapeutic window of ALX-0081, ReoPro\u00ae and Plavix\u00ae in a baboon model.  \n \nEfficacy expressed as % inhibition of cyclic flow reductions in a modified Folts\u2019 \nmodel and safety expressed as n-fold increase bleeding from a well defined \nincision compared to a control level is shown in function of dose administered. \n \nThe antithrombotic activity of ALX-0081 in baboons is of short duration (several hours) and it \ncan be reversed by administration of vWF, indicating that vWF can be used as an antidote \nfor ALX-0081. \nDue to the lack of a relevant animal model, no in vivo efficacy of ALX-0081 to neutralise \nULvWF was demonstrated.

These strings support adhesion of platelets even under static and low shear conditions (Figure 3A). In the presence of normal plasma the ULvWF strings are rapidly cleaved by the protease activity of ADAMTS13, whereas in plasma from patients with TTP platelet deposition to the vWF strings is retained due to the lack of functional ADAMTS13 (Figure 3B). Importantly, ALX-0081 added to the TTP plasma completely blocks platelet deposition (Figure 3C), thereby demonstrating that ALX-0081 not only inhibits the regular sized vWF multimers but also ULvWF released by endothelial cells. However, if platelets were allowed to form platelet strings prior to ALX-0081 addition, ALX-0081 was not able to detach these platelets.3   Figure 3: Effect of ALX-0081 on platelet adhesion to ULvWF.  Images captured from real-time video microscopy: captures of platelets perfused over stimulated endothelial cells under conditions of low shear stress (300s-1). Platelets resuspended in buffer (A) or in plasma from TTP patients (B) adhere to ULvWF thereby forming platelet strings (red arrows) on the surface of endothelial cells. In the presence of plasma from TTP patients, ALX-0081 completely abolishes the platelet interaction with ULvWF (C).  ",

                        "Content": "  ALX-0081 shows a non-linear kinetic profile. In all species, a first phase characterised by a rapid decline in plasma levels can be described at the higher doses immediately after administration (i.v.) or after peak plasma levels are reached (s.c./intramuscular [i.m.]). This is thought to be caused by rapid distribution of the unbound drug in combination with rapid elimination via renal clearance (glomerular filtration). In cross-reactive species this decline is followed by a second phase.4,5 The terminal half-life (t1/2) of ALX-0081 -more precisely ALX-0081 bound to vWF- ranges between 5-36 hours across the relevant species. A biodistribution study with radiolabelled ALX-0081 supported this hypothesis and clearly showed that ALX-0081 bound to vWF follows a hepatic clearance pathway, whereas unbound drug is excreted via the kidneys.6  Since excess ALX-0081 over a vWF occupancy ratio of 1 is cleared rapidly, trough drug concentrations did not increase significantly even upon multiple administrations at high doses in toxicology studies, again pointing towards a low potential for accumulation. Clinical anticipated administration routes are i.v. and s.c. The absolute bioavailability of ALX-0081 after s.c. administration, in cynomolgus monkey, ranged from 82 to 97%.7  Document ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013Ablynx NV Clinical Study Protocol Study ALX-0681-2.1/10 June 24, 2013 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31/127  ",

                        "Content": "  Currently, the toxicology program for ALX-0081 consists of single dose (SD) toxicity studies both in cynomolgus monkey (i.v. and s.c.) and guinea pig (i.v.), 2-week repeated dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey (i.v., s.c.) including safety pharmacology assessment and 13-week repeated dose toxicity studies in guinea pig and cynomolgus monkey with an 8-week recovery including safety pharmacology and fertility functional assessment. Local tolerance was assessed separately in rabbit.   The pivotal toxicology studies were performed for 13- week duration in cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig as the non-rodent and rodent species, respectively. In both studies, animals were given s.c. 4 times daily doses of ALX-0081 at 6 hour intervals (0, 0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg per dose) for 13 weeks.  Data obtained during the in life phase show that vWF/FVIII levels were decreased with a non-cumulative pharmacology effect in cynomolgus monkey and guinea pig (FVIII only), with a mean maximum decrease from individual baseline of FVIII of 84 % in all dose groups in cynomolgus monkey. The complete data set including recovery phase is under assessment. In guinea pig, FVIII decreases with a mean of 47.0% (preliminary data reported for 13-week toxicity study, raw data without QC).  Full neutralisation of vWF activity, defined as below the limit of detection, was demonstrated by RICO assays (PD marker) in both guinea pig and cynomolgus monkey (preliminary data analysis). Clinical observations in the 13-week toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey revealed slight to fairly severe haematomas and swellings at the injection sites in a dose-related manner. Macroscopic examination at necropsy revealed haemorrhagic s.c. tissue at the injection sites in several ALX-0081-treated animals of all dose groups. In addition, slightly increased bleeding at injection sites was recorded in one male (4 mg/kg/day) and two females (4 and 40 mg/kg/day). The same female at 4 mg/kg/day showed exaggerated menstrual bleeding on Day 30 and the same female at 40 mg/kg/day had a nose bleed. All bleeding events were described to be related to the pharmacological effect of ALX-0081.  In the 13-week toxicity study in guinea pig, no ALX-0081 treatment related adverse effects were observed in clinical signs, water and food consumption, body weight, clinical pathology parameters and urinalysis. Macroscopic examinations at necropsy revealed haemorrhagic s.c. tissue at the injection sites in all dose groups. The observations are similar to those seen in cynomolgus monkey. Incidence and severity increased with dose and the observed effects were also considered to be related to the pharmacological effect of ALX-0081.  Document ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013Ablynx NV Clinical Study Protocol Study ALX-0681-2.1/10 June 24, 2013 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32/127  There were no ALX-0081 treatment-related effects on electrocardiogram (ECG) and organ weight. No changes in ophthalmological and auditory parameters were noted in both guinea pig and cynomolgus monkey. In summary, these findings confirms that even at high doses (and exposures) effects on FVIII levels are within expected ranges, the clinical observations in the nonclinical species correlate with the minor findings in clinical trials so far and that continuous treatment with high doses of ALX-0081 might lead to symptoms which resemble the mild vWD type 1 and 2.   A GLP embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in guinea pigs has been conducted. No embryo-fetal toxicity and no teratogenic potential have been observed. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was higher than 20 mg/kg/day since no adverse effects were observed.  Local tolerance has been studied in rabbits, by administration via the i.v., s.c., i.m., intra-arterial (i.a.) and paravenous routes in doses up to 1.2 mg/kg b.w. administered in 0.5 mL/kg. No test item-related alterations were observed.  Immunogenicity was evaluated during toxicology studies in guinea pig and cynomolgus monkey. In general, ADA could be detected in a limited subset of animals after i.v or s.c. single or multiple dose (MD) administration in both species, which did however not compromise the exposure. Moreover, PD markers were not affected by measured ADA in any of the studies, indicating indirectly that these antibodies were not neutralising the activity of ALX-0081.  In conclusion, ALX-0081 has been well tolerated in guinea pig and cynomolgus monkey used as relevant toxicology animal species as a consequence of (i) high target specificity (ii) a mode of action specific for pathological conditions and (iii) a unique self-regulating PK profile which leads to rapid clearance of excess drug.

The Phase Ia trial in healthy male volunteers has been completed successfully, as well as the SD and MD stages of the Phase Ib trial in stable angina patients undergoing elective PCI. An open-label extension (OLE) of the latter trial to evaluate administration of ALX-0081 by i.v. bolus injection compared to i.v. infusion has completed the treatment phase. Finally, a Phase II trial in high risk PCI patients, comparing ALX-0081 and ReoPro\u00ae was initiated in July 2009.  The Phase Ia trial was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of ALX-0081 in healthy male volunteers. The first dose of study medication was i.v. 500 \u00b5g ALX-0081 or placebo (dose level 1) followed by 2-fold, 4-fold, 8-fold, 16-fold and 24-fold of the first dose in dose levels 2-6, respectively.  The subsequent Phase Ib study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or biologically effective dose (BED) and the Phase II recommended dose of ALX-0081 in ACS patients. In addition, this study aimed to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ALX-0081 in patients undergoing PCI and to document the biological and clinical response to therapy. In Stage A of the study, single ascending doses (2, 4, 6 and 9 mg) of ALX-0081 (n = 3 per dose level) or placebo (n = 1 per dose level) were administered as a 1h i.v. infusion. In the second stage of the trial (Stage B), multiple dosing was evaluated and subjects received an initial dose of 6 mg, followed by 3 subsequent doses of 4 mg every 6 hours (n = 6 ALX-0081 and n = 2 placebo). Route of administration was also i.v. infusion. Following Stage B, an open label extension was initiated with 22 subjects (Stage C) (n = 20 ALX-0081 and n = 2 placebo) in order to determine the optimal i.v. route of administration for ALX-0081 in man (bolus injections or 1 hour infusions).  The conclusions of both trials can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Single and multiple i.v. administrations of ALX-0081 are safe and well tolerated  \u2022 The BED (providing a complete inhibition of vWF-mediated platelet aggregation for > 24 hours) and Phase II recommended dose is a SD of 6 mg, followed by 3 subsequent doses of 4 mg every 6 hours, given as i.v. bolus injections \u2022 RICO can be used as a reliable biomarker for the PD effect of ALX-0081, i.e. inhibition of vWF-mediated platelet aggregation Document ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013Ablynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 36/127  \n\u2022 \nIn subjects receiving the BED, mean RIPA values below 10% were maintained for a \nmaximum of 24 hours and clinically relevant RICO inhibition was maintained for a \nmaximum of 30 hours \n\u2022 \nNon-linear PK properties were determined \n\u2022 \nHalf-life values were similar after single and repeated dosing.

In both studies the NOAEL proved to be above 4x10 mg ALX-0081/kg body weight, the maximum allowable volume of administrations per day for a guinea pig or cynomolgus monkey study. The biomarker RICO was inhibited during the toxicity studies, thereby indicating the absence of neutralising antibodies against ALX-0081. Comparing the results obtained with the 13 weeks cynomolgus monkey toxicity study with a fixed daily dose of 10 mg in humans, revealed a RatioAUC24 of 82, demonstrating the presence of wide therapeutic window. Using PK modeling a predicted human exposure of 10.3 \u00b5g.h/mL (AUC24h) following a possible bid 10 mg administration (20 mg/subject/day) can be compared to exposure reached in toxicity studies with a resulting ratio of 54 for cynomolgus monkey. Due to the conservative correction factor applied in the exposure margin calculations of guinea pigs and the limitations in volume that could be administrated to guinea pigs, a 10-fold systemic exposure margin could not be demonstrated in the guinea Document ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013Ablynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 41/127  \npigs. Importantly, the NOAEL was not reached during the subchronic toxicity study in guinea \npigs. \nHence the data obtained from the 13 weeks cynomolgus monkey study allow us to conclude \nthat the safety margins in terms of relative systemic exposure to ALX-0081 can be \nconsidered as very wide. \n \nRisk for bleeding \nThe most prominent risk of the currently used non-specific antithrombotic agents is an \nelevated bleeding diathesis or apparent bleeding. Beside any unexpected effects, bleeding \nalso represents the most relevant safety concern for ALX-0081. In this context ALX-0081 \nwas investigated in a preclinical surgical bleeding model.11 In this study, surgical blood loss in \nanimals receiving ALX-0081 was comparable to blood loss in Heparin\u00ae treated animals, and \n2- and 4-fold less than in Plavix\u00ae and ReoPro\u00ae treated animals, respectively. This indicates \nthat ALX-0081 may be safer than Plavix\u00ae and ReoPro\u00ae in terms of bleeding risk. The \nALX-0081 doses used in this surgical bleeding model were more than 10-fold the \ndocumented effective antithrombotic dose. \n \nIn the 13-week and 26-week RD toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey, anti-FVIII antibodies \n(AFA) were detected in 4 male animals with no associated clinical signs, and in one animal \nwith associated haemolytic anaemia, signs of inflammation and extremely low FVIII:C \nactivity. More details are included in Section 4.3 of the Investigator\u2019s Brochure. \n \nA good understanding of the biology of vWF and the clinical presentation of patients with \ndeficiency of vWF helps to understand the observations seen in the conducted preclinical \nand clinical studies and to assess the risk for bleeding appropriately. It is well known that \nmost patients suffering from a deficiency of vWF (vWD) have mild-to-moderate quantitative \ndeficiencies of vWF and FVIII, which are co-ordinately reduced to 5 to 30 percent of normal \nplasma levels (5 to 30 IU/dL).12 This reduction is not associated with spontaneous bleeding \nbut with bleeding after surgery (which is typical of coagulopathies) and mucosal tract \nhaemorrhages such as epistaxis and menorraghia (which are typical of thrombocytopathies). \nIt should be taken into account that these patients have a chronic, i.e. life-long, impairment of \nvWF and their vWF levels always stay far below 30 IU/dL. These patients don\u2019t receive \nregular prophylaxis, because their bleeding tendency is less severe. Only in patients with \nchronic and complete absence of vWF or levels below 5-10 IU/dL is a prophylaxis with vWF \nand FVIII indicated.  \n \nDocument ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013\nAblynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 42/127  \nSince ALX-0081 interacts with the A1 domain of vWF, RICO is inhibited also during the \ntoxicity studies. In addition, statistical significant drops in FVIII and vWF:Ag levels were \nobserved in cynomolgus monkeys. In guinea pigs, the observed effects on FVIII were less \npronounced. Although drops for FVIII were observed in both species, sufficient FVIII \nremained available to ensure proper coagulation (see also 2.3.3). No signs of bleeding, other \nthan bruising at the injection sites were observed in the guinea pig study. In the cynomolgus \nmonkeys study, slightly increased bleeding at injection sites were recorded in one male \n(4 mg/kg/day) and two females (4 and 40 mg/kg/day). Mucosal bleedings (1 exaggerated \nmenstrual bleeding and 1 nose bleed) were observed in the same females. Importantly, \nalthough systemic exposure reached levels up to 80-fold higher than what can be expected \nin men during the Phase II trial, no signs of internal bleeding were observed. The observed \nclinical effects in cynomolgus monkeys are in line with the clinical presentation of patients \nwith a mild to moderate vWD.  \nFrom the safety data collected from the Phase I studies in healthy volunteers and patients \nwith stable angina, a single i.v. administration of 0.5 mg up to 12 mg and respective multiple \nadministrations up to 18 mg total dose of ALX-0081 as a short infusion over 1 hour were well \ntolerated in all participating subjects. The observed mild decreases in FVIII and vWF levels \nwere expected as they indicate the biological effectiveness of the drug. None of the observed \ndecreases in FVIII chromogene or vWF levels were recorded as clinically significantly. \nIn healthy subjects, s.c. administration of ALX-0081 as a SD or administered as daily \ninjection for up to 14 days was well tolerated and no difference could be detected regarding \nthe number of subjects with AEs and their severity. All injection and puncture site reactions \nwere of mild intensity and were classified as clinically not relevant. S.c. administration of \nALX-0081 as a SD or administered as daily injection for up to 14 days resulted in a fast and \nreversible decrease of FVIII and vWF. The average decrease of vWF levels ranged from \napproximately 50% decrease in low dose groups to 70% decrease, compared to pre-dose \nlevel, in the high dose groups. For FVIII, a rapid average decrease can be found in all doses \ngroups ranging from 30%, compared to pre-dose level, in the 2 mg dosing group to 50-65% \nin the other SD groups. Reversal takes place after approximately 72 h after dosing. A \nsustained decrease of approximately 50% can be found after dosing in both MD groups. \nLevels are back to basal levels after approximately 48 h post dosing in the MD groups. None \nof the observed decreases in FVIII were recorded as abnormal/clinically significant PD \nassessments or as AEs. \n \nIn summary, in all healthy subjects and patients with stable angina, the treatment with \nALX-0081 resulted in a rapid and reversible reduction of vWF and FVIII levels, but this \nreduction never reached the levels indicating spontaneous bleeding for patients with mild or \nDocument ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013\nAblynx NV Clinical Study Protocol Study ALX-0681-2.1/10 June 24, 2013 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43/127  more severe forms of vWD. It is therefore expected that the further administration of ALX-0081 does not result in a clinically significant reduction of vWF and FVIII mandating prophylaxis or treatment for an imminent bleeding risk. Of note, vWF as antidote is readily available in the respective treatment institutions and would immediately antagonise the activity of ALX-0081 and Preclinical studies have demonstrated that vWF concentrates can indeed antagonise the activity of ALX-0081.  Immunogenicity ALX-0081 is structurally not identical to an endogenous protein and has no agonistic function. Consequently, the risk for developing antibodies with potential adverse consequences such as the neutralisation of an endogenous protein or a hyper-agonistic function is considered to be low. At present, the development of ADA after i.v. and after s.c. administration of ALX-0081 has been evaluated in the conducted Phase I trials. I.v. treatment during the Phase I trials consisted of either SD treatment or MD administrations with 4 doses during 24 h. S.c. treatment included repeated daily administration of ALX-0081 for up to 14 days. In none of the Phase I trials, treatment-emergent ADA were observed. During the planned Phase II TTP trial, ALX-0081 will be given on top of current standard of care treatment, thereby limiting the potential consequences of the development of ADA. For many of these TTP patients, immunosuppressive treatment will be part of their standard of care treatment. Other TTP patients carry an underlying disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or cancer) associated with a depressed immune status. In both groups of TTP patients the probability for development of ADA is anticipated to be reduced.   ",

                        "Content": "  Although the introduction of PE and transfusion has significantly reduced the mortality rates from TTP over the last three decades, the condition still carries a significant risk of mortality and morbidity. The mortality rate of acute bouts in acute idiopathic TTP, in patients managed with the current therapies remains in the order of 10% to 30%.1,13,14 In the case of secondary TTP, PE and transfusion are recognised to be less effective and the mortality rate is considerably higher. In the cases when the disease is secondary to pregnancy, in which PE is regarded as reasonably effective the mortality rate of an acute bout of TTP is approximately 25%, rising to over 40% in cases with concurrent pre-eclampsia.15 However, in cases secondary to, for example, underlying malignancies or bone marrow transplant the mortality rate remains at 40% to 60% despite the use of such treatment regimens.14,16,17   Document ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013Ablynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 44/127  \nPotential effect of ALX-0081 on pathophysiology of TTP \nULvWF-mediated platelet aggregation is recognised as a key element in the pathogenesis of \nidiopathic TTP both in acute disease, in refractory and relapsing patients, and in the familial \nform of the disease. In secondary TTP, although the underlying etiologies are varied, ULvWF \nalso appears to play a fundamental role in the underlying pathophysiological processes that \nhave been proposed to underlie the condition. The inhibition of ULvWF-mediated platelet \naggregation represents a rational approach to treatment that may prove to be of value in the \nmanagement of all subtypes of TTP. Given the continuing significant level of mortality from \nTTP and the observed complications of PE and transfusion, there is a clear need for the \ndevelopment of such additional therapeutic approaches to supplement, or potentially reduce \nthe need for, these methods of treatment. On the basis of the available information, \nALX-0081 may offer such an additional option to further improve the management of TTP.  \n \nPotential benefit of ALX-0081 in TTP: efficacy \nThe current therapy of TTP with PE and transfusion provides replacement ADAMTS13 and \nremoves antibodies against the enzyme, thus progressively leading to a normalisation of \nULvWF processing. However, this treatment requires multiple exchanges and transfusions \nover many days, during which time there is no direct pharmacological targeting of the active \nprocess of ULvWF-mediated platelet aggregation. ALX-0081 has been demonstrated to \ninhibit platelet-vWF interactions and particularly ULvWF-mediated platelet interaction in vitro \nand has also been shown to have no impact on ADAMTS13 function and, therefore, would \nnot be anticipated to interfere with the enzyme replaced by plasma transfusion. In a modified \nFolt\u2019s model in baboons, which represents a relevant model for ACS, ALX-0081 has been \ndemonstrated to exert a strong antithrombotic effect with a lower degree of bleeding \ncompared with other antithrombotic agents. In an initial Phase I study, ALX-0081 has been \ndemonstrated to inhibit ristocetin induced platelet aggregation (a vWF-mediated process) in \nthe blood of healthy volunteers. \nOn the basis of these findings, it can be reasonably anticipated that ALX-0081 could be \nutilised, in combination with PE and transfusion, to directly inhibit the continuing formation of \nsmall thrombi and platelet consumption in the microvasculature. This may permit more rapid \ncontrol of the underlying thrombotic process and accompanying platelet consumption, with \nthe potential benefits of a reduced degree of ischaemic and haemorrhagic complications. It \nmay also result in a more rapid clinical recovery with a shorter period and reduced number of \nPEs and transfusions. In addition, the demonstrated inhibition of ULvWF-mediated platelet \ninteraction by ALX-0081 and the observed antithrombotic effects raise the potential for its \nlonger-term use after patients have recovered from an acute bout of TTP to prevent relapses \nof the disease. A reduced frequency of acute bouts of TTP would represent a significant \nDocument ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013\nAblynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 45/127  \nbenefit, with a potential for a reduction in the mortality and morbidity associated with TTP and \na further reduction in the need for PE and transfusions over a patient\u2019s lifetime.  \n \nPotential benefit of ALX-0081 in TTP: quantification of major contribution to patient \ncare \nFor acquired TTP, the hypothesis of the proposed Phase II trial is to demonstrate a decrease \nof 44% in the time-to-response, objectivated by a recovery of platelets \u2265 150,000/\u00b5L. Platelet \ncount increase is a sign of diminished pathological platelet aggregation, as well as a better \nprotection against bleeding. The decrease of LDH is a sign of decreased haemolysis and/or \ntissue ischaemia. This response must be confirmed up to 48 hours after the time-to-\nresponse. \n \nPotential benefit of ALX-0081 in TTP: safety \nWhile a more rapid recovery from TTP and a potential for a reduction in exacerbations and \nrelapses would be of clear clinical benefit in terms of treatment efficacy, the potential for a \nreduction in the duration and frequency of PE and transfusion would also provide additional \nbenefits in terms of patient safety. \nAlthough PE and transfusion are currently regarded as the standard treatment in the \nmanagement of TTP, the procedures carry the risk of significant complications. The PE \nprocedure requires high fluid volumes and flow rates necessitating the use of central venous \ndual lumen haemodialysis catheters. Complications from the procedure include haemorrhage \nfrom catheter insertion, sepsis, catheter thrombosis, pneumothorax, fluid overload, hypoxia \nand hypotension.18-22 Anaphylactoid reactions complicate 0.25% to 0.5% of procedures.13,19 \nIn addition, the infusion of plasma containing blood products can cause a non-infective \nTRALI. This condition is recognised as one of the most frequent causes of transfusion-\nrelated fatalities with an incidence estimated to be 0.02% to 0.05% per plasma containing \nunit18 with a daily average of 17 plasma units, the daily risk can be calculated to a range of \n0.34% to 0.85%. Most patients with TTP require multiple PEs and transfusions. Patients with \nacute idiopathic TTP require daily treatments, and an average of approximately 16 \ntreatments is required to achieve remission.13 In refractory cases the frequency of treatment \nmay be increased to twice-daily.13 In the case of patients with familial TTP, regular \nprophylactic plasma infusions at two to three week intervals are recommended.23 \nAnaphylaxis and TRALI thus represent clear risks to patients with TTP whose treatment \nrequires such a frequency and regularity of PEs and transfusions. While it is thought that this \nrisk may be lower if solvent/detergent (S/D) treated plasma is used instead of fresh frozen \nplasma, the use of large volumes of S/D plasma may be associated with an increased risk of \nvenous thromboembolism.13,18 Overall, it is estimated that approximately 30% to 40% \nDocument ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013\nAblynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 46/127  \nof patients will experience adverse effects from PE and transfusion, and the mortality rate \nfrom the procedure is of the order of 2% to 3%.2,19  \nAs summarised above, the information currently available from the preclinical and clinical \nstudies with ALX-0081 also indicates that it is a well tolerated agent and, in particular, the \npotential for the risk of bleeding appears to be low. The currently available data suggest, \ntherefore, that the potential reduction in PE and transfusion and their associated \ncomplications may be achieved without significant adverse effects from the use of ALX-0081 \nitself. If this is borne out in clinical research, it could represent a clear safety benefit for the \nuse of the product in the treatment of patients with TTP. \n \nPotential benefit of ALX-0081 in TTP: quality of life \nFollowing recovery from a bout of TTP, many patients describe cognitive abnormalities for \nmany years and report troublesome problems with memory, concentration, decreased \nenergy and fatigue. Such symptoms have a negative impact on the quality of patients\u2019 daily \nlives. Furthermore, this deficit in quality of life may occur in all patients who have TTP, \nregardless of the aetiology and severity.24 It is thought that these symptoms may be reflective \nof the residual effects of tissue ischaemia. On this basis, it could be reasonably proposed \nthat the potential for a more rapid recovery from TTP and the limitation of thrombus formation \nin the microvasculature that ALX-0081 should provide, may result in an improved longer-term \noutcome for the patients in terms of their quality of life.  \n \nSummary \nThe research conducted into TTP over the past three decades has improved the \nunderstanding of the pathophysiology of the disease allowing for the potential development \nof novel agents targeting the underlying disease processes. There are no currently approved \ntherapies for TTP, and although there are newer therapies currently undergoing evaluation, \nthe studies of these potential treatments are at a relatively early stage. \nALX-0081 represents a novel approach to the treatment of TTP and the information available \nfrom in vitro, in vivo and early clinical studies all suggest a clear rationale for its use in this \ndisease and a reasonable expectation that it will provide significant benefit in terms of \nefficacy, safety and quality of life for patients with TTP. \nThrough its inhibition of ULvWF-mediated platelet aggregation and resulting antithrombotic \neffect ALX-0081 may permit more rapid control of acute bouts of TTP when used in \ncombination with PE and transfusion. This would potentially reduce the risk of organ \nischaemia and a more rapid normalisation of the platelet count could also reduce the risk of \nhaemorrhagic complications. Its use may also result in improved outcomes in poorly \nresponsive patients, including those with secondary TTP where mortality from the disease \nDocument ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013\nAblynx NV Clinical Study Protocol Study ALX-0681-2.1/10 June 24, 2013 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47/127  remains high.

                "Content": "  The initial i.v. administration of investigational drug prior to the first PE on study is justified based upon a Phase I study in healthy volunteers as well as a Phase Ib trial in ACS patients. In both studies, an immediate PD effect was observed, namely RIPA \u2264 10% in healthy volunteers and RICO \u2264 20% in ACS patients (see section 2.4). It is believed that all active ULvWF present in the blood that has not yet aggregated platelets can be inhibited from further platelet aggregation by saturating it with the immediate i.v. injection of 10 mg anti-vWF Nanobody. This would allow for predicted protection by the investigational product against further platelet aggregation until the time of start of PE therapy.  The further administrations of the investigational drug will be performed by the s.c. injection route. The proposed s.c. dosing regimen of the ALX-0081 was investigated in a Phase I study with healthy volunteers. The daily dosing of ALX-0081 10 mg as s.c. injection resulted in a complete and sustainable inhibition of the biomarker RICO indicating the complete suppression of vWF-mediated platelet aggregation. PK modeling of these subjects with normal vWF pre-treatment levels demonstrated that the required occupancy of the target vWF resulting in maximum PD effect (i.e. RICO \u2264 20%) is seen for a wide range of ALX-0081 plasma concentrations, i.e. between 100-500 ng/mL for 7 treatment days and between 100-350 ng/mL for 14 treatment days. This implies that the maximum pharmacological effect can already be achieved at relative low plasma levels of ALX-0081. Taking into consideration that vWF plasma concentrations in patients with signs and symptoms of TTP can be considerably higher than in healthy volunteers, these data suggest that the proposed doses allow for full target occupancy and subsequent complete inhibition of the biomarker in patients with vWF levels within the range of 1 to 3 fold above the previously studied levels in healthy subjects and patients suffering from ACS. This range of target occupancy (i.e. saturation of plasma vWF) lies within the reported levels of plasma vWF for patients undergoing PE as treatment for TTP. 25,26  The dosing scheme allows for a study drug treatment interruption based on clinically significant adverse drug reaction (i.e. bleeding events).

The frequency of PE is occasionally reduced (\u2018tapered\u2019) rather than stopping completely at time of response, however this is not based on randomised clinical trial data and is not recommended per this protocol (although it is allowed if considered necessary by the Investigator). The study drug will be administered as adjunctive treatment at specific times relative to the PE procedures.  The first administration is a single i.v. bolus injection, administered by a push injection. All subsequent administrations are s.c. injections.

Note that the 1-week and 3-weeks after the last day of PE (including tapering) \nsampling may be done at the weekly visit, even if not exactly 1 or 3 weeks. \nThe resulting data will be provided to the Investigator for information at the end of the study. \nIn case an investigator has no access to similar assays and availability of ADAMTS13 and \nanti-ADAMTS13 antibody titre are considered essential for clinical decision making, an ad \nhoc determination of the results can be organised (under supervision of the country \ncoordinator). \nPlatelets and LDH will be measured from blood sampling on days 3 and 7 following the \nconclusion of study drug administration. If at any time the platelet count falls below 70% of \nthe last platelet count prior to cessation of study drug administration, with concomitant LDH > \n1.5 X ULN: the subject will be considered at risk of a relapse and she/he will need to be \nclosely monitored by the site staff. \nWhen practical and logistical circumstances prevail, the Investigator can decide to hospitalise \na subject for observation in order to facilitate the follow up during these 7 days post-study \ndrug treatment period. Such a hospitalisation, organised only for practical and logistic \nreasons and not triggered by clinical significant altered laboratory values nor by clinical signs \nor symptoms, should be considered as an elective hospitalisation to be captured as an \nadditional visit, and not as an AE or SAE (please refer to section 9.1.1).  \n \nAssessments scheduled in case of TTP relapse \nIn case of TTP relapse, defined as de novo event of TTP that occurs later than 30 days after \nthe last daily PE, the assessments described under \u201cdaily PE for the treatment of relapse\u201d \nare scheduled (see Table 14).

Clinically relevant bleeding is defined as moderate to severe (including life-threatening) bleeding requiring urgent medical and/or surgical intervention.  Modified ITP bleeding score Bleeding will also be measured using a modified version of the immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) bleeding score. The rationale for using a modified version of the ITP bleeding score is the following. Both the WHO bleeding scale and other bleeding scales used in the frame of cardiac intervention or treatment of venous thromboembolism include bleeding or blood loss requiring transfusion of packed RBC or whole blood as a severity factor. It is common for subjects undergoing PE to need transfusions, even without apparent bleeding. The ITP bleeding score27 does not include transfusion data. It is expected to be more sensitive than the other bleeding scales mentioned above. The modified ITP bleeding score is the sum of the scores for each line (Table 15).

If the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required. If an AE occurs during a washout or placebo run-in phase and afterwards worsens during the treatment phase, a new AE page must be filled in with the intensity observed during study drug administration. \u2022 Mild Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does not require intervention \u2022 Moderate Event may make subject uncomfortable; performance of daily activities may be influenced; intervention may be needed \u2022 Severe Event may cause noticeable discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or intervention is usually needed A mild, moderate or severe AE may or may not be serious. These terms are used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction).

For example, nausea lasting several hours may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious. Fever of 39\u00b0C that is not considered severe may become serious if it prolongs hospital discharge by a day (see Section 9.2.1.1).

The primary endpoint of time-to-response of blood markers (defined as time-to-response) is monitored in a survival setting.  Sample Size Calculation The time-to-response of blood markers is monitored in a survival setting. The primary endpoint time-to-response of blood markers comprises recovery of platelets \u2265 150,000/\u00b5L. Accrual period is taken as 1.5 years. Zero to time-to-event period is set at 30 days. As median time-to-response for the control group we take 6 days (this information is calculated based upon Bandarenko et al.28). For the treated group with ALX-0081 we assume a 44% risk reduction corresponding to a reduction in median time to event of 2.64 days, and ultimately resulting in a time-to-response of 3.36 days. The hazard ratio is defined in the SAS code as the hazard of control versus experimental (ALX-0081) treatment thus equalling to 6/3.36=1.786. The sample size calculations are performed based on a log-rank test, aiming for a power of 80%, tested 1-sided at 2.5% significance level with 1:1 randomisation. Note that we assume that 15% of subjects would be lost-to-follow-up. The latter is justifiable because the active follow-up period only equals 30 days. Based on the above described assumptions a sample size of 110 subjects is required.

Assessment of the primary endpoint is performed by using a one-sided log-rank test at 2.5% significance level. A Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis with time-to-response as the endpoint and treatment group as the independent variable, and stratified for absence/presence of one PE session prior to randomisation, will be performed on the ITT and PP populations. An observation is censored if the observation does not meet the defined time interval of 30 days after first administration of study drug medication, due to any cause of loss-to follow-up (including death), or endpoint not being reached within the defined time interval. The log-rank test is one-sided because inhibition by ALX-0081 of vWF is expected for all subjects. Indeed, as described in section 2.4.2, 100% of subjects receiving a SD s.c. injection of 8 mg already had inhibition of RICO up to a minimum of 18 hours.  ",

In the clinical setting of this trial investigating the acute phase of TTP, this occurrence is expected to be more frequent, with a more severe intensity of physical and/or mental incapacity. If local requirements, regulations and ethical committees allow, the study can be initiated prior to obtaining the informed consent, in case of physical or mental incapacity to consent and absence of a legal representative. As soon as possible, voluntary informed consent must be sought and obtained from these physically or mentally incapacitated subject, or legal representative, as applicable. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to assure that informed consent is obtained for each participant in accordance with Section 4.8 of the ICH consolidated guideline for GCP from July 1996, and local regulations. The signed informed consent will be retained with the study records. Each participant will receive a copy of the signed informed consent. The Investigator should maintain a log of all subjects who sign the informed consent form and indicate if the subject received study drug or, if not, the reason why.

INTRODUCTION  1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles. 3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, \"The health of my patient will be my first consideration,\" and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, \"A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.\" 5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research. 6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research subject must take precedence over all other interests. Document ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013Ablynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 123/127  \n7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand \nthe causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic \nand therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best \ncurrent interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, \neffectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. \n8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and \nburdens. \n9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human \nsubjects and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are \nparticularly vulnerable and need special protection. These include those who cannot \ngive or refuse consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion \nor undue influence. \n10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for \nresearch involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable \ninternational norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or \nregulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research \nsubjects set forth in this Declaration. \nB. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  \n11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, \nhealth, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of \npersonal information of research subjects. \n12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted \nscientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, \nother relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, \nanimal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  \n13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may \nharm the environment. \n14. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must \nbe clearly described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement \nof the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this \nDeclaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding \nfunding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest, \nincentives for subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who \nare harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. The protocol \nshould describe arrangements for post-study access by study subjects to \ninterventions identified as beneficial in the study or access to other appropriate care or \nbenefits. \n15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and \napproval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee \nmust be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It \nmust take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in \nwhich the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and \nstandards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections \nfor research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right \nto monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the \ncommittee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No change to \nthe protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee. \n16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals \nwith the appropriate scientific training and qualifications. Research on patients or \nhealthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified \nphysician or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of \nresearch subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care \nprofessional and never the research subjects, even though they have given consent. \nDocument ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013\nAblynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 124/127  \n17. Medical research involving a disadvantaged or vulnerable population or community is \nonly justified if the research is responsive to the health needs and priorities of this \npopulation or community and if there is a reasonable likelihood that this population or \ncommunity stands to benefit from the results of the research. \n18. Every medical research study involving human subjects must be preceded by careful \nassessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and communities \ninvolved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other \nindividuals or communities affected by the condition under investigation. \n19. Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before \nrecruitment of the first subject. \n20. Physicians may not participate in a research study involving human subjects unless \nthey are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be \nsatisfactorily managed. Physicians must immediately stop a study when the risks are \nfound to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of positive \nand beneficial results. \n21. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance \nof the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the research subjects. \n22. Participation by competent individuals as subjects in medical research must be \nvoluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community \nleaders, no competent individual may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she \nfreely agrees. \n23. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the \nconfidentiality of their personal information and to minimize the impact of the study on \ntheir physical, mental and social integrity. \n24. In medical research involving competent human subjects, each potential subject must \nbe adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible \nconflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits \nand potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, and any other relevant \naspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to \nparticipate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without \nreprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of \nindividual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. \nAfter ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician \nor another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject's \nfreely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be \nexpressed in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and \nwitnessed. \n25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must \nnormally seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may \nbe situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such \nresearch or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the \nresearch may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics \ncommittee. \n26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician \nshould be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship \nwith the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed \nconsent should be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely \nindependent of this relationship. \n27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek \ninformed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must \nnot be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it \nis intended to promote the health of the population represented by the potential \nsubject, the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the \nresearch entails only minimal risk and minimal burden. \nDocument ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013\nAblynx NV \nClinical Study Protocol \nStudy ALX-0681-2.1/10 \nJune 24, 2013 \nCONFIDENTIAL  \nPage 125/127  \n28. When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent \nto decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in \naddition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's \ndissent should be respected. \n29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving \nconsent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or \nmental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of \nthe research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed \nconsent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is \navailable and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without \ninformed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a \ncondition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the \nresearch protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. \nConsent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the \nsubject or a legally authorized representative. \n30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the \npublication of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available \nthe results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the \ncompleteness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted \nguidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results \nshould be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, \ninstitutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. \nReports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should \nnot be accepted for publication. \nC. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH \nMEDICAL CARE \n31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that \nthe research is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and \nif the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will \nnot adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects. \n32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested \nagainst those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following \ncircumstances: \n\u2022 \nThe use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven \nintervention exists; or  \n\u2022 \nWhere for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of \nplacebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the \npatients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious \nor irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. \n33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be \ninformed about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, \nfor example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other \nappropriate care or benefits. \n34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the \nresearch. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient's decision to \nwithdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient-physician relationship. \n35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been \nineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the \npatient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in \nthe physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or \nalleviating suffering. Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of \nresearch, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information \nshould be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available. \n22.10.2008 \nDocument ID: 25_A0068_13_0076          ADMS Version Number: 1.0          Printing Date: 08/Aug/2013\nAblynx NV Clinical Study Protocol Study ALX-0681-2.1/10 June 24, 2013 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 126/127  ",
