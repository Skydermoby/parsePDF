INTRODUCTION\n1.1. Indication\nPatients who have been treated in previous Pfizer sponsored oncology studies, with axitinib \neither as monotherapy or in combination with another anticancer drug.\n1.2. Background\nAxitinib is a substituted indazole derivative that has a direct antiangiogenic effect mediated \nby the potent inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-2; KDR) \nkinase activity.  Axitinib is also a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-1 (flt-1) and VEGFR-3.  \nAxitinib is currently being investigated as an anticancer agent in a series of clinical trials.  \nAxitinib studies have been designed with a maximum number of cycles or time that a patient \ncan be on the trial.  Some patients may be deriving benefit from the drug and want to have \ncontinued access to this investigational agent.  This protocol will provide continued access to \naxitinib tablets to patients who were assigned to an axitinib-containing treatment arm in an \naxitinib clinical trial.\nThe background relevant to the study drug(s) given in combination with axitinib, if \napplicable, is described in the parent protocol(s) attached in the Appendix 1.  \n1.2.1. Molecular Formula and Molecular Activity\nAxitinib is a substituted indazole derivative that was discovered using structure-based drug \ndesign.  The molecular formula is C22H18N4OS with molecular weight of 386.47.  The \nchemical name is \nN-Methyl-2-[3-((E)-2-pyridin-2-yl-vinyl)-1H-indazol-6-ylsulfanyl]-benzamide: \nH\nN\nN\nS\nC O N H Me\nN\nThe mechanism of action of axitinib is a direct anti-angiogenic effect mediated by the potent \ninhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2; KDR) kinase activity.  \nAxitinib is also a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-1 (flt-1) and VEGFR-3.\nAxitinib (AG-013736)\nProtocol A4061008\nFinal Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 13\n1.2.2. Scope of Axitinib Clinical Program\nClinical trials with axitinib in cancer patients were initiated in April 2002.  The ongoing \nclinical program is designed to test the safety and efficacy of axitinib, either as a single-agent \nor in combination with other anti-tumor agents, in a variety of advanced solid tumors.\nTumor types under study include, but are not limited to, advanced RCC, advanced NSCLC, \nHCC, advanced gastric cancer, and other solid tumors.  Refer to the most recent version of IB \nfor complete list of closed and ongoing studies, and the most updated information on the \nclinical program.\n1.2.2.1. Overall Clinical Safety of Axitinib\nAs of 01 June 2012, a total of 4372 patients were enrolled into clinical studies in the axitinib \nclinical program and included in the safety (serious adverse event) database.  Of these, \n3075 patients received axitinib.  In total, 2543 patients with cancer received either \nsingle-agent axitinib or axitinib in combination with chemotherapy.  In addition, 516 healthy \nvolunteers and 16 patients with hepatic impairment received single agent axitinib.\nA complete overview of safety and additional information on axitinib can be found in the \nmost current version of the Investigator\u2019s Brochure (IB).\nOverall, the adverse events reported in axitinib clinical studies are considered manageable \nand were generally reversible and expected for this class of agents.  For single-agent axitinib, \nthe most common adverse events reported from 699 cancer patients regardless of causality \nincluded diarrhea (397 patients, 56.8%), fatigue (368 patients, 52.6%), hypertension \n(318 patients, 45.5%), decrease appetite (286 patients, 40.9%), nausea (264 patients, 37.8%), \ndysphonia (242 patients, 34.6%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (202 patients, \n28.9%), weight decreased (197 patients, 28.2%), vomiting (166 patients, 23.7%), \nconstipation (165 patients, 23.6%), headache (151 patients, 21.6%), cough (149 patients, \n21.3%), arthralgia and dyspnea (140 patients, 20%).  Additionally, hypothyroidism and \nproteinuria were reported as adverse events in 122 patients (17.5%) and 117 patients \n(16.7 %), respectively.  Grade 3+ events occurred most frequently for hypertension \n(134 patients, 19.2%), fatigue (90 patients, 12.9%), and diarrhea (65 patients, 9.3%).\nIn patients with solid tumors who received single-agent axitinib from completed studies, the \nmajority of the hematological test abnormalities were Grade 1 and 2, however 53 patients \n(7.9%) reported Grade 3 lymphocytopenia, and the following Grade 3 or 4 events were \nreported: 9 patients (1.3%) hemoglobin decreased, 9 patients (1.3%) neutrophils decreased,\n3 patients (0.4%) white blood cells decreased, 2 patients (0.3%) platelets decreased.  As per \nclinical chemistry, Grade 3 or 4 lipase abnormalities were reported in 26 patients (7%), \nhyponatremia in 34 patients (5%), hyperglycemia in 23 patients (3.3%), hyperkalemia in \n22 patients (3.2%), elevations in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase in 13 patients (1.9%), total bilirubin \nincrease in 5 patients (0.7%), and creatinine increased in 4 patients (0.6%).  For urinalysis, \nGrade 3 proteinuria was reported in 24 patients (3.4%).\nAxitinib (AG-013736)\nProtocol A4061008\nFinal Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 14\nIn Phase 3 study A4061032, hypothyroidism was reported in 69/359 patients (19%) receiving \naxitinib.  Hyperthyroidism was reported in 4/359 patients (1%).  In patients who had thyroid \nstimulating hormone (TSH) <5 \u03bcU/mL before treatment, elevations of TSH to \u226510 \u03bcU/mL \noccurred in 79/245 patients (32%) receiving axitinib.  Monitoring thyroid function before \ninitiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with axitinib is recommended.  \nHypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism should be treated according to standard medical \npractice to maintain euthyroid state.\n1.2.2.2. Overall Clinical Safety of Combination Drug (if applicable)\nAn overview of safety and information on study drug(s) given in combination with the \nAxitinib is available in the parent protocol(s) in the Appendix 1. \nAdditional information for the study drug(s) may be found in the Single Reference Safety \nDocument, which for this study are the current Investigator Brochure (IBs).\n1.3. Rationale\nSome patients in axitinib clinical trials may be experiencing clinical benefit from axitinib\neither as monotherapy or in combination with another anticancer drug and may wish to \ncontinue treatment following completion of the trial.  Such patients, after a written \nre-consent, may continue to receive axitinib and the combination study drug (if applicable) at \nthe same dose and schedule as specified in their prior axitinib protocol, with the consensus of \nthe principal investigator and the approval of the sponsor company until patients no longer \nexperience clinical benefit, develop unacceptable toxicity or withdraw consent.\nComplete information for the study drug(s) may be found in the Single Reference Safety \nDocuments, which for this study are the current Investigator Brochures.\n2. TRIAL OBJECTIVES\nThe objective of the trial is to provide continued access to axitinib tablets and to the study \ndrug(s) given in combination (if applicable) to patients who have completed their \nparticipation in a prioraxitinib monotherapy or combination study and who have documented \nstable disease, responding disease or clinical benefit as described below at the time they \ndiscontinued from the previous trial.\n3. TRIAL DESIGN\nAxitinib trials (either monotherapy or combination) have been designed with a maximum \nnumber of treatment cycles.  However, some patients may be deriving clinical benefit from \nthe drug(s) and want to continue treatment with the investigational agent(s) but are unable to \ncontinue in their present trial.\nThis protocol will provide continued access to axitinib tablets and the combination study \ndrug(s) if applicable for patients who were assigned to an axitinib-containing treatment arm \nin an axitinib clinical trial.  For patients in combination treatment, if axitinib is interrupted \ndue to toxicity, the continuation of the combination drug will be evaluated on a case by case \nanalysis after discussion with the Sponsor (based on the benefit risk assessment and other \navailable options).  \nAxitinib (AG-013736)\nProtocol A4061008\nFinal Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 15\nTo be eligible for this trial, patients must have been receiving axitinib tablets (as either \nmonotherapy or combination as applicable) at the time their previous trial ended and have \nhad Stable Disease (SD) or responding disease (PR or CR) according to the disease response \ncriteria in the previous axitinib trial.  Patients who have Progressive Disease (PD) but \ncontinue to  experience clinical benefit in previous axitinib study will be eligible for \nenrollment; in this case, clinical benefit is defined as the Sum of Longest Diameters (SLD) of \nmeasurable lesions remaining less than or equal to the baseline SLD in the previous axitinib \ntrial.  These patients must not be eligible for treatment with other available approved therapy \nfor the disease under study.  These patients will be allowed to continue receiving study \ntreatment(s) until the SLD of measurable lesions becomes greater than the baseline SLD in \nthe previous trial.\nDuring treatment on this protocol, all patients will be evaluated for safety and monitored per \nlocal standard clinical practice.  Axitinib dosing or combination therapy, if applicable) and \nconcomitant treatments will be monitored.  Follow up information on alive/death status will \nbe collected every two months starting from last study visit.  Efficacy parameters will not be \nevaluated as part of this protocol.  Pending drug availability, patients may continue to receive \naxitinib tablets or combination therapy (if applicable) until the axitinib development program \nis terminated or when they are no longer receiving benefit (defined as no longer having stable \nor responding disease according to institutional standards), or clinical benefit for eligible \npatients with PD as previously defined.  \n4. PATIENT SELECTION\nThis clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patients are enrolled.  The \nfollowing eligibility criteria are designed to select patients for whom protocol treatment is \nconsidered appropriate.  All relevant medical and non-medical conditions should be taken \ninto consideration when deciding whether this protocol is suitable for a particular patient.\n4.1. Inclusion Criteria\nPatient eligibility should be reviewed and documented by an appropriately qualified member \nof the investigator\u2019s study team before patients are included in the study.\nPatients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the \ntrial:\n\uf0b7\nPatients who were assigned to an axitinib-containing treatment arm in a previous \nclinical trial.\n\uf0b7\nPatients who were receiving axitinib tablets at the time their previous trial ended.\n\uf0b7\nPatients who have stable (SD) or responding disease (PR or CR) documented by the \nappropriate radiological, clinical, or laboratory assessments within 12 weeks before \nenrollment (Note: response criteria from the previous axitinib protocol should be used \nto determine stable or responding disease).\nAxitinib (AG-013736)\nProtocol A4061008\nFinal Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 16\n\uf0b7\nPatients who have Progressive Disease (PD) but have experienced clinical benefit \nfrom previous axitinib treatment will be eligible for enrollment; in this case, clinical \nbenefit is defined as the Sum of Longest Diameters (SLD) of measurable lesions \nremaining less than or equal to the baseline SLD in the previous axitinib trial.  These \npatients must not be eligible for treatment with other available approved therapy for \nthe disease under study.  The Pfizer clinician must approve the enrollment prior to \ntreatment start. \n\uf0b7\nPatients who are informed of, and willing and able to comply with the investigational \nnature of the trial, and have signed a written informed consent in accordance with \ninstitutional and ICH GCP guidelines.\n4.2. Exclusion Criteria\nPatients presenting with any of the following will not be included in the trial:\n\uf0b7\nPatients may not participate in this trial if the conditions for continuing treatment in \nthe previous axitinib protocol are not met. \n4.3. Life Style Guidelines\nAll male and female patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, are biologically capable \nof having children and are sexually active, must agree to use a highly effective method of \ncontraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the active treatment period and \nfor 90 days  after the last dose of investigational product.  The investigator, in consultation \nwith the patient, will select the most appropriate method of contraception for the individual \npatient from the permitted list of contraception methods, and instruct the patient in its \nconsistent and correct use.  The investigator, at each study visit, will confirm and document \nconsistent and correct use.  In addition, the investigator will instruct the patient to call \nimmediately if the selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or \nsuspected. \nHighly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a \nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and \ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.\n2. Correctly placed intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).\n3. Male condom or female condom used WITH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, \nsuppository).\n4. Male sterilization with appropriately confirmed absence of sperm in the \npost-vasectomy ejaculate.\nAxitinib (AG-013736)\nProtocol A4061008\nFinal Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 17\n5. Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy.\nOnly for patients previously enrolled in the parent protocol A4061068 and under \ntreatment with axitinib and crizotinib the following additional guideline is to be \nfollowed:\nSunlight Exposure\nPatients will be advised to report any reaction to sun exposed skin. In addition, special \nprecaution will be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the \npatients\u2019 exposure to light including high intensity ultraviolet B light (UVB) sources such as \ntanning beds, tanning booths and sunlumps. Patients should be encouraged to apply \nsunscreen/sunblock daily.\n4.4. Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the \nstudy is documented in the study contact list located in the \u201cStudy Team on Demand\u201d\n(SToD).\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical \nquestions or problems, participants are provided with a contact card.  The contact card \ncontains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, participant numbers, \ncontact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the \nevent that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical \nquestion or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the \nparticipant\u2019s participation in the study.  The contact number can also be used by investigator \nstaff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used \nonly in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site \nand the study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the \nestablished communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team for \nadvice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study.  The contact \nnumber is not intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls that \nnumber, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site.\n5. TRIAL TREATMENTS\n5.1. Allocation to Treatment (Axitinib and Combination Drug, if applicable)\nThis trial is open label.  All patients will receive axitinib either as monotherapy or in \ncombination with other study drug(s) according to the indications reported in the parent\nprotocol (Appendix 1). The dose and the schedule of axitinib and of the study drug(s) given \nin combination (if applicable) will be the same as they were taking in the previous trial.\n",

Dose Reduction for Hypertension (Axitinib Monotherapy)\nPatients treated with axitinib will be issued blood pressure cuffs (provided by Pfizer) for \nhome monitoring and instructed to measure their blood pressure (BP) twice daily, prior to \ntaking each dose.  All blood pressure measurements will be recorded in a diary and brought \nto the nurse or study coordinator at each clinic visit for review.  Patients should be instructed \nby the study staff to contact their physician immediately for guidance if their systolic blood \npressure rises above 150 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure rises above 100 mm Hg, or if they \ndevelop symptoms perceived to be related to elevated BP (eg, headache, visual disturbance).  \nSee below for dose modifications for hypertension.\nNew or additional antihypertensive therapy (See Section 5.4, Concomitant Medication(s) for \nguidance) should be started if 2 blood pressure readings, taken in the clinic and separated by \nat least 1 hour, show the following: 2 systolic blood pressure readings greater than 150 or \n2 diastolic blood pressure readings greater than 100 mm Hg.  Alternately, the dose of existing \nantihypertensive medication(s) may be increased.  Note: the early introduction of \nantihypertensive agents for Grade 1 and Grade 2 hypertension in order to minimize the \noccurrence of more severe or persistent hypertension while undergoing treatment with \naxitinib will not constitute a Grade 3 toxicity.\nIf the patient is already on maximal antihypertensive treatment, the study drug should be \nreduced by 1 dose level.\nPatients on maximal antihypertensive treatment (to be defined on an individual patient basis \naccording to the judgment of the investigator, but may include up to 4 anti-hypertensive \nmedications given for 2 weeks) who have 2 systolic blood pressure readings, separated by at \nleast 1 hour, greater than 160 mm Hg, or 2 diastolic blood pressure readings, separated by at \nleast 1 hour, greater than 105 mm Hg, will have treatment with axitinib held.  (Note: if study \ndrug is held, patients receiving antihypertensive medications should monitor closely for \nhypotension). \nBlood pressure may decrease within 24 hours of stopping therapy.  Blood pressure \nmeasurements used to decide to discontinue or interrupt axitinib dosing or to adjust \nantihypertensive medications should be done in the clinic.  Plasma half-life of axitinib is \n2-4 hours and BP usually decreases within 1-2 days following dose interruption. \nTreatment with axitinib should be restarted at 1 lower dose level, rounded down to \naccommodate dosage form availability, after the systolic blood pressure reduces to less than \n150 mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure reduces to less than 100 mm Hg.\nPatients who develop recurrent systolic hypertension (2 BP readings separated by at least \n1 hour show systolic pressure >150 mm Hg) or recurrent diastolic BP >100 mm Hg \nfollowing previous study drug dose reduction should undergo another dose reduction by one \ndose level.  If a patient requires dose reduction below 2 mg BID, contact Sponsor for \ndiscussion.  Blood pressure measurements used for axitinib-discontinuation decision-making \nshould be done in the clinic. \n",

The molecular formula is C22H18N4OS with molecular weight of 386.47.  The chemical name is N-Methyl-2-[3-((E)-2-pyridin-2-yl-vinyl)-1H-indazol-6-ylsulfanyl]-benzamide: HNNSC O N H MeNThe mechanism of action of axitinib is a direct anti-angiogenic effect mediated by the potent inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2; KDR) kinase activity.  Axitinib is also a potent inhibitor of VEGFR-1 (flt-1) and VEGFR-3.Axitinib (AG-013736)Protocol A4061008Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 13",

Of these, 3075 patients received axitinib.  In total, 2543 patients with cancer received either single-agent axitinib or axitinib in combination with chemotherapy.  In addition, 516 healthy volunteers and 16 patients with hepatic impairment received single agent axitinib.A complete overview of safety and additional information on axitinib can be found in the most current version of the Investigator\u2019s Brochure (IB).Overall, the adverse events reported in axitinib clinical studies are considered manageable and were generally reversible and expected for this class of agents.  For single-agent axitinib, the most common adverse events reported from 699 cancer patients regardless of causality included diarrhea (397 patients, 56.8%), fatigue (368 patients, 52.6%), hypertension (318 patients, 45.5%), decrease appetite (286 patients, 40.9%), nausea (264 patients, 37.8%), dysphonia (242 patients, 34.6%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (202 patients, 28.9%), weight decreased (197 patients, 28.2%), vomiting (166 patients, 23.7%), constipation (165 patients, 23.6%), headache (151 patients, 21.6%), cough (149 patients, 21.3%), arthralgia and dyspnea (140 patients, 20%).  Additionally, hypothyroidism and proteinuria were reported as adverse events in 122 patients (17.5%) and 117 patients (16.7 %), respectively.  Grade 3+ events occurred most frequently for hypertension (134 patients, 19.2%), fatigue (90 patients, 12.9%), and diarrhea (65 patients, 9.3%).In patients with solid tumors who received single-agent axitinib from completed studies, the majority of the hematological test abnormalities were Grade 1 and 2, however 53 patients (7.9%) reported Grade 3 lymphocytopenia, and the following Grade 3 or 4 events were reported: 9 patients (1.3%) hemoglobin decreased, 9 patients (1.3%) neutrophils decreased,3 patients (0.4%) white blood cells decreased, 2 patients (0.3%) platelets decreased.  As per clinical chemistry, Grade 3 or 4 lipase abnormalities were reported in 26 patients (7%), hyponatremia in 34 patients (5%), hyperglycemia in 23 patients (3.3%), hyperkalemia in 22 patients (3.2%), elevations in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase in 13 patients (1.9%), total bilirubin increase in 5 patients (0.7%), and creatinine increased in 4 patients (0.6%).  For urinalysis, Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 24 patients (3.4%).Axitinib (AG-013736)Protocol A4061008Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 14In Phase 3 study A4061032, hypothyroidism was reported in 69/359 patients (19%) receiving axitinib.  Hyperthyroidism was reported in 4/359 patients (1%).  In patients who had thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) <5 \u03bcU/mL before treatment, elevations of TSH to \u226510 \u03bcU/mL occurred in 79/245 patients (32%) receiving axitinib.  Monitoring thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with axitinib is recommended.  Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism should be treated according to standard medical practice to maintain euthyroid state.",

All blood pressure measurements will be recorded in a diary and brought to the nurse or study coordinator at each clinic visit for review.  Patients should be instructed by the study staff to contact their physician immediately for guidance if their systolic blood pressure rises above 150 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure rises above 100 mm Hg, or if they develop symptoms perceived to be related to elevated BP (eg, headache, visual disturbance).  See below for dose modifications for hypertension.New or additional antihypertensive therapy (See Section 5.4, Concomitant Medication(s) for guidance) should be started if 2 blood pressure readings, taken in the clinic and separated by at least 1 hour, show the following: 2 systolic blood pressure readings greater than 150 or 2 diastolic blood pressure readings greater than 100 mm Hg.  Alternately, the dose of existing antihypertensive medication(s) may be increased.  Note: the early introduction of antihypertensive agents for Grade 1 and Grade 2 hypertension in order to minimize the occurrence of more severe or persistent hypertension while undergoing treatment with axitinib will not constitute a Grade 3 toxicity.If the patient is already on maximal antihypertensive treatment, the study drug should be reduced by 1 dose level.Patients on maximal antihypertensive treatment (to be defined on an individual patient basis according to the judgment of the investigator, but may include up to 4 anti-hypertensive medications given for 2 weeks) who have 2 systolic blood pressure readings, separated by at least 1 hour, greater than 160 mm Hg, or 2 diastolic blood pressure readings, separated by at least 1 hour, greater than 105 mm Hg, will have treatment with axitinib held.  (Note: if study drug is held, patients receiving antihypertensive medications should monitor closely for hypotension). Blood pressure may decrease within 24 hours of stopping therapy.  Blood pressure measurements used to decide to discontinue or interrupt axitinib dosing or to adjust antihypertensive medications should be done in the clinic.  Plasma half-life of axitinib is 2-4 hours and BP usually decreases within 1-2 days following dose interruption. Treatment with axitinib should be restarted at 1 lower dose level, rounded down to accommodate dosage form availability, after the systolic blood pressure reduces to less than 150 mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure reduces to less than 100 mm Hg.Patients who develop recurrent systolic hypertension (2 BP readings separated by at least 1 hour show systolic pressure >150 mm Hg) or recurrent diastolic BP >100 mm Hg following previous study drug dose reduction should undergo another dose reduction by one dose level.

Low-dose oral steroids (defined as \uf0a35 mg per day prednisone or equivalent) or topical or inhaled steroids at any dose may be taken during the study.  The therapeutic use of colony-stimulating factors is a matter of clinical judgment.  Prophylactic use is permitted in patients who have experienced infection or grade 4 neutropenia during the previous cycle.  If colony stimulating factors are given, use should be consistent with product labeling and should be documented in the patient's medical record. In vitro studies with human liver microenzymes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes indicated that axitinib metabolism was primarily mediated by the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and UGT1A1.  Clinically, there is likelihood that axitinib plasma concentrations may be increased in the presence of co-administered strong inhibitors of CYP3A.  The potential exists for drug-drug interactions with CYP3A inhibitors such as grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, verapamil, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, and delavirdine.  Caution should be exercised in patients receiving axitinib in combination with these and other strong CYP3A inhibitors Axitinib metabolism may be induced in patients taking CYP3A4 inducers (carbamazepine, dexamethasone, felbamate, omeprazole, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, and St John\u2019s wort) and this may reduce axitinib plasma concentrations.  Patients who require concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A inducers are not eligible for the trial.  Since CYP1A2 is also known to be induced in chronic smokers, there is likelihood that axitinib plasma concentrations may be reduced in these individuals. Axitinib (AG-013736)\nProtocol A4061008\nFinal Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 24\nThe ability of axitinib to increase concentrations of co-administered drugs was also \ninvestigated in studies with human liver microsomes.  At expected therapeutic plasma \nconcentrations (0.01 to 1.0 \u00b5g/mL), axitinib appears most likely to inhibit the drug \nmetabolizing enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C8, 2 enzymes not frequently observed as \npredominant drug metabolizing enzymes.  However co-administration of axitinib with \npaclitaxel, a CYP2C8 substrate did not increase plasma concentrations of paclitaxel in \npatients, indicating lack of clinical CYP2C8 inhibition.  Axitinib is highly bound to proteins \nin human plasma (99.5% bound at concentrations of 0.2 to 20 \u00b5g/mL).  Therefore, drug \ninteractions with other agents that are also highly bound to plasma proteins are a possibility.\nPatients who need to be on chronic antacid therapy with histamine H2 antagonists (eg, \ncimetidine [Tagamet\u00ae], famotidine [Pepcid\u00ae], nizatidine [Axid\u00ae], ranitidine [Zantac\uf0d2]) or \nproton-pump inhibitors (eg, lansoprazole [Prevacid\u00ae], rabeprazole [Aciphex\u00ae ], pantoprazole \n[Protonix\u00ae], and esomeprazole [Nexium\u00ae]) or locally acting antacids (eg, Maalox\u00ae, Milk of \nMagnesia\u00ae, Amphojel\u00ae) should stagger the timing of their axitinib and antacid dosing.  \nPatients should avoid use of antacids for 2 hours before through 2 hours after taking axitinib \ntablets. \nAxitinib is not likely to have drug-drug interactions with commonly used antihypertensive \nagents belonging to the class of ACE inhibitors including angiotensin II receptor antagonists \n(enalapril, captopril, losartan, vasartan), beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, labetalol), or \ndiuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide).  Within the class of calcium channel blockers, \nverapamil, and to a lesser extent nifedipine, nicardipine, and diltiazem have a potential for \nincreasing axitinib plasma concentrations, due to CYP3A inhibition and should not be used \nas first choice in antihypertensive treatment.  Other calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, \nbepridil, felodipine) are less likely to raise axitinib plasma levels.  The above information is \nbased on preclinical data from studies using human and animal metabolizing enzyme \nsystems.\nPatients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy during treatment with axitinib should be \ntreated with low molecular weight heparin as the preferred therapy. \nAll concomitant medications and blood products, as well as interventions (eg, analgesic use \nor paracentesis) received by patients from the first dose of study drug until the end of study \nvisit will be recorded on the case report form (eCRF).\nRegarding the concomitant surgery, no formal studies of the effect of axitinib on wound \nhealing have been conducted, however caution is advise based on the mechanism of action. \nIf a major surgery or an interventional procedure (eg, endoscopy) is required, treatment with \naxitinib must be interrupted at least 24 hours before the procedure. \nPatients may resume the treatment with axitinib according to the opinion of the investigator, \nwhen wound has completely healed and there are no wound healing complications (eg,\ndelayed healing, wound infection or fistula).\nAxitinib (AG-013736)Protocol A4061008Final Protocol Amendment #7, 08 November 2018PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 25",
