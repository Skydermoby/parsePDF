                "Content": " RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND: Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by dissociation of the transthyretin tetramer into monomers, which misfold, ultimately forming amyloid deposits in various organs. This structural instability of the TTR tetramer can occur due to genetic mutations of the gene encoding the TTR protein or can be associated with aging. There are over 120 known mutations of TTR gene, which result in variable phenotypic expressions of amyloidosis that commonly affect the peripheral nerves, heart, kidney or eye. The Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS) is a longitudinal, observational survey open to all patients with TTR gene mutations without a diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis and to patients diagnosed with ATTR amyloidosis (inclusive of ATTR-PN and ATTR-CM). To date, limited data are available on the natural history of the hereditary (ATTRm) and wild-type (ATTRwt) forms of the disease, including the regional differences in disease expression by TTR variants and non-mutated TTR, and the genotypic-phenotypic relationship in ATTR amyloidosis. The principal aims of the outcome survey are to better understand and characterize the natural history of the disease by studying a large and heterogeneous patient population. Survey data may be used to develop new treatment guidelines and recommendations, and to inform and educate clinicians about the management of this disease. The survey can also generate descriptive safety summaries using adverse and serious adverse event (AE/SAE) data in tafamidis-treated participants. RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES: The objectives of THAOS are to describe the population of patients affected with ATTR amyloidosis and to enhance the understanding of the disease natural history, including the variability and progression of the hereditary and acquired forms of disease. STUDY DESIGN: THAOS is a non-interventional, global, multi-center, longitudinal observational survey open to all patients with ATTR amyloidosis, including both inherited and wild-type forms of disease, and participants with TTR gene mutations without disease diagnosis. There is no set number of patients who will be enrolled. The study has been open since 2007 and will continue until Pfizer declares the study complete (currently estimated to be the year 2023) or as long as patients are able to participate, or until they withdraw consent. THAOS does not involve the administration of an investigational agent or other intervention. Patients will continue to receive their current medications and all other standard care for their disease. It is recommended that patient assessments be conducted at least annually and be recorded in the THAOS electronic data record close to the time they are performed. PF-06291826, Tafamidis meglumine \nB3461001 NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL \nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 July 2020 \nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL \nPage 10 \n \n \nTreatment with tafamidis or with other disease modifying therapies will be according to the \nproduct label with commercially available product or according to protocol-specified \nrequirements if a participant is enrolled in a tafamidis interventional study. \nIn addition to routine procedures for standard of care, patients will be asked to complete \npatient outcome questionnaires at least annually; these are optional and do not affect a \npatient\u2019s eligibility to participate in the survey. \nThe survey will be conducted at sites worldwide. \nPOPULATION: The study population includes patients with confirmed hereditary or \nwild-type ATTR amyloidosis and those with TTR gene mutation without a diagnosis of \nATTR amyloidosis. \nVARIABLES: A series of assessments will be used to assess disease progression and the \neffects of tafamidis treatment including patient demographics, TTR genetic test results, \nfamily disease history, medical history, annual medical assessment, general examination, \nconcomitant medications, hospitalizations, transplant history and complications, AE/SAE \nreporting for tafamidis-treated subjects, events of interest, clinical laboratory data, urinalysis, \ncardiovascular assessments, neurologic assessments, eye examination, body composition, \n \nDATA SOURCES: A computer-based application will be used for entering data into the \nTHAOS electronic data record, allowing sites to enter data remotely through locally secured \nconnections. The THAOS electronic data record allows for data to be recorded from an \neligibility/baseline visit, at return visits, and in the form of status updates if the patient has \nnot visited the site. In addition, THAOS physicians have the option of recording pre-baseline \nretrospective patient data. Final data entry (the entry of a status update indicating that the \npatient has been discontinued) will occur when the survey is completed, if the patient dies, or \nelects to discontinue the survey. \nSTUDY SIZE: There is no pre-determined number of enrolled patients or participating sites \nin THAOS. \nDATA ANALYSIS: Analysis of clinical outcomes will be conducted on all enrolled patients \nwith available data. Outcomes will be examined for the entire patient group, as well as \nthrough stratification of important variables that may affect outcomes (for example, but not \nlimited to, TTR data, age, race, gender, country of origin). Outcomes will include results of \nthe key clinical, functional and Patient Reported Outcome assessments used to define \nprogression of disease. \nMILESTONES: Safety data required as part of the European Medicines Agency Risk \nManagement Plan (RMP) for tafamidis will be analyzed annually for submission to the \nrelevant regulatory authorities. \n \nand patient death. \nCCI \nPF-06291826, Tafamidis meglumine B3461001 NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL Final Protocol Amendment 5, 13 July 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 11   ",

Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) is a rare disease caused by destabilization and dissociation of the native TTR tetramer into monomers, which can result in misfolding and the formation of amyloid fibrils in various organs in amounts sufficient to impair normal functioning.1-5 The 2 major phenotypes which form the spectrum of ATTR amyloidosis are transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (), formerly referred to as transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP), which primarily affects the peripheral and autonomic nerves, and transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) which primarily affects the myocardium. These clinical manifestations may occur in isolation or together. Both result in progressively impaired function, and ultimately in death. There are over 130 known mutations of TTR gene,4 which result in variable phenotypic expressions of amyloidosis that commonly affect the peripheral nerves, heart, kidney or eye.6,7  The hereditary forms of ATTR amyloidosis are autosomal dominantly inherited diseases8,9 with a variable penetrance that can affect multiple generations in a family and have a substantial impact on patients and their families.

Sensory neuropathy typically starts in the lower extremities followed by motor neuropathy within a few years.8,10,11 Autonomic neuropathy quite often accompanies the sensory and motor deficits.12 ATTR-PN is more frequently observed in certain areas of Portugal, Sweden, and Japan but has been identified throughout the world.11 Although penetrance varies greatly among geographic and ethnic foci, the outcome of the disease is invariably progressive and fatal. The lifespan for patients is severely shortened, with death occurring within a mean of 10-15 years from the first symptoms.14,1 Disease-modifying therapies for ATTR-PN include TTR stabilizer tafamidis,30 orthotopic liver transplantation,13-15 RNA interference (RNAi)-based drugs, and transthyretin-directed antisense oligonucleotide drugs. Tafamidis meglumine was approved in the European Union (EU) on 16 November 2011 for the treatment of ATTR in adult patients with Stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment. Currently, it is approved for ATTR-PN in over 40 countries worldwide. Subsequently, Tegsedi (inotersen) and Onpattro (patisiran) for the treatment of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis in patients with polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) have also been approved in the EU and US.16-18 Tafamidis is a novel specific stabilizer of both tetrameric wild-type (w-t) TTR and of amyloidogenic variants of TTR (ATTR). By binding to the native tetrameric form of TTR, tafamidis inhibits tetramer dissociation, the rate limiting step in the formation of TTR amyloid. By inhibiting TTR amyloid formation, this novel class of TTR stabilizer drug has the potential to disrupt the progression of ATTR. The specificity of the binding to TTR also limits tafamidis to the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis only, with no activity anticipated for other types of amyloidosis. Tafamidis slows the progression of disease and therefore represents a disease modifying therapy.   occurs when the amyloid fibrils infiltrate the myocardium, leading to diastolic dysfunction progressing to, heart failure, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and death.19 , also known as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC), is a late-onset disease with symptoms typically occurring in patients over 60 years old.20 This disease can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutation in the TTR gene (commonly the Val122Ile mutation which occurs with high frequency [prevalence of 3.9%]22 in African-Americans); however, a mutation in TTR gene is not a pre-requisite for developing ",

To date, limited data are available on the natural history of the hereditary (ATTRm) and wild-type (ATTRwt) forms of the disease, including the regional differences in disease expression by TTR variants and non-mutated TTR, and the genotypic-phenotypic relationship in ATTR amyloidosis. The principal aims of the outcome survey are to better understand and characterize the natural history of the disease by studying a large and heterogeneous patient population. Survey data may be used to develop new treatment guidelines and recommendations, and to inform and educate clinicians about the management of this disease. The survey can also generate descriptive safety summaries using adverse and serious adverse event (AE/SAE) data in tafamidis-treated participants. All AE/SAE data will be collected and summarized, including (but not limited to) the safety concerns detailed in Table 1, Summary of Safety Concerns to be Assessed in THAOS.

If the investigator determines that a patient\u2019s decisional capacity is so limited that he or she cannot reasonably be consulted, then, as permitted by the IRB/IEC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, the patient\u2019s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained. If the study patient does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record why the patient did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient\u2019s legally acceptable representative, the consent signer\u2019s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent, spouse), and that the patient\u2019s assent was obtained or waived. If assent is obtained verbally, it must be documented in the source documents. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each patient or the patient\u2019s legally acceptable representative before any study-specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent/assent document. ",

An exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if a female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been directly exposed to (eg, environmental exposure) tafamidis, or the female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly exposed to tafamidis (maternal exposure). 2. An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). As a general rule, prospective and retrospective EDP reports from any source are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE and the procedures for SAE reporting should be followed. If a study participant becomes, or is found to be, pregnant during the study participant\u2019s treatment with tafamidis, this information must be submitted to Pfizer, irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred, using the NIS AEM Report Form and the EDP Supplemental Form, and through the Tafamidis Enhanced Surveillance for Pregnancy Outcomes (TESPO). Reporting to TESPO for women exposed to tafamidis will also include a 6-month and 12-month post-birth follow-up questionnaire regarding developmental milestones. In addition, the information regarding environmental exposure to tafamidis in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) must be submitted using the NIS AEM Report Form and the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred. Information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy; in addition, follow-up is conducted to obtain information on EDP outcome for all EDP reports with pregnancy outcome unknown. A pregnancy is followed until completion or until pregnancy termination (eg, induced abortion) and Pfizer is notified of the outcome.

In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the procedures for reporting SAEs should be followed. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: \u2022 Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; \u2022 Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to investigational product. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested.
