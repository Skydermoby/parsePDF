                "Content": " Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare tumours with an incidence of 2-3/100.000. Overall, STS account for approximately 1% of all malignancies, while they give rise to 2% of the total cancer-related mortality. Sarcomas constitute a heterogeneous group of rare tumours arising from cells of connective tissues (Clark MA et al, 2005). The gender distribution is equal. STS arise from mesodermal or ectodermal tissues and therefore occur at any site of the extremities, trunk, retroperitoneum or head and neck. There are multiple histological subtypes of STS. At present all these subtypes are usually grouped under the heading of STS for the purpose of treatment, although an increasing number of new treatment options are expected to be directed more specifically at individual histological subtypes. Currently, more than half of all patients die within 5 years of primary diagnosis, mostly due to metastatic disease involving the lungs. About 10% of the patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, whereas 40-60% of patients with localized, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma will develop metastases, predominantly in the lungs, despite local control of the tumour. Median survival from the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease is 8 to 12 months. According to the EUROCARE data (Ref.) the 5-year survival in Europe of adult STS (excluding visceral ones) averages 60%, with substantial geographic variations. Thus further improvements in the treatment outcome of these rare tumours are needed. ",

                        "Content": " Local surgery is usually the first line of management. Standard treatment is generally a wide surgical excision of the primary tumour combined with adjuvant radiotherapy, whenever feasible, or in some cases radical surgery, i.e. compartmental resection or amputation of the extremity. Partly because of the presence of a misleading pseudo membrane and a multifocal origin of the tumour, surgery was initially followed by a very high incidence of local recurrence. Nowadays, the addition of post-operative radiotherapy appears to reduce the rate of local recurrence significantly. However, even an optimal local treatment does not prevent the occurrence of distant metastases in some of the patients \u2013 especially those with high-grade tumours. Although the effect adjuvant chemotherapy has been studied by several groups, they did not allow any final conclusions. A recent international meta-analysis indicated an effect on progression free survival but no effect on overall survival. STS metastasise primarily to the lungs but also to bone, liver and other organs depending on the subtype. The median survival is generally less than 12 months, though long term survival may follow optimal response to chemotherapy in a limited number of patients. Chemotherapy is widely used in the treatment of advanced disease, basically with a palliative intent, but with the present knowledge its effect is clearly inadequate. Only few drugs have shown single-agent activity above 15% with the most active being doxorubicin, epirubicin and ifosfamide resulting in response rates of 18-29% in first-line treatment. Combination chemotherapy consisting of anthracyclines and ifosfamide results in Novartis Confidential Page 12 Amended Protocol Version 07  Study No. CRAD001C24114  response rates of 40-50% with up to 10% complete remissions, however at the cost of increased toxicity. Whereas complete remissions lead to prolonged survival, sometimes even cure, overall survival superiority of combination chemotherapy over single-agent doxorubicin has not been established yet. In second-line treatment after anthracycline failure, ifosfamide plays a major role with response rates of up to 30%. Even after pre-treatment with standard doses of ifosfamide, high-dose ifosfamide represents an active treatment option. Based on the understanding of molecular mechanisms and experience from clinical trials, it has become increasingly clear that distinct histological subtypes have a completely different clinical behaviour and response to systemic therapy. Hormonal therapy is very active in low-grade endometrial stromal tumours. Taxanes have shown interesting activity in angiosarcomas, though being inactive in soft tissue sarcoma in general. Topoisomerase I \u2013 inhibitors lead to response rates of 0 to 10% with some additional proportion of disease stabilisation in leiomyosarcomas. Gemcitabine was used in several trials and responses were reported in up to 18% of patients. The combination of Gemcitabine and Docetaxel resulted in a response rate of 53%, predominantly in uterine leiomyosarcomas. This combination was found to be significantly superior to Gemcitabine alone for progression-free survival and overall survival, being the first trial at all, to show superiority in overall survival. There is a wide variety of DNA alternations observed in sarcoma, including translocations, gene amplifications, kinase mutation, gene deletion, loss of p53 and/or Rb and gross chromosomal rearrangements, often define nosological entities (e.g. Ewing sarcoma, synovial sarcoma and GIST). The proteins encoded by these mutated genes differ vary between histological sub-types, ranging from transcription factor. IN recent years, systemic treatment of sarcomas have evolved from a relatively uniform approach (doxorubicin + ifosfamide regiments) towards individualized strategies selecting cytotoxics and targeted treatment for specific histotypes and molecular subtypes (Cassier et al. 2007) ",

                        "Content": " Doxorubicin appears to be the most active drug in the treatment of STS. During the last decade more than a thousand patients have been treated with the drug in connection with several reported studies. The cumulative response rate in non-pre-treated patients is 23%. Activity has also been noted in pre-treated patients in an EORTC trial. Doxorubicin treatment is limited because of cumulative cardiotoxicity, but unfortunately none of the tested anthracycline analogs has shown superiority or comparability to doxorubicin in terms of therapeutic activity with less toxicity. A second active drug in the treatment of STS is ifosfamide. The initial non-randomized studies had shown response rates of 38-67%. The EORTC Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG) performed a randomized phase II trial comparing cyclophosphamide with ifosfamide. In this trial the activity of ifosfamide was confirmed with a 25% response rate in non-pre-treated patients. In a recent study also by the EORTC STBSG, ifosfamide 3g/m2, given over 4 hours on 3 consecutive days showed better activity than ifosfamide 5g/m2 over 24 hours schedule. Novartis Confidential Page 13 Amended Protocol Version 07  Study No. CRAD001C24114  The third drug with known moderate activity is DTIC (Dacarbazine), which achieved a response rate of 17% in 53 patients. Because the response rate of the combination of doxorubicin plus DTIC was much higher as compared with either one of these two drugs alone, DTIC was not studied further as a single agent, until the EORTC STBSG confirmed the activity of the drug in second line. Doxorubicin and ifosfamide have been studied in second line treatment after pre-treatment with the respective other drug. Activity was comparable to first line therapy. After pre-treatment with the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide, there is currently no standard treatment available. Therefore, there is a need to identify other active agents against this disease. ",

The main known functions of mTOR include (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004):  \u2022 mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors, energy and nutrient levels, facilitating cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase in appropriate growth conditions. \u2022 The PI3K (mTOR) pathway itself is frequently deregulated in many human cancers, and oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors. \u2022 The mTOR pathway is involved in the production of pro-angiogenic factors (e.g. VEGF) and inhibits endothelial cell growth and proliferation directly. \u2022 Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases (e.g. p70S6K1), mTOR regulates protein translation. The regulation of mTOR signaling is complex and involves positive regulators, such as AKT that phosphorylate and inactivate negative regulators such as the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC1/TSC2). The pathway is known to be deregulated in numerous proliferate disorders including cancer. Molecular epidemiological studies have also shown that activation of the PI3/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently associated with worsening prognosis through resistance to treatment, disease extension and disease progression. A variety of preclinical models have confirmed the role of this pathway in tumor development. It has also been demonstrated that constitutional activation of kinases such as AKT can lead to inexorable development of cancers resembling those which in patients are characterized by frequent activation of the same kinases. This is complemented by the demonstration of the antitumour activity of kinase inhibitors acting on the pathway in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models. ",

                        "Content": " At the cellular and molecular level RAD001 acts by selectively inhibiting mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Various in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed in order to identify the cell signaling pathways through which RAD001 acts in cancer and identify molecular markers which may predict cellular response. A significant positive correlation was observed between the antiproliferative activity of RAD001 and levels of phosphorylated AKT (Serine 473) and phosphorylated S6 (Serines 240 and 244). Hence, phospho-AKT/phospho-S6 levels may be useful indicators of pathway activation and sensitivity to RAD001. [Investigators\u2019 Brochure, 2006] In vivo studies investigating the antitumour activity of RAD001 against experimental animal tumor models showed that RAD001 monotherapy typically reduced tumor cell growth rates rather than producing regressions or stable disease. These effects occurred within the dose range of 2.5-10mg/kg p.o. daily. The antiangiogenic activity of RAD001 was also confirmed in animal experiments. RAD001 selectively inhibited VEGF-dependent angiogenic response at doses that were well tolerated (see IB 4.1.2.6.), and both primary and metastatic tumors from RAD001-treated mice demonstrated a significant reduction in blood vessel density compared to controls. In humans, studies suggested that 70S6K1 level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) could be a useful pharmacodynamic marker of RAD001 inhibitory effects on the mTOR pathway. Preclinical and clinical studies have been (and are being) conducted to further evaluate which are the best indications and combination partners for RAD001, and which potential molecular markers can predict response to treatment. Based on findings of safety pharmacology studies, the potential of RAD001 to affect vital functions in patients is considered to be low. All significant adverse effects observed in preclinical toxicology studies of RAD001 in mice, rats, monkeys and minipigs were consistent with its anticipated pharmacological action as an antiproliferative and immunosuppressive agent and were at least in part reversible after a 2- or 4-week recovery period, with the exception of the changes in male reproductive organs, most notably testes.

In vitro studies showed that RAD001 is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, P-gp and CYP2D6 substrates, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercised when co-administering RAD001 with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. The elimination half-life is approximately 30 hours.

The most frequent adverse drug reactions in the oncology setting have been rash, stomatitis, fatigue and, to a lesser extent, gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting) and headache. The adverse events are mild-moderate (CTC grade 1-2) in the majority of patients. Severe (grade 3), suspected drug-related, dose-limiting events occurred in 19% of patients, mainly stomatitis (often apthous ulcers), and occasionally severe fatigue, hyperglycemia and neutropenia. Reduced blood counts, hyperlipidemia (mainly hypercholesterolemia) and hyperglycemia are relatively frequent laboratory findings. Infections have not been frequent. The dose and schedule of 10mg p.o. q.d. has been selected for most phase II studies based on assessment of both pharmacodynamic and safety studies. Molecular pharmacodynamic studies using immunohistochemistry assays on tumor biopsies have shown target inhibition at both daily dosage (5-10mg) and weekly dosage (50-70mg) with satisfactory tolerability in most patients. Conventional cytotoxic agents were empirically evaluated in in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies as combination partners for RAD001 and have shown that RAD001 is additive or synergistic in combination with other anticancer agents, including cytotoxics and other signal transduction inhibitors (STIs) as well as endocrine therapy. In many cases, a potentiation of cell death by the drug combination was observed. RAD001 has also been evaluated in several phase I studies in combination with other anticancer drugs. Interactions have required dose reduction of RAD001 when given in combination with some drugs (e.g. Gleevec, Xeloda) but not others (e.g. paclitaxel, letrozole).

                        "Content": " The systemic treatment of locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is unsatisfactory with few drugs showing signs of activity. Treatment is toxic, yet usually given with palliative intent. Novartis Confidential Page 16 Amended Protocol Version 07  Study No. CRAD001C24114  PET responses and improvement of symptoms have been described in sarcoma patients with AP23573, an intravenous mTOR inhibitor () tested in a phase II trial (Sankhala et al., ASCO 2005, abstract 9028). Recent data with this mTOR inhibitor AP23573 demonstrate a single-agent activity in a broad range of sarcoma tumor types in a phase I/II trial. In this trial the patients were enrolled according to their histological subtype of the tumor. Totally, 212 patients were enrolled of which over 90% had a progression at the time of study entry. 79% had 2 prior chemotherapies. The overall clinical benefit rate was 29% and the median OS was 40,1 weeks. In the subset of patients achieving a clinical benefit response, the OS was 67,6 weeks. (Chawla, ASCO 2007, abstract 10076). The experiences with this mTOR inhibitor are a rational to test RAD001 in patients with soft tissue and bone sarcoma. RAD001 is a macrolide, a new derivative of rapamycin. It is orally available and acts as an mTOR inhibitor. TOR is a ubiquitous protein kinase implicated in cell cycle control and specifically in the progression of cells from the G1 to S phase. It is considered to be downstream of PI3-AKT. RAD001 is being developed as an antiproliferative drug with applications as an immunosuppressant and anticancer agent. It is already registered in the transplantation setting as Certican\uf6da. In a phase I study in 33 patients with advanced solid tumors, RAD001 has been given at doses of 20mg, 50mg and 70mg weekly, or 5mg and 10mg daily. Dose limiting toxicities have been stomatitis, neutropenia and hyperglycemia. The recommended dose for further phase II evaluation is 10mg daily (Tabernero et al., ASCO 2005, abstract 3007). ",

If event returns to grade 2, interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade \u2264 1. Then reintroduce RAD001 at the lower dose level. Grade 3 (except hyperlipidemia) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade \u2264 1. Then reintroduce RAD001 at the lower dose level. For pneumonitis, consider the use of a short course of corticosteroids (see table 6.3). Grade 3 hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia) Should be managed using standard medical therapies. Grade 4 Discontinue RAD001.

If a patient requires a dose delay of > 21 days from the intended day of the next \nscheduled dose, then the patient must be discontinued from the study. \nManagement of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers \nStomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to RAD001 should be treated using local \nsupportive care. Please note that investigators in earlier trials have described the oral toxicities \nassociated with RAD001 as mouth ulcers, rather than mucositis or stomatitis. If your \nexamination reveals mouth ulcers rather than a more general inflammation of the mouth, \nplease classify the adverse event as such. Please follow the paradigm below for treatment of \nstomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers: \n1. For \nmild \ntoxicity \n(grade \n1), \nuse \nconservative \nmeasures \nsuch \nas  \nnon-alcoholic mouth wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until \nresolution. \n2. For more severe toxicity (grade 2 in which case patients have pain but are able to maintain \nadequate oral alimentation, or grade 3 in which case patients cannot maintain adequate \noral alimentation), the suggested treatments are topical analgesic mouth treatments (i.e. \nlocal anesthetics, such as benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 26 \nAmended Protocol Version 07 \n \nStudy No. CRAD001C24114 \n \nmenthol, or phenol) with or without topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone oral \npaste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase\u00ae). \n3. Agents containing hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to worsen \nmouth ulcers. It is preferable to avoid these agents. \n4. Antifungal agents must be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In particular, \nsystemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.) \nshould be avoided in all patients due to their strong inhibition of RAD001 metabolism, \nthus leading to higher RAD001 exposures. Therefore, topical antifungal agents are \npreferred if an infection is diagnosed. Similarly, antiviral agents such as acyclovir should \nbe avoided unless a viral infection is diagnosed. \nNote: Stomatitis/oral mucositis should be appropriately graded using the functional grading \ngiven on the NCI-CTC for Adverse Events, version 3.0. \nManagement of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia  \nTreatment of hyperlipidemia should take into account the pre-treatment status and dietary \nhabits. Blood tests to monitor hyperlipidemia must be taken in the fasting state. Grade 2 or \nhigher hypercholesterolemia (> 300mg/dL or 7.75mmol/L) or grade 2 or higher \nhypertriglyceridemia (> 2.5 x ULN) should be treated with a statin or appropriate lipid-\nlowering medication, in addition to diet. Patients should be monitored clinically and through \nserum biochemistry for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse events as \nrequired in the product label/data sheets for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. \nNote: Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is associated \nwith an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested by \nrhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels and myoglobinuria, acute \nrenal failure and sometimes death. The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be \ndetermined for individual patients based on their risk of cardiovascular complications of \nhyperlipidemia. \nGrade 3 hyperglycemia has been observed in patients receiving RAD001 therapy. In many \ncases the affected patients had an abnormal fasting glucose at baseline. Based on this finding, \nit is recommended that optimal glucose control is achieved before starting a patient on \nRAD001. Study patients should have their glucose levels monitored during RAD001 therapy. \nManagement of skin disorders \nIn prior phase I clinical studies with RAD001 alone, rash and/or erythema was the most \nfrequent AE experienced by approximately 40% of patients. For patients with grade 1 \ntoxicity, no specific supportive care is usually needed or indicated. The rash should be \nreported as an AE. Patients with grade 2 supportive toxicity may be treated with supportive \nmeasures, including the following at the discretion of the investigator: oral minocycline, \ntopical tetracycline, topical clindamycin, topical silver sulfadiazine, diphenhydramine, oral \npredinisolone (short course) or pimecrolimus. \nNovartis Confidential Page 27 Amended Protocol Version 07  Study No. CRAD001C24114  Management of gastrointestinal disorders  Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been seen in approximately 15-55% of patients treated with RAD001. The symptoms have in general been mild to moderate (CTC grade 2). Appearance of grade 1-2 diarrhea should lead to supportive care such as loperamide, initiated at the earliest onset (4mg orally followed by 2mg orally every 2 hours until resolution of diarrhea). In patients who have emesis and are unable to retain the medication, every attempt should be made to control symptoms of nausea and vomiting with the best available supportive care. However, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose. Patients experiencing diarrhea leading to hospitalisation will have their drug administration interrupted or changed according to the procedures described in table 6.2. Management of non-infectious pneumonitis Both asymptomatic radiological changes (grade 1) and symptomatic non-infectious pneumonitis (grade 2 = not interfering with activities of daily living or grade 3 = interfering with activities of daily living and oxygen indicated) have been noted in patients receiving RAD001 therapy. Non-infectious pneumonitis has been associated with RAD001 and other mTOR inhibitors. Since disease control for tumor measurement includes bimonthly CT of the lung or chest x-ray, no additional CT/x-ray is required to monitor for asymptomatic (grade 1) non-infectious pneumonitis. Additional chest x-rays or CT scans may be performed when clinically necessary. If non-infectious pneumonitis develops, a consultation with a pulmonologist should be considered. If the patient develops grade 3 pneumonitis, treatment with RAD001 should be interrupted and the patient should be treated as medically indicated (short course corticosteroids, oxygen, etc). Management of non-infectious pneumonitis suspected to be associated with RAD001 and dose modifications instructions are provided in Table 6.3. ",

However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the strong inducer is discontinued the everolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A/PgP inducer. ",

Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow-up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event. Information about all SAE is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form. The investigator must assess the relationship to study drug, complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the completed, signed form by fax within 24 hours to the local Novartis Clinical Safety & Epidemiology Department. The telephone and telefax number of the contact persons in the local department of Clinical Safety and Epidemiology, specific to the site, are listed in the Investigator Folder provided to each site. The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the CRF documentation at the study site. Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow-up to the previously reported SAE and giving the date of the original report. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator\u2019s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Novartis study drug, a Clinical Safety & Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further information from the Investigator for Health Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events, including serious adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry and urine values, regular monitoring of vital signs, physical condition and body weight.

The study is designed to assess the activity, safety, and tolerability of the therapy with RAD001 in progressive bone or soft tissue sarcoma in the three arms each. The data will be analyzed by Novartis and/or by the designated CRO. Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator(s) should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation.

Therefore, enrollment in arm III will be stopped. However, patients already enrolled into arm III will continue to be treated and observed as foreseen by the protocol. The final analysis of arm III will be done when all patients have completed the study or discontinued prematurely.

If the number of responses in arm I is 10 or less, the hypothesis that P is greater than or equal to 40% is rejected with a target type II error rate of 10% and an actual error rate of 9%. If the number of responses in arm II or arm III, respectively, is 8 or more, the hypothesis that P is less than or equal to 20% is rejected with a target type I error rate of 10% and an actual error rate of 8.9%. If the number of responses in arm II is 7 or less, the hypothesis that P is greater than or equal to 40% is rejected with a target type II error of 20% and an actual error rate of 19.2%. The designs were estimated with NCSS Trial and PASS 2002. ",

Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC/REB The protocol and the proposed informed consent form must be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Board (IRB/IEC/REB) before study start. A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by the IRB/IEC/REB must be given to Novartis before study initiation. Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to monitors, auditors, Clinical Quality Assurance representatives, IRBs/IECs/REBs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must inform Novartis immediately that this request has been made. Informed consent  Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written, IRB/IEC/REB-approved informed consent, or, if incapable of doing so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable representative of the patient. In cases where the patient\u2019s representative gives consent, the patient should be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the patient is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by personally signing and dating the written informed consent document or a separate assent form. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures (i.e. all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the patient source documents. Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the investigator must be agreed to by Novartis before submission to the IRB/IEC/REB and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the Novartis monitor after IRB/IEC/REB approval. Amendments to the protocol Any change or addition to the protocol can only be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis, Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC/REB. Only amendments that are required for patient safety may be implemented prior to IRB/IEC/REB approval. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any patient included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, Novartis should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC/REB at the study site should be informed within 10 working days. Study drug supply and resupply, storage, and tracking Study drugs must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designated assistants have access. Upon receipt, all study drugs should be stored according to the instructions specified on the drug labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 51 \nAmended Protocol Version 07 \n \nStudy No. CRAD001C24114 \n \nMedication labels will be in German or in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of \nGermany or the respective country. They will include storage conditions for the drug, but no information about \nthe patient except for the randomization number. \nThe investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study drug in a drug \naccountability ledger. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by the field monitor during site visits \nand at the completion of the trial. Patients must return all unused study drug and packaging at the end of the \nstudy or at the time of study drug discontinuation. \nAt the conclusion of the study and as appropriate during the course of the study, the investigator will return all \nused and unused study drug, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability ledger to \nNovartis. \nNovartis Confidential Page 52 Amended Protocol Version 07  Study No. CRAD001C24114  ",

        "Title": "Post-text supplement 1: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)",
        "Content": " RECIST criteria for evaluation of tumor response Eligibility Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study: \u2022 Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology. \u2022 Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter \u2265 20mm using conventional techniques or \u2265 10mm with spiral CT scan (with minimum lesion size no less than double the slice thickness). \u2022 Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter  < 20mm with conventional techniques or < 10mm with spiral CT scan), i.e. bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions. Methods of tumor measurement The following considerations are to be made when evaluating the tumor: \u2022 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 14 days before the beginning of the treatment. \u2022 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. \u2022 Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment. \u2022 CT and MRI: CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 10mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5-8mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. \u2022 Chest x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. \u2022 Ultrasound: When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination. Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 53 \nAmended Protocol Version 07 \n \nStudy No. CRAD001C24114 \n \n\u2022 Endoscopy and laparoscopy: The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective \ntumor evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific \ncontext require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be \navailable in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor \nresponse should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers. However, such \ntechniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are \nobtained. \n\u2022 Cytology and histology: Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR \nand CR in rare cases (i.e. after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions \nand residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors). Cytologic \nconfirmation of neoplastic nature of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment \nis required when the measurable tumor has met the criteria for response or stable disease. \nUnder such circumstances, the cytologic examination of the fluid collected will permit \ndifferentiation between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the \ntreatment) or progressive disease (if the neoplastic origin of the fluid is confirmed). \n\u2022 Clinical examination: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are \nsuperficial (i.e. skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, \ndocumentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is \nrecommended. \nBaseline documentation of target and non-target lesions \nFor the evaluation of lesions at baseline and throughout the study, the lesions are classified at \nbaseline as either target or non-target lesions: \n\u2022 Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 \nlesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions \nand recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of \ntheir size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated \nmeasurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter \nfor all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of the longest \ndiameter. The baseline sum of the longest diameter will be used as reference by which to \ncharacterize the objective tumor response. \n\u2022 Non-target lesions: All other lesions are considered non-target lesions, i.e. lesions not \nfulfilling the criteria for target lesions at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not \nrequired, but the presence or absence or worsening of each should be noted throughout the \nstudy. \nEvaluation of target and non-target lesions \nTo assess tumor response, the sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be \ncalculated (at baseline and throughout the study). At each assessment response is evaluated \nfirst separately for target (Table 1) and non-target lesions (Table 2). These evaluations are \nthen used to calculate the overall lesion response considering both, the target and non-target \nlesions together (Table 3). \nNovartis Confidential Page 54 Amended Protocol Version 07  Study No. CRAD001C24114  ",

Although a clear progression of \u201cnon target\u201d lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician does prevail and the progression status should be confirmed later on by the review panel (or study chair).

If the evaluation of any of the target or non-target lesions identified at baseline could not be made during follow-up, the overall status must be \u2018unknown\u2019 unless progression was seen. In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the CR. Best overall response The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed not less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. The best overall response for each patient is determined from the sequence of overall (lesion) responses according to the following rules: \u2022 CR = at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart before progression. \u2022 PR = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression (and not qualifying for a CR). \u2022 SD = at least one SD assessment > 6 weeks after start of treatment (and not qualifying for CR or PR). \u2022 PD = progression or death due to underlying cancer \u2264 16 weeks after start of treatment (and not qualifying for CR, PR or SD).
