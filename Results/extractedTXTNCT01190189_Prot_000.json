        "Content": " Detailed Title A phase IIIb, open-label, multi-centre immunization study to evaluate the safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals\u2019 HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine administered intramuscularly according to a 0, 1, 6-month schedule in healthy female subjects who received the placebo control in the GSK HPV-015 study Indication Cervarix is indicated in females from 10 years of age onwards for the prevention of persistent infection, premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer (squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) caused by oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. Rationale for the study and study design Subjects in the HPV-015 study either received the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine or placebo control [Al(OH)3], following a 0, 1, 6-month vaccination schedule. According to the HPV-015 protocol, once the HPV-015 study was concluded, the control placebo group would be offered the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine as well.  As recommended by the study Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), unblinding and cross-over immunization of control recipients with the HPV vaccine will be provided after completion of their end of study activities as follows: \u2022 For subjects who complete study activities after the database is frozen for final analysis, unblinding will occur within 4-6 months after last subject last visit (LSLV) of the final study visit. \u2022 Subjects who will not participate in any of the extensions will be given the option of unblinding before the database is frozen for final analysis upon individual request. The HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine is licensed in the participating countries, but it is not indicated for the age group (26 years and above) involved in the HPV-015 study and this study. Approximately 600 subjects from the control placebo group are expected to enrol in this study. This study is thus being conducted to enable all women, who received the control placebo in the HPV-015 study, to also receive HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine. Safety data in terms of SAEs, medically significant conditions and pregnancy (and their outcomes) will be collected during the study period. Objective(s) \u2022 To assess the safety of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine throughout the study period.

                "Content": " Cervical cancer is the most important manifestation of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women worldwide [Parkin, 2001a; Parkin, 2001b]. Papillomaviruses, members of the papovaviridae family, are non-enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which can cause a variety of proliferative epithelial lesions in humans, including benign papillomas (warts) and invasive cancer [Lowy, 2001; Zur Hausen , 2002].  Currently, over 200 different types of HPVs have been recognized. Based on whether they infect basal epithelial cells of the skin or the inner lining of tissues, they are categorized as cutaneous or mucosal types [Burd, 2003]. At least 30 HPV types have been identified that infect the genital mucosa [Bosch, 1995]. HPV types are also classified by their relative malignant potential into low-risk (LR) types (e.g. HPV-6, -11, -42, -43, and -44) and high-risk (HR) or oncogenic types (e.g. HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -34, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, -66, -68 and -70) [Burd, 2003]. Persistent infection with an oncogenic HPV type has been clearly associated with the development of cervical cancer [Schiffman, 2005] and the association between cervical cancer and infection with a HR HPV type is supported both by strong epidemiological evidence and the detection of HPV DNA in up to 99.7% of cervical cancers worldwide [Schiffman 2005; Burd 2003]. The distribution of HPV types varies within countries and between regions. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the first and second most common types in all regions, with some variation in their distribution. HPV-16 is the most prevalent oncogenic HPV type and is present in approximately 54% of cervical tumor specimens worldwide. HPV-18 is associated with approximately 17% of cervical cancers, with the remaining tumors containing DNA from other oncogenic HPV types such as HPV-45 and -31. In combination, these two HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18) account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases globally [Clifford 2003]. In the general population, the estimated worldwide prevalence of HPV among women is between 5% and 40% [Baseman, 2005; Franco, 1999]. This wide variation reflects underlying population characteristics (i.e. age range, geographic area, risk behaviours), the use of different HPV DNA test methods, and also differences in the sexual activity of the individuals studied. Assuming a conservative prevalence of 10% in developed countries and 15% in developing countries, one author estimated 270 million HPV infections amongst women globally [Bosch, 2002]. ",

                "Content": " GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals has developed a candidate prophylactic HPV vaccine based on L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18 formulated with AS04 (comprised of aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3] and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A [MPL]). The vaccine contains HPV-16 and HPV-18 L1 VLP proteins produced using an CONFIDENTIAL \n \n \n113621 (HPV-067 EXT 015) \n \n \nAmendment 2 \n13-JAN-2011 \n18 \nexpression system based on the use of insect cells and recombinant Baculoviruses \nencoding L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18. The recombinant expressed proteins \nundergo self-assembly to form empty viral capsids referred to as virus-like particles \n(VLPs) [Kirnbauer, 1992]. A study comparing different vaccine formulations \ndemonstrated that the highest antibody titres were induced by AS04-adjuvanted vaccine \nformulations [Giannini, 2006]. The AS04 adjuvant system is comprised of aluminium \nsalts (Al(OH)3) and 3-O-desacyl-4\u2019-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and is also used in \nother vaccines, including a hepatitis B vaccine licensed in Europe for use in \nhaemodialysis patients from the age of 15 years and above under the name Fendrix as \nwell as in an investigational HSV vaccine.  \nTo date, more than 60 000 adolescent and adult females aged 9 years and above have \nreceived at least one dose of the HPV vaccine in clinical studies. A pooled safety analysis \nof data from almost 30 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above, of \nwhom 16 142 received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, showed the vaccine to be \ngenerally well tolerated in women of all ages [Descamps, 2009]. In this publication , \nsubjects from the HPV-015 trial were included and the safety profile in women aged 26 \nand above was similar to the one in 15-25 year olds who received the vaccine. \nResults of a large multinational phase III trial in women aged 15-25 years demonstrated \nhigh vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above \n(CIN2+), CIN1+ and persistent infection (6-month and 12-month definition) associated \nwith HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, significant vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ and CIN3+ \nirrespective of HPV type in the lesion as well as evidence of protection against HPV \ntypes 31, 33 and 45 [Paavonen, 2009]. This study also demonstrated the vaccine to be \ngenerally well tolerated in a broad range of women including those of different \nnationalities and ethnicities [Paavonen, 2007]. \nA long-term efficacy follow-up study in women aged 15-25 years at the time of first \nvaccination demonstrated high vaccine efficacy against incident and persistent HPV-\n16/18 infections and their associated cervical lesions up to 6.4 years of follow-up [Gall, \n2007; Harper, 2004; Harper, 2006; The GlaxoSmithKline Vaccine HPV-007 Study \nGroup, 2009]. \nWhen tested in young female adolescents, the vaccine induced immune responses that \nwere approximately 2-fold higher than those elicited in women 15-25 years of age \n[Pedersen, 2007]. In women up to 55 years of age, the vaccine induced sustained HPV \nantibody levels up to Month 24 after the first vaccine dose and these antibody levels \nremained significantly higher than those seen after natural infection [Schwarz, 2009]. \nThe first major market in which the vaccine under evaluation in this study was licensed is \nAustralia, where licensure was obtained in May 2007 for use in 10 to 45 year old females. \nThe vaccine is marketed under the trade name Cervarix. In September 2007, the vaccine \nwas licensed in the European Union for the prevention of high-grade cervical \nintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN grades 2 and 3) and cervical cancer causally related to \nHPV types 16 and 18. In October 2009, Cervarix has also been approved by the United \nStates Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in females 10 through 25 years \nof age. The vaccine is currently licensed in over 100 countries worldwide. \nCONFIDENTIAL   113621 (HPV-067 EXT 015)   Amendment 2 13-JAN-2011 19 Please refer to the current Investigator Brochure for a review of pre-clinical and clinical studies, and the potential risks and benefits of the candidate prophylactic HPV-16/18 vaccine formulated with AS04.

The nature of each event, date and time (where appropriate) of onset, outcome, intensity and relationship to the HPV vaccine should be entered. Details of any corrective treatment should be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. Refer to Section 6.6.

If these have resolved, the documentation in the eCRF should be completed. When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE on the eCRF or SAE screens as applicable. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject\u2019s medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of the appropriate completed AE/SAE screens in the eCRF.

Therefore, subjects enrolled in HPV-015 extension studies such as study HPV-067 cannot retain the HPV-015 subject number as is stated in the original protocol. Consequently, different identification numbers will be provided by an external statistician. Amended text has been indicated in bold italics and deleted text has been indicated in strikethrough in the following sections: Section 5.2.1. Subject identification Subjects will retain their identification numbers from study HPV-015. A new identification number will be assigned to the subject to preserve the blind for HPV-015 data during this HPV-015 extension study.

A field on the SAE screen allows to specify \nthat the event is a pIMD and whether it is serious or non serious. The SAE screens will \nalways be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event, in \naccordance with the pIMD standard questionnaire provided. Even if the investigator \ndoes not have all information regarding a pIMD, the SAE screens should still be \ncompleted within 24 hours.
