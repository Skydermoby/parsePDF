The hypothesis for OS will be confirmed if the \nupper confidence limit for the hazard ratio (darbepoetin alfa to placebo) is less than 1.15 using a 1-\nsided significance level of 0.025.  \nIf the primary hypothesis is confirmed, the secondary hypothesis that PFS is not worse in subjects \ntreated with darbepoetin alfa than the PFS in subjects treated with placebo will be tested.  The \nhypothesis for PFS will be confirmed if the upper confidence limit for the hazard ratio is less than \n1.15 using a 1-sided significance level of 0.025.\nIf both the OS and PFS hypotheses are confirmed, the hypothesis that the incidence of RBC\ntransfusions is less in subjects treated with darbepoetin alfa than in subjects treated with placebo \nwill be tested.  This hypothesis will be confirmed if the p-value is < 0.05 from a two-sided Cochran-\nMantel-Haenszel test comparing darbepoetin alfa to placebo with respect to the incidence of at least \n1 RBC transfusion or hemoglobin \uf0a38.0 g/dL from day 29 to EOETP.\nIf non-inferiority hypotheses are confirmed for both OS and PFS and the superiority hypothesis is \nconfirmed for the transfusion endpoint, a superiority hypothesis will then be tested for both OS and \nPFS.  These hypotheses will be confirmed by examining the p-values associated with hazard ratios \nfrom both OS and PFS; the Hochberg procedure will adjust for multiplicity and maintain an overall \ntwo-sided significance level of 0.05.\nProduct: darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate:  14 September 2017\nPage 11 of 52\nCONFIDENTIAL\n3.\nStudy Overview\n3.1\nStudy Design\nThis is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in CIA subjects receiving \nmulti-cycle chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced stage NSCLC cancer.  Randomization will \noccur in a 2 to 1 ratio (darbepoetin alfa to placebo) and will be stratified by histology (squamous \nversus other), screening hemoglobin (< 10.0 g/dL versus \u226510.0 g/dL), and geographic region (see \nSection 4.1 for regions).\nSubjects will receive IP Q3W during the treatment period.  IP will be discontinued within 3 weeks \nafter the completion of chemotherapy, or upon the determination of disease progression, whichever \noccurs first. Study visits Q3W and imaging studies Q9W will occur during the treatment period until \ndisease progression. \nAn end of the treatment period visit will occur at the next Q3W visit after disease progression has \nbeen determined. Hemoglobin and other hematology and chemistry values collected beyond \nthis period (ie, beyond 3 weeks after disease progression) will be excluded from analysis.  \nSubjects will then enter long term follow-up and will be followed for survival until death, until \napproximately 2700 deaths have occurred or until early study termination.  \n3.2\nSample Size\nA total of 2700 deaths were planned to be observed in order to exclude a hazard ratio (darbepoetin \nalfa to placebo) of 1.15 with a 1-sided significance level of 0.025.  With 2700 deaths, the study is \npowered at just over 90% if the true hazard ratio is 1.0 (approximately 93%).  To observe 2700 \ndeaths, the study planned to randomize a total of 3000 subjects which assumes a 7-year \nenrollment period, a 3-year follow-up after last subject enrolled, a 1-year survival rate of 51% \n(Sandler et al, 2006), and a common exponential drop-out rate of 0.0511.\nExcluding a hazard ratio of 1.15 corresponds to excluding a decrease in median survival of \napproximately 1.6 months in the darbepoetin alfa arm group compared to placebo.  The estimated \ndecrease in survival has equipoise with the decreased risk of the need for RBC transfusions.  This \nestimation assumes survival time is exponentially distributed which allows for a conversion from a \nhazard ratio to medians (i.e., hazard ratio = medianplacebo/mediandarbepoetin alfa).  A median survival of \n12.3 months (Sandler et al, 2006) was assumed in the placebo arm in order to derive the difference \nin medians that corresponds to a hazard ratio of 1.15.\nThe study was terminated early based on a recommendation by the independent Data \nMonitoring Committee with a sample size of 2549 subjects.

Post-baseline hemoglobin values within 28 days after a RBC \ntransfusion will not be used in the calculation of change.  The last available post-baseline \nhemoglobin, not occurring in the 28 days after a RBC transfusion, will be used to calculate change \nin the event that the EOETP value is missing or occurred in the 28 days after a RBC transfusion.  \nSubjects without a post-baseline value that did not occur in the 28 days after a RBC transfusion and \nsubjects missing a baseline hemoglobin will be excluded from the analysis.  Only central laboratory \nvalues will be used.

Subjects without progression \nwill be censored on the date of their last disease assessment.  Disease progression will be based on \nthe investigator\u2019s assessment of scans using the version of RECIST specified in the protocol at the \ntime of subject enrollment.\nTreatment Group\nSubjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: darbepoetin alfa (500 \u00b5g) Q3W or placebo \nQ3W in a 2:1 allocation.\nTreatment-emergent Adverse Event\nA treatment-emergent adverse event is an adverse reported via the adverse event summary eCRF \nwith an onset date between study day 1 and 30 days after the last dose of IP, inclusive, with one \nexception: VTEs and adverse events associated with RBC transfusions can have an onset date of \n30 days after the last dose of IP or the EOTP visit, whichever is later.\nProduct: darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate:  14 September 2017\nPage 19 of 52\nCONFIDENTIAL\n6.\nAnalysis Sets\n6.1\nPrimary Analysis Set\nThe primary analysis set will include all randomized and consented subjects with non-small \ncell lung cancer who receive at least one dose of investigational product. Subjects will be\nanalyzed according to their randomized treatment group. The analysis of overall survival, \nprogression-free survival, time to progression, response-related endpoints, serious \nAEs, events of interest, VTE and all efficacy endpoints (except for the endpoint of\ntransfusion or hemoglobin \uf0a38.0 g/dL from day 29 to EOETP) will be performed using the\nprimary analysis set.\n6.1.1\nTransfusion from Week 5 to EOETP Primary Analysis Set\nThe transfusion from week 5 to EOETP primary analysis set will include all subjects in the\nprimary analysis set whose EOETP is \u2265day 29. The analysis of the endpoint of transfusion or\nhemoglobin \uf0a38.0 g/dL from day 29 to EOETP will be performed using this primary analysis\nset.\n6.1.2\nFull Analysis Set\nThe full analysis set will include all randomized and consented subjects. Subjects will be analyzed\naccording to their randomized treatment group. A sensitivity analysis of overall survival will be\nperformed using the full analysis set.\n6.1.3\nRadiographic Endpoint Primary Analysis Set\nThe radiographic endpoint primary analysis set will include all randomized and consented\nsubjects who have not had disease progression prior to randomization and who received at \nleast one dose of investigational product. Subjects will be analyzed according to their\nrandomized treatment group.\n6.1.4\nRadiographic Endpoint Full Analysis Set\nThe radiographic endpoint full analysis set will include all randomized and consented subjects\nwho have not had disease progression prior to randomization. Subjects will be analyzed\naccording to their randomized treatment group.  This data set will be used as a sensitivity \nanalysis for progression-free survival.\n6.2\nSafety Analysis Set\nThe safety analysis set will include all randomized and consented subjects who receive at\nleast one dose of investigational product. Subjects will be analyzed according to their actual\ntreatment group.  If a subject is randomized to placebo but receives at least 1 dose of \ndarbepoetin alfa, then that subject will be analyzed as a darbepoetin alfa subject.  If a subject \nProduct: darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate:  14 September 2017\nPage 20 of 52\nCONFIDENTIAL\nis randomized to darbepoetin alfa but only receives placebo, then that subject will be\nanalyzed as a placebo subject.  The safety analysis set will be used to analyze adverse \nevents, VTEs, hematologies, chemistries, dosing, vital signs, and antibody data.\n6.3\nPer Protocol Sets\nSince poor adherence to the protocol could have the potential to bias the results towards a\nconclusion of non-inferiority, a sensitivity analysis will be performed on a per protocol set to\nconfirm results from the primary analysis set. The sensitivity analysis using this per protocol set\nwill be performed for overall survival and progression free survival. The per protocol set will\ninclude subjects in the primary analysis set who meet all of the following additional criteria (also \nsee Appendix A):\n\uf0b7\nhad metastatic (Stage IV) or advanced stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion (prior to \nAmendment 3) NSCLC\n\uf0b7\nno disease progression prior to study day 1\n\uf0b7\nno history of or current cancer diagnosis other than NSCLC\n\uf0b7\nhad baseline pre-chemo scan prior to randomization (for PFS only)\n\uf0b7\nhad an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at screening\n\uf0b7\nhad a life expectancy > 6 months based on the judgment of the investigator at \nscreening\n\uf0b7\ndid not receive erythropoiesis stimulating agents within the 28 days prior to screening\n\uf0b7\ndid not have a documented history of pure red cell aplasia\n\uf0b7\ndosed per protocol through week 7 with the correctly assigned investigational product (this\nincludes receiving planned doses and dose adjustments per section 6.1.2 of the protocol)\n\uf0b7\nreceived first-line cyclic chemotherapy for NSCLC during the treatment period\n\uf0b7\ndid not receive erythropoiesis stimulating agents, other than investigational product as defined in\nthe protocol, during the treatment period.\n6.4\nInterim Analyses Set(s)\nThe interim analyses will be conducted on subjects in primary analysis set who are in the \nclinical trial database at the time of the interim analyses. The interim analysis may include \nsubjects with only partial data (eg, a subject may have only been on study through week 3).\nProduct: darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate:  14 September 2017\nPage 21 of 52\nCONFIDENTIAL\n7.\nPlanned Analyses\n7.1\nInterim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines\nAn Independent Biostatistics Group (IBG) will perform regular safety and interim analyses for an \nindependent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  The DMC will review all available safety data \nregularly; once every 6 months for the first 2 years and once a year thereafter.  In addition, the IBG \nwill conduct 5 formal interim analyses to assess harm (ie, inferiority of darbepoetin alfa relative to \nplacebo) which will occur when approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 60% of the planned total of \n2700 deaths have been observed.  If warranted from these reviews, the DMC may request \nadditional safety data, recommend modifying or stopping the treatment, or recommend suspending \nrandomization.  In addition, the DMC will review enrollment status and assess changes in the \npractice of medicine to make recommendations regarding the ongoing feasibility of the trials.  \nThe IBG and DMC will have access to subjects\u2019 individual treatment assignments.  To minimize the\npotential introduction of bias to the conduct of the study, members of the DMC and will not have any \ndirect contact with study center personnel or subjects.  The DMC will communicate major safety \nconcerns and recommendations regarding study modification or termination based on the safety \nparameters to Amgen in accordance with the DMC charter.\nRecords of all meetings will be approved by the DMC and maintained by the IBG on behalf of the \nDMC Chair for the duration of the study.  Records of all meetings will be transferred and archived in \nthe eTMF (in accordance with SOP-024846) at the conclusion of the study.  Further details are \nprovided in the DMC charter.\n7.2\nPrimary Analysis\nThe primary analysis will be triggered by the study termination date. The planned study termination\ndate will be the date when the 2700th death is reported in the clinical trial database or the study is \notherwise stopped.  The study was terminated early based on an independent Data \nMonitoring Committee recommendation.  The study was closed to further enrollment as of 8 \nMay 2017.  Sites were instructed to enter all outstanding data into the clinical trial database as of 7 \nJune2017, the database will be cleaned, a snapshot will be taken, the database will be locked, and\nthe primary analysis will be performed. Any additional deaths reported during the entry of\noutstanding data which occur on or prior to the termination date will be counted in the primary\nanalysis.  The primary analysis will also serve as the final analysis for this study.\nProduct: darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate:  14 September 2017\nPage 22 of 52\nCONFIDENTIAL\n8.\nData Screening and Acceptance\n8.1\nGeneral Principles\nThe objective of the data screening is to assess the quantity, quality, and statistical characteristics of \nthe data relative to the requirements of the planned analyses.\n8.2\nData Handling and Electronic Transfer of Data\nThe Amgen Global Study Operations-Data Management (GSO-DM) department will provide all data \nto be used in the planned analyses.  This study uses the RAVE database.\n8.3\nHandling of Missing and Incomplete Data\n8.3.1\nMissing Survival Data\nSubjects who did not die on study and are lost to follow-up will be censored on the date last known \nto be alive.\n8.3.2\nMissing Progression Data\nIn order to minimize missing progression data, the study is designed to follow subjects until \ndocumented radiographic disease progression.  If radiographic disease progression is not observed, \nthe primary analysis of progression-free survival and time to progression will censor subjects at \ntheir last on-study disease assessment date.\n8.3.3\nMissing Transfusion Data\nSubjects who withdraw from study prior to day 29 will have missing data for the secondary endpoint, \n\u201cRBC transfusion or hemoglobin \uf0a38.0 g/dL from week 5 (day 29) to EOETP\u201d; these subjects will be \nexcluded from the analysis of this endpoint. \n8.3.4\nMissing Hemoglobin Data\nFor the endpoint \u201cChange in hemoglobin from baseline to EOETP\u201d, the last available post-baseline \nhemoglobin, not occurring in the 28 days after a RBC transfusion, will be used to calculate change \nin the event that the EOETP value is missing or occurred within 28 days after a RBC transfusion.  \nSubjects without a post-baseline value that did not occur in the 28 days after a RBC transfusion and \nsubjects with a missing baseline hemoglobin will be excluded from the analysis of this endpoint.  \n8.3.5\nMissing Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Data\nMissing data for adverse events and concomitant medication will not be imputed.  Adverse event \nand concomitant medication data will be analyzed as observed with the exception of missing dates.  \nMissing or incomplete dates for adverse event or concomitant medication data will be handled \naccording to the following rules in order to estimate when the event occurred/medication was taken \nand the duration:\nProduct: darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate:  14 September 2017\nPage 23 of 52\nCONFIDENTIAL\n8.3.5.1\nImputing Partial or Missing Start Dates\n\uf0b7\nIf the year is unknown, then the date will not be imputed and will be assigned a missing value.\n\uf0b7\nIf the month is unknown, then:\n\uf0b7\nIf the year matches the first dose date, then impute the month and day of the first dose date.\n\uf0b7\nOtherwise, assign January.\n\uf0b7\nIf the day is unknown, then:\n\uf0b7\nIf the month and year match the first dose date, then impute the day of the first dose date.\n\uf0b7\nOtherwise, assign \u201801\u2019.\n8.3.5.2\nImputing Partial or Missing Stop Dates\n\uf0b7\nIf the year is unknown or \u201congoing\u201d is indicated, then the date will not be imputed and will be \nassigned a missing value.\n\uf0b7\nIf the month is unknown, then assign December.\n\uf0b7\nIf the day is unknown, then assign the last day of the month.\nIn no case will the stop date be later than the EOS date\n8.4\nDetection of Bias\nTo check for the introduction of bias, the following analyses will be performed:\n\uf0b7\nComparing the percentage of subjects between treatment groups who withdraw from the \ntreatment prematurely (e.g., withdrawing before completion of chemotherapy or radiographic \ndisease progression)\n\uf0b7\nCalculating the rate of cross-in (subjects randomized to placebo who receive erythropoiesis \nstimulating agents at any point after randomization) in the placebo arm (if applicable)\n\uf0b7\nComparing the percentage of subjects between treatment groups who receive an RBC \ntransfusion when the hemoglobin value at the time of transfusion was \uf0a38.0 g/dL (number of \nsubjects transfused is the denominator)\n\uf0b7\nCross-tabulating the values of the stratification factors recorded in the IVRS versus the case \nreport forms to assess the degree of misspecifications of the stratification factors at \nrandomization.\nProduct: darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate:  14 September 2017\nPage 24 of 52\nCONFIDENTIAL\nAnalyses that examine the impact of these potential sources of bias will be described in the sections \nthat describe the analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints; however, these tables may \nnot be included in the clinical study report.\n8.5\nOutliers\nPotential data outliers will be identified during the analysis dataset programming process and \nqueried as appropriate.  Any data points that are identified as possible outliers, but are subsequently \nverified through the query process, will be treated as valid data and analyzed accordingly.\n8.6\nDistributional Characteristics\nThe statistical assumptions for each method of inferential testing or estimation will be assessed.  If \nthe assumptions for the distributional characteristics of endpoints are not met, these will be \ndescribed and further analyses may be carried out using transformations of endpoint values or \nalternative inferential or estimation methods.  The use of transformations or alternative analysis \nmethods will be fully justified in the final study report.\n8.7\nValidation of Statistical Analyses\nPrograms will be developed and maintained, and output will be verified in accordance with current \nrisk-based quality control procedures.  \nTables, figures, and listings will be produced with validated standard macro programs where \nstandard macros can produce the specified outputs.  \nThe production environment for statistical analyses consists of Amgen-supported versions of \nstatistical analysis software; for example, the SAS System version 9.4 or later or using R.\nProduct: darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate:  14 September 2017\nPage 25 of 52\nCONFIDENTIAL\n9.\nStatistical Methods of Analysis\n9.1\nGeneral Considerations\n\uf0b7\nContinuous variables will be summarized by the mean, standard deviation, median, and\nrange. The confidence interval and standard error for the mean will also be summarized\nfor efficacy variables that are continuous.\n\uf0b7\nCategorical variables will be summarized by the number and percentage in each \ncategory.\n\uf0b7\nTime to event variables will be summarized with hazard ratios, Kaplan-Meier curves, \nKaplan-Meier quartiles, the number of subjects per treatment group, the number of subjects\ncensored, and the number & percent of subjects with events.\n\uf0b7\nFor stratified analyses, the value for the stratification factors will be taken from IVRS rather\nthan the case report forms; a cross-tabulation of the values recorded in the IVRS versus\nthe case report forms will be generated to assess degree of misspecifications of the\nstratification factors at randomization.\n\uf0b7\nTo preserve the overall significance level for the study, statistical testing of the primary and\nsecondary endpoints will follow a hierarchical structure. First, the primary endpoint of OS\nwill be tested. If darbepoetin alfa is demonstrated to be non- inferior to placebo with respect\nto OS, PFS will be formally tested. If darbepoetin alfa is demonstrated to be non-inferior to\nplacebo with respect to PFS then the incidence of RBC transfusions or a hemoglobin \u22648.0\ng/dL will be formally tested. If non- inferiority is demonstrated for both OS and PFS and\nsuperiority is demonstrated for the transfusion endpoint, superiority will then be tested for\nboth OS and PFS using the Hochberg procedure to adjust for multiplicity. For endpoints\nthat are not designated as primary or secondary, statistical testing will be considered\ndescriptive and no adjustments will be made for multiplicity.\n\uf0b7\nWhere confidence intervals are provided, these will be 2-sided at the 95% level, unless otherwise\nspecified\n9.2\nSubject Accountability\nThe number and percentage of subjects screened, randomized, and who received at least one dose \nof investigational product will be presented (a footnote will include the date of first subject \nrandomized and the end of study date).

For subjects randomized to the darbepoetin alfa arm, the\ntime-dependent covariate will be coded \u201c1\u201d throughout the time course (with the \nexception of subjects randomized to darbepoetin alfa who mistakenly receive \nplacebo; they will be coded \u201c0\u201d throughout the time course unless they begin use of \nany erythropoiesis stimulating agent). For subjects randomized to the placebo arm, \nthe time-dependent covariate will initially be coded \u201c0\u201d and change to \u201c1\u201d if and when \nthey begin use of any erythropoiesis stimulating agent. Because the time-dependent \ncovariate is based on information post-randomization, the results of this analysis will \nbe interpreted with caution.\n\uf0b7\nTo assess the impact of misspecifications of the stratification factors at randomization,\na hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval will be estimated from an unstratified Cox\nregression with treatment group as a covariate along with covariates that represent\nthe stratification factors. The values of the stratification factors will be determined\nfrom the case report forms rather than the IVRS.  This analysis will only be done if \nthere is evidence that there were errors in the IVRS stratification factors.\n\uf0b7\nTo assess the impact of the early termination of the study, the primary analysis \nwill be repeated for subjects who were still on-study or in long-term follow-up \n",
