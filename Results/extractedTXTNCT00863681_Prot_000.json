        "Content": "Please see INTRODUCTION of the BAY 12394 (PATENT-1) protocol.In addition, the following aspects should be considered with respect to the long-term extension trial:Based on the currently available scientific evidence, a large proportion of Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH) patients cannot be cured. Therefore, it can be assumed that their disease will progress over the years, requiring a long-term medical treatment to maintain their quality of life and to increase their life expectancy.Although the experiences with BAY 63-2521 with respect to the treatment of PAH are limited, in the light of the severity of the underlying disease it is justified to offer all patients who participated in the PATENT-1 trial a long-term treatment with BAY 63-2521 (until commercially available).In this context, it should be highlighted that BAY 63-2521 revealed a positive benefit-risk ratio in the trials conducted in Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) patients to date (trials # 11874 and # 12166), allowing continuation of the development program. Moreover, in a first interim analysis of the extension phase of trial # 12166 (includes 21 patients with a BAY 63-2521 treatment up to one year) the improvements in walking distance observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment were sustained without any significant safety concerns.For further information refer to the Investigator Brochure. The Investigator\u2019s Brochure will be updated at regular intervals during the conduct of the trial. New versions of the Investigator\u2019s Brochure will be made available to the investigators without delayIntegrated Protocol /Study number BAY 63-2521/12935/Page 7 of 75Final Version 1.0/ 13 Dec 2012/AMD 11",

At each Titration Visit (with the exception of Visit 1) the \ninvestigator needs to decide, based on the patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure, if the \nstudy medication dose should be modified. The respective decision (increase, \nmaintain or decrease dose) must be entered in the IVR-System that will \nautomatically allocate the right dose in accordance with the respective titration \nscheme. Afterwards, the investigator will be informed by the system, which of the \nblinded medication bottles (blinded with respect to the dose) needs to be handed\nover for the next titration period (starts always with the morning dose).\nIndependently from the patient\u2019s allocation to a specific treatment arm in\nPATENT-1, the investigators will apply the following blood pressure based titration \nrules for their dose decision in PATENT-2:\nThe individual study medication dose of the next titration step will be \ndetermined every 2 weeks according to the peripheral SBP measured at trough \nbefore intake of the morning dose under consideration of the following \nalgorithm (= individual dose titration scheme):\n\uf0b7\nIf trough SBP \uf0b395 mmHg, increase dose (+0.5 mg tid).\n\uf0b7\nIf trough SBP 90 - 94 mmHg, maintain dose.\n\uf0b7\nIf trough SBP <90 mmHg without symptoms of hypotension, reduce dose (-\n0.5 mg tid).\n\uf0b7\nIf any SBP <90 mmHg with clinical symptoms of hypotension such as \ndizziness or presyncope, stop study treatment; restart after 24 hours with \nreduced dose (-0.5 mg tid).\nIntegrated Protocol /Study number BAY 63-2521/12935/\nPage 10 of 75\nFinal Version 1.0/ 13 Dec 2012/AMD 11\nIn general, if the investigator requests an increase or decrease of study medication \ndose via the IVR-System, the subsequent dose modification will not exceed \nplus/minus 0.5 mg study medication.\nAlthough the individual dose titration scheme is solely based on the patient\u2019s \nsystolic blood pressure, investigators are obliged to consider in addition the \npatient\u2019s well being. Therefore, it is allowed in case of study medication side \neffects, to suspend a foreseen up-titration step and to maintain the dose.\nTo request an increase of study medication dose is only possible at the planned \nstudy visits Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 4.\nThe Titration Phase ends at day 56 (Visit 5). At this visit the actual dose of the \npatients will be unblinded by the IVR-System.\nPatients from the PATENT-1 Placebo Arm:\nFor patients from the PATENT-1 Placebo Arm the starting dose will be 1 mg \nBAY 63-2521 tid. The individual BAY 63-2521 dose will be titrated every 2 weeks \naccording to the peripheral SBP measured at trough before intake of the next\nmorning dose.

In contrast to the Titration Phase, patients may be \nup-titrated between regular scheduled visits. In this context, investigators have to \nconsider the patient\u2019s blood pressure (refer to the individual dose titration scheme), \npotential BAY 63-2521 side effects and the progression of the underlying\nPulmonary Hypertension.\nSafety Follow Up Phase (30days)\nFor all patients stopping study treatment at any time a Safety Follow Up Visit 30 \ndays after stop of study medication intake should be performed.\nGeneral Note: Stop of study medication and dose reductions for safety reasons (eg \npatient suffers from severe symptomatic hypotension) are allowed at any point in \ntime during the Titration and the Main-Study Phase. In case of intended dose \nreductions the investigator will contact the IVR-System, which can be done \nindependently from any planned study visit, and request a dose reduction (- 0.5 mg \nstudy medication).\n",

However, patients treated with bosentan profited in about the same \nmagnitude in the 6 minute walk test as patients in the therapy na\u00efve cohort did (for \nfurther information refer to the Investigator Brochure, trial 12166).\nThe BAY 63-2521 clearance was increased in smokers compared to non-smokers in \na previous trial in patients with pulmonary hypertension (IMP 12166; see IB for \nmore information). Therefore, patients should report their smoking status to the \ninvestigator.\nDue to the pharmacological mode of action of a guanylate cyclase stimulator, \ntreatment with BAY 63-2521 may unmask existing Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive \ndisease (PVOD), leading to pulmonary congestion and subsequent pulmonary \nedema. Given the severity of the underlying disease this effect may be life-\nthreatening. Clinical symptoms of uncovering of a PVOD may occur weeks to \nmonths after start of treatment with BAY 63-2521. Should signs of pulmonary \nedema occur when BAY 63-2521 is administered, the possibility of associated \nPVOD should be considered and BAY 63-2521\nshould be discontinued \nimmediately.\nThe following undesirable effects of the compound have been observed in clinical \ntrials: decrease in blood pressure (in healthy volunteers mainly diastolic blood \npressure), postural hypotension, dizziness, syncope, increase in heart rate, nasal \ncongestion, feeling hot, headache, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, gastritis, flushing, \nand hyperhidrosis (refer to the Investigator Brochure). Most of the undesirable \nIntegrated Protocol /Study number BAY 63-2521/12935/\nPage 45 of 75\nFinal Version 1.0/ 13 Dec 2012/AMD 11\neffects are caused by the vasodilators mode of action of the drug. The effects of the \ncompound on smooth muscles may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms (eg dilation of \nthe esophageal sphincter with heartburn, esophagitis and dysphagia; diarrhea; \nconstipation).\nIn addition, the possibility of hitherto unforeseen side effects and allergic reactions \nto drugs, which can result in severe damage and even death, must always be \nconsidered.\nAny new, relevant information about adverse drug reactions of BAY 63-2521 will \nbe given to the patients (verbally and in writing).\nInadvertent overdosing with total daily BAY 63-2521 doses of 9 mg (13 and \n32 days), 22.5 mg (14 and 15 days), and 25 mg (2 days) was reported for 5 subjects, \nwhich was tolerated without any adverse events (for further information refer to the \nInvestigator Brochure).\nOverdosage following administration of BAY 63-2521 should be treated as \nclinically indicated. There is no known antidote to BAY 63-2521.\nDue to the pharmacological profile of BAY 63-2521, cardiovascular effects as \ndescribed in the Investigator Brochure (Section 5.3.3.3) may be expected in case of \noverdose.\nIf symptoms develop after the investigational drug has been administered, any \ntherapy that becomes necessary has to be guided by the predominant symptoms. \nPatients have to remain under medical supervision until all relevant adverse effects \nhave subsided. If adverse events occur, the investigator has to decide whether or not \nto remove the patient from the trial (refer to Section 4.3). Emergency drugs and \nequipment has to be available to provide any treatment, which may become \nnecessary.\nIn case of overdose, general measures to prevent absorption (eg, gastric lavage, \nactivated charcoal) should to be taken.\n",

Blood pressure monitoring and heart rate are the main hemodynamic safety \nparameters that need to be considered.\ncA Termination Visit will only be performed in case of premature stop of study medication or if the sponsor announces the official end of the \nstudy. In such case, generally the same measurements and procedures should be performed as at Main-Study Visits (V7 \u2013 Vn). In particular, \nevery effort should be made to perform the 6MWD Test. Deviations, particularly from the scheduled points in time need to be documented in \nthe electronic CRF.\ndDuring the Titration Phase these test have to be performed by a second person (for WHO functional class assessment a second physician) \nwho is not involved in the process of study drug titration and is unaware of the immediate reaction of the patient\u2019s blood pressure and heart \nrate after dosing.
