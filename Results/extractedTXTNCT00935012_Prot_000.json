INTRODUCTION\n1.1. Indication\nTafamidis is being developed for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, specifically \ntargeting ATTR polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy.  This protocol will be specific for the \nATTR cardiomyopathy (TTR-CM) indication.\n1.2. Background and Rationale\nTransthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a disease induced by accumulation of insoluble fibrillar \nprotein as amyloid in the tissues in amounts sufficient to impair normal function.  The major \nphenotypic presentations are a sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy (ATTR with \npolyneuropathy, or TTR-FAP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (ATTR with cardiomyopathy, \nor TTR-CM). Transthyretin, a 127-amino acid, 55 kDa protein, primarily synthesized in the \nliver, is a secreted protein present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and is a carrier of \nthyroxine and retinol-binding protein-retinol (vitamin A) complex [1, 2]. In its native state, \nTTR exists as a homotetramer with two C2 symmetric funnel-shaped thyroxine binding sites \nlocated at the central dimer-dimer interface [3, 4, 5].\nNatural amino acid sequence (wild-type) TTR and mutated variants of TTR can be involved \nin amyloid disease. However, mutated TTR species are more prone to accelerated \nfibrillogenesis, the most important risk factor for TTR amyloidosis [1, 2]. There are more \nthan 80 TTR point mutations that have been associated with TTR amyloidosis [6]. All \ndisease-associated mutations characterized thus far destabilize the TTR tetramer and many \ninfluence the velocity of rate-limiting tetramer dissociation [7]. An amyloidogenic mutation \nor aging can lead to tetramer dissociation into an alternatively folded monomeric \namyloidogenic intermediate. This intermediate self-assembles into profilaments, filaments, \nand, under certain conditions, amyloid fibrils [8, 9]. In fact, the rate determining step for \nTTR amyloid formation is tetramer dissociation [10].\nCardiac involvement in ATTR, also known as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy when \nassociated with variant TTR, or senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) when associated with \nwild-type TTR, is associated with amyloid fibril infiltration of the myocardium, leading to \ndiastolic dysfunction progressing to restrictive cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure \n[3]. ATTR-CM is a late-onset disease with symptoms typically occurring in patients over \n60 years of age. Although there are approximately 24 mutations associated with specific \ncardiac involvement, one common mutation, V122I (substitution of isoleucine for valine at \nposition 122), has been reported with high frequency (prevalence of 3.4% to 3.9% [2]) in \nAfrican-Americans. In an autopsy series, African Americans older than 60 years of age were \nfound to be at greater risk of TTR amyloid cardiac deposits compared with Caucasians or \nHispanics (1.6% vs. 0.4 and 0.13 respectively) [11]. In addition, 23% of the African \nAmerican patients with TTR cardiac amyloidosis with evaluable DNA samples were \nheterozygous with the V122I mutation. Finally, all patients found to be V122I heterozygous \nhad evidence of TTR cardiac amyloid on autopsy. These data confirm the association of the \nV122I TTR mutation with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy and suggest a high clinical \npenetrance [11].\nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 17\nA mutation in TTR is not a pre-requisite for developing ATTR-CM. In the elderly, wild-type \n(normal) TTR may become structurally unstable resulting in deposition of amyloid fibrils \nprimarily in heart tissue and leading to diastolic dysfunction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and \ncongestive heart failure [4, 5, 6, 7]. The frequency of TTR amyloid deposition in cardiac \nventricles reported from autopsy studies in patients >80 years of age range from 1.8% [12] to \n16.5% [13], with a rate of clinical cardiac disease pre-mortem of 34% [13].\nFor both wild-type and variant ATTR-CM, TTR amyloid fibrils are deposited in the \nmyocardial interstitium, causing an increase in ventricular wall thickness, inducing \nmyocardial damage and affecting myocardial function. Clinical symptoms include dyspnea \non exertion, shortness of breath, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and atrial fibrillation. \nElectrocardiogram findings demonstrate low voltage [14], particularly in light of the \nmarkedly thickened ventricular walls (median wall thickness of 17 mm [14]) demonstrated \nby echocardiogram. Amino-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP), a serum \nmarker of cardiac wall stress, is elevated in this population [15].\nCurrent treatment is symptomatic, with careful fluid management and management of \narrhythmias the mainstay. Median survival is approximately 60 months [14, 15], with \n42% of patients dying from a cardiac cause [16]. Combined heart and liver transplantation is \na current treatment option, however limited organ availability and significant patient co-\nmorbidity limit transplant as a treatment option.\nThe natural history of TTR-CM was studied in the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiac Study \n(TRACS), in a cohort of patients followed longitudinally for 24 months. Using a variety of \ncardiovascular monitoring examinations (e.g., electrocardiograms [ECG], echocardiography, \ncardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], exercise tolerance testing), the study evaluated \nhow the disease affects patients over time. This information will be utilized in two ways: \n(1) to better define the natural course of the disease; and (2) more importantly, to better \nunderstand how to measure the effectiveness of future treatments by identifying endpoints \nthat are well-correlated with disease progression/regression and to support the selection of \nendpoints to be used in clinical trials.\nData on 29 patients (mean age 74 years) have been analyzed (18 wild-type and 11 V122I). \nMost patients are male (92%) and are New York Heart Association (NYHA) \nClassification I or II with significant cardiac symptoms reported at baseline. After an \naverage follow-up time of 16 months, 11 patients died and one patient underwent cardiac \ntransplant, giving the proportion of death/cardiac death of 41%, and a death rate per patient \nmonth exposure of 0.03. In addition, 41% of the patients experienced a cardiac \nhospitalization at least once, and 55% of the patients died or had a cardiac hospitalization. \nPreliminary analysis of cardiac assessments demonstrate significantly elevated NT-Pro-BNP \nand troponin levels, abnormal functional status as assessed by the 6-minute walk test, and \nsignificant diastolic dysfunction and thickened ventricles as assessed by echocardiography \nand cardiac MRI.\nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 18\n1.2.1. Tafamidis for the Treatment of TTR\nPfizer Inc is currently investigating tafamidis for the treatment of TTR-CM. Tafamidis\nmeglumine [d-glucitol, 1-deoxy-1-(methylamino)-, 2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-6-\nbenzoxazolecarboxylate (1:1)] is the meglumine salt form of \n2-(3,5-dichloro-phenyl)-benzoxazole-6-carboxylic acid and is a novel, small molecule \nstabilizer of transthyretin. Specifically, tafamidis exhibits negative cooperative binding (i.e., \ndissociation constants of 2 nM [Kd1] and 154 nM [Kd2], respectively) to the two thyroxine \nbinding sites on the native tetrameric form of TTR and thereby prevents its dissociation into \nmonomers. At low pH, fibril formation of wild-type TTR and the most prevalent \namyloidogenic variants, V30M and V122I, is potently inhibited by tafamidis. No fibril \nformation is observed for wild-type, V30M, and V122I variants at a 2:1 tafamidis:TTR \nstoichiometry. Under urea denaturating conditions, only 33% of TTR tetramer dissociates \nafter incubation for 72 hours with equimolar quantity of tafamidis, when negligible tetramer \ndissociation is observed at a 2:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry. Based on these data, it \nappears that a 1:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry should be sufficient to stabilize TTR. The \nnormal range of TTR level is between 18 and 38 mg/dL, corresponding to 3.2 to 6.8 \uf06dM of \nTTR. Therefore, plasma levels of 3.6 to 7.2 \uf06dM (~1-2 \uf06dg/mL) of tafamidis should stabilize \nTTR levels at least to the upper limit of the normal range.\nIn vitro addition of tafamidis to human plasma stabilizes wild-type, V30M, and V122I \ntetrameric TTR under strong urea denaturing conditions for at least four days. Under these \nsame conditions most of the TTR is denatured in two days in the absence of stabilizer. \nStabilization is observed at tafamidis concentrations between 3.6 and 7.2 \uf06dM for TTR plasma \nlevels ranging from low (15.5 mg/dL [2.8 \uf06dM]) to high (28 mg/dL [5 \uf06dM]), confirming the \neffective therapeutic plasma level range between 3.6 and 7.2 \uf06dM (corresponding to \n~1-2 \uf06dg/mL concentration of tafamidis in plasma). Ex-vivo results with plasma samples \nfrom initial Phase 1 clinical testing confirm this hypothesis and indicate that drug plasma \nlevels between 0.7 to 1.7 \uf06dg/mL stabilize plasma TTR (when TTR plasma levels are between \n16 and 36 mg/dL) after once a day dosing with tafamidis. Based on Phase 1 results, this drug \nlevel range would be achieved at steady-state after once-daily 20 mg (soft gelatin capsule), \nthe tafamidis dose chosen for clinical evaluation.\n1.2.2. Study Rationale\nThe initial development activities for tafamidis were undertaken in patients with TTR-FAP.\nSafety data in this population, and the results from the TRACS study, led to the initiation of \nProtocol Fx1B-201, a 12-month trial of tafamidis in patients with TTR-CM. The results of \nthe Fx1B-201 study will be used in the design of a Phase 3 program that will evaluate the \nefficacy and safety of tafamidis in TTR-CM.\nTTR-CM is a slowly progressing disease with a median survival of approximately 60 months \n[14, 15].  It is currently not known whether tafamidis will be effective in slowing or halting \nthe progression of TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy, or when such an impact would become \nevident. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to assess the long-term safety and \nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 19\nefficacy of tafamidis in patients with ATTR-CM. Eligible patients who successfully \ncompleted Protocol Fx1B-201, having received open-label tafamidis for 12 months, may \nenroll in Protocol Fx1B-303 and continue to receive open-label tafamidis for up to an \nadditional 10 years.\n1.2.3. Non-Clinical Experience with Tafamidis\nNonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and \nexcretion; ADME), and toxicology studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo in the mouse, \nrat, rabbit, and dog have been completed.  In vitro nonclinical studies have confirmed that the \npharmacological activity of tafamidis is consistent with its high affinity binding to the two \nthyroxine binding sites of TTR in a non-cooperative manner and the resulting stabilization of \nTTR (wild type and amyloidogenic variants) by preventing dissociation of tetramers into \nmonomers.\nThe general safety pharmacology profile of tafamidis demonstrated minimal nonselective \nbinding to enzymes or ion channels, with no potential for anti-inflammatory activity.  \nTafamidis had minimal effects on either the central nervous system or cardiopulmonary\nphysiology parameters in dogs. Tafamidis did not demonstrate the potential for QT \nprolongation. QTc shortening, observed at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg, was associated with \ntotal plasma concentrations that exceeded 90 \u00b5g/mL. However, mean human steady-state \nmaximum concentration (Cmax) values following the daily therapeutic dose of 20 mg in \nelderly and nonelderly subjects were 2.8 and 2.3 \u00b5g/mL respectively. Given the 30 to \n40-fold difference in exposures, it is felt that the nonclinical observations have little \nrelevance to the clinical profile of tafamidis.\nPredictable pharmacokinetic behavior of tafamidis was demonstrated following oral \nadministration in the nonclinical species. Tafamidis was absorbed following oral \nadministration with an absolute bioavailability >90% and exhibited dose proportional \nincreases in Cmax and AUC at dose up to 30 mg/kg, but further increases in the administered \ndose provided less than proportional increases in systemic exposure, indicating saturation in \nthe drug absorption. Terminal plasma half life is about 40 hours following a single \nadministration. Drug accumulation has been confirmed in repeated dose studies.\nTafamidis is readily absorbed through the intestinal wall upon administration and is bound to \na high extent to plasma proteins (>97%), essentially TTR and albumin. Tafamidis distributes \nwidely in tissues (maternal and fetal), crosses the placental barrier to an extent of less than \n5% of the initial dose, and ~ 30% of the dam\u2019s dose transferred into the milk.\nTafamidis demonstrated a high degree of metabolic stability and its limited biotransformation \nresulted in the formation of a monoglucuronide (acylglucuronide) as the primary metabolite \nin most of the nonclinical species and humans, while a monooxidative product was only \ndetected in the mouse and rabbit.  In rats, tafamidis is cleared primarily via biliary excretion \nand fecal elimination with some enterohepatic circulation, with a smaller contribution by the \nurine.  A human ADME study suggests similar pathways are operative in humans.\nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 20\nTafamidis meglumine has been evaluated in vitro to assess protein binding, induction and \ninhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5), and \ninhibition of transporter protein P glycoprotein (P gp), with results suggesting very low \nlikelihood for clinical drug-drug interactions.  No significant CYP 450 inhibition was \nobserved.  A series of nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs to \nassess the safety of tafamidis. The absence of acute toxicity following a single dose of \ntafamidis up to 600 mg/kg in dogs is indicative of a low risk for overdose.  Tafamidis was \nwell tolerated following repeated daily oral administration up to 26 weeks in rats and \n39 weeks in dogs. The NOAEL was determined to be 30 mg/kg/day in the rat and \n45 mg/kg/day in dog. When doses were increased above the NOAELs, rodents had a drug \naccumulation in their stomachs while dogs vomited. Other signs of toxicity accompanied \nthese obvious signs, including decreased food intake, modified feces, stress related signs, \nincrease in liver weight and in liver enzyme levels, lymphoid depletion, and kidney lesions in \nrodents. \nTafamidis was nongenotoxic in a battery of in vitro studies, although a slight increase in \nfrequency of polyploid cells was observed at 100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL in the presence of \nS9 activation but not without metabolic activation in the in vitro chromosome aberration \nassay using human peripheral lymphocytes. Polyploidy is not considered to be a reliable \nsurrogate marker for aneugenicity.  The lack of risk for aneuploidy induction with tafamidis \nwas further evidenced by the lack of micronucleus induction in the bone marrow of \nSprague-Dawley rats at the doses producing Cmax and AUC values significantly exceeding \nthe predicted clinical exposures (~ 72X over the Cmax and ~ 67X over the steady state \nAUC(0-24) observed in humans, based on exposure in a 4-week rat study). The evaluation of \nthe carcinogenic potential in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice did not demonstrate an increase in \nthe incidence of neoplasia.\nTafamidis did not demonstrate any effects on fertility, general reproductive performance and \nearly embryo-fetal development in the rat and the maternal and paternal NOEL for \nreproductive toxicity was determined to be greater than 30 mg/kg/day. Developmental \ntoxicity was evident in the rat by reduced fetal weights in the 30 and 45 mg/kg/day maternal \ndosage groups (developmental NOAEL = 15 mg/kg). Developmental toxicity in the rabbit \nwas demonstrated by increased post-implantation loss, reduced fetal body weight and \nassociated skeletal variations, and malformation at 8 mg/kg and skeletal variations at \n2 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for developmental toxicity in rabbits was 0.5 mg/kg/day.\nTafamidis-related toxicity in the developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproduction toxicity \nstudy in rats resulted in a NOAEL for reproductive toxicity and for viability and growth of \nthe F1 generation of 5 mg/kg/day. Women of child-bearing potential should take measures \nto prevent pregnancy while being treated with tafamidis.\nNon-clinical data indicate that there is a large safety margin above the anticipated human \nefficacious plasma concentration and those concentrations associated with toxicity in rats or \ndogs. Emesis was the most common form of clinical intolerance in the dog. Owing to the \ndosing strategy, the immediate emetic activity led to apparent aspiration of gastric contents \nand/or drug, leading to moribundity and subsequent euthanasia. The gastric impaction and \nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 21\nsubsequent delayed gastric emptying, presumably followed by circulatory distress, shock and \nmultiorgan failure, in rats was caused by a supraclinical dosing regimen and is not a relevant \nrisk to human subjects. While the exact mechanism(s) for the toxicities observed following \nthe oral administration of tafamidis has not been elucidated, there is an ample therapeutic \nmargin to permit safe exposure to humans and there was no toxicity identified that would \npreclude human use, such as undetectable lesions or irreversible damage.\nNo target organs of tafamidis-related toxicity were identified in the repeated dose toxicity \nstudies conducted in rats or dogs (26 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively). However, in the \nCByB6F1 hybrid mouse and the tg.rasH2 mouse, the liver and/or kidney have been identified \nas target organs as non-neoplastic lesions were noted following treatment for 28 days \n(CByB6F1 hybrid mouse) or 26 weeks (tg.rasH2 mouse). Nephrosis was the primary lesion \nnoted in the kidneys, only in male mice and in a dose-dependent manner. In the liver, \ncentrilobular hypertrophy and scattered single cell necrosis were present in male mice more \nthan in the female mice in terms of the incidence of both lesions and the severity of the \ncentrilobular hypertrophy. The incidence of both liver lesions was dose dependent.\nHowever, the mouse (CByB6F1) did not demonstrate a unique monooxide metabolite that \nwas not present in the rat or dog, nor has it been detected in the plasma of humans \nadministered tafamidis.  However, a causal relationship between the monoxide metabolite \nand the liver and/or kidney lesions has not been established.\nGenerally, there were no significant toxicities observed in the repeated dose toxicology \nstudies in the rat and dog. Therefore, tafamidis was considered to be well tolerated in the rat \nat dose levels up to 30 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks, providing an exposure ratio of 45- to 63-fold \nbased on the human AUC at steady state, and in the dog at dose levels up to 45 mg/kg/day for \n39 weeks providing an exposure ratio of 29- to 36-fold based on the human AUC at steady \nstate.  Additionally, there was no evidence for an increased risk of neoplasia at exposures at \nleast 31-fold the human AUC nor was there evidence of any tafamidis-related genotoxicity.\nWith the exception of the reproductive developmental toxicity findings, tafamidis has an \nexcellent nonclinical safety profile.\nRefer to the Tafamidis Investigator Brochure for further details.\n1.2.4. Tafamidis Clinical Experience\nThe clinical development program for tafamidis has included 13 controlled and uncontrolled \nclinical trials and two non-interventional, observational studies completed primarily in \npatients with TTR-FAP.  As of 13 May 2011, patients with TTR-FAP (n=127) received \n20 mg of tafamidis administered daily for an average of 538 days (range of 15 to 994 days) \nor approximately 187 patient-years. The mean duration of exposure was 17.7 months: \n87 were treated for at least 1 year, 43 were treated for at least 2 years, and 31 were treated for \nat least 30-<36 months.  \nThe tafamidis 20 mg soft gelatin capsule (as used in the clinical studies) demonstrated a \nhalf-life average of 59 hours and Cavg(SS) average of 2.07 \u03bcg/mL (SD=0.20). The tafamidis \n20-mg soft gelatin capsule daily dose resulted in an average fluctuation (peak to trough) of \nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 22\n51.8%, with an average minimum concentration (Cmin) of 1.61 \u03bcg/mL and an average Cmax of \n2.66 \u03bcg/mL. The average range was consistent with the 1 to 2 \u00b5g/mL required to stabilize \nTTR levels beyond the upper limit of the normal range; steady state was attained within \n12 days, and exposure was consistent across subjects, with low variability across subjects for \nkey PK parameters.  Note that steady-state exposure was similar between males and females.  \nTherefore, the 20 mg daily dose has been used in the development program.  Further, based \non a population PK analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly or patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment. \nThe primary purpose of a therapy such as tafamidis is to stabilize the TTR tetramer, thus \ninhibiting the amyloid cascade and ultimately halting or slowing TTR-FAP disease \nprogression over a sustained period of time.  During the 18-month period of intervention in \nStudy Fx-005, tafamidis slowed the course of neurological impairment and maintained \nquality of life in treated patients. Together, with the extension Study Fx-006 data, tafamidis \ndemonstrated a sustained effect over 30 months, a period of time representing approximately \n25% of the average TTR-FAPPN disease duration of 10 years. Further, Study Fx1A-201 was \na small Phase 2II open label, single-treatment arm study designed primarily to determine the \nefficacy of tafamidis in stabilizing TTR variants other than the V30M (valine replaced by \nmethionine at position 30) mutation. The results from this study of non-V30M TTR-FAP\npatients, which represented an older, more severely affected patient population, strongly \nsupported the observed efficacy of tafamidis in V30M patients.  As in Study Fx-005, the \nconsistency of response across endpoints measuring different aspects of this multi-faceted \ndisease was again observed following 12 months treatment with tafamidis.  The results \nindicated the disease-modifying utility of tafamidis in treating all patients with TTR-FAPPN, \nregardless of mutation. \nStudy Fx1B-201 was a small Phase 2 study in TTR-CM in which a total of 35 patients were \nenrolled and analyzed, 31 patients with wild-type genotype and 4 with V122I genotype.  As \nexpected, the patients were elderly (mean age approximately 76 years), with significant \ndisease duration (approximately 8 years) and signs and symptoms of mild to moderate \ncardiac dysfunction (84% with NYHA Class I or II) at the time of enrollment.\nTafamidis effectively stabilized TTR in 34 of 35 (97.1%) patients, representing both \nwild-type and V122I, at Week 6, with approximately 88% stabilized throughout the \n12 months.\nFollowing 12 months treatment with tafamidis, along with routine standard of care, \n2/35 (5.7%) patients died, 9/35 (25.7%) experienced at least one cardiovascular \nhospitalization, and 9/35 (25.7%) experienced the composite endpoint of death or \ncardiovascular hospitalization.  Results were similar between the TTR genotype groups.  \nThese data were numerically better than that reported in the TRACS historical control cohort, \nduring which the 12-month rate of death, cardiovascular hospitalizations and \ndeath/cardiovascular hospitalizations were 6/29 (20.7%), 10/29 (34.5%) and 13/29 (44.8%), \nrespectively.\nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 23\nCardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin I and T) at baseline were elevated, which was not \nunexpected given the patients\u2019 underlying cardiac involvement.  The change in NT-proBNP \nover 12 months was relatively small, and numerically lower than that observed in TRACS.  \nTroponin I and T, more specific markers of cardiac necrosis, remained stable, suggesting no \nsubstantial deterioration of cardiac status over 12 months of tafamidis treatment.  These data \nare supported by the functional assessments of NYHA classification and 6MWT.  At \n12 months, 75% of the patients had improved or preserved NYHA classification, with the \noverall population demonstrating minimal change in distance walked (-11 meters).  This \nmaintained functional walking capacity is in contrast to the deterioration observed in TRACS \nat 12 months (-44 meters).\nNon-invasive cardiac assessments demonstrated significant cardiac involvement at baseline, \nwith substantial ventricular wall thickening (echocardiography and cardiac MRI) and \nelevated intra-cardiac filling pressures (echocardiography).  There were no consistent \nclinically relevant changes in these parameters over time (echocardiography).  For the \nwild-type patients (the majority of patients in the study), the deterioration in ejection fraction \n(-3.9) and stroke volume (-8.0) observed in the current study was less than that observed in \nTRACS (-10.5 and -15.4, respectively) at 12 months.  Similar findings were observed in a \nsubset of patients that underwent cardiac MRI.  An additional finding in cardiac MRI was a \ndecrease in percent of left ventricle (LV) mass with amyloid observed at 12 months in the \nsmall subgroup of patients undergoing this assessment, while there was an increase in LV \nmass with amyloid observed in TRACS. \nBaseline electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring demonstrated substantial \nconduction and rhythm abnormalities, including bundle branch blocks and atrial \nfibrillation/flutter.  There were no clinically relevant changes over time in these assessments, \nwith perhaps slight improvement in cardiac autonomic function as demonstrated by improved \nheart rate variability indices.\nOver the 12 months of tafamidis treatment, the patients\u2019 quality of life was maintained as was \ntheir functional status, as assessed by the SF-36, and KCCQ and PGA, respectively. The \nmajority of these results were also better when compared with TRACS. \nSeven patients participated in both TRACS (median follow up 12.5 months, with range of \n6-26 months) and in Study Fx1B-201. All seven patients completed 12 months of treatment \nwith tafamidis. However, given the small number of patients, it is difficult to assess whether \ndisease progression was different during treatment with tafamidis as compared to standard of \ncare in TRACS.  The rate of cardiovascular hospitalization was similar between the two \n12-month periods, with some evidence of stabilized cardiac function (ejection fraction and \nfractional shortening) observed following treatment with tafamidis. \nOverall, tafamidis was effective in achieving and maintaining TTR stabilization in both \nwild-type and V122I patients and showed an apparent stabilization of the progression of \ncardiac disease.\n",

                "Content": "Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a disease induced by accumulation of insoluble fibrillar protein as amyloid in the tissues in amounts sufficient to impair normal function.  The major phenotypic presentations are a sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy (ATTR with polyneuropathy, or TTR-FAP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (ATTR with cardiomyopathy, or TTR-CM). Transthyretin, a 127-amino acid, 55 kDa protein, primarily synthesized in the liver, is a secreted protein present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and is a carrier of thyroxine and retinol-binding protein-retinol (vitamin A) complex [1, 2]. In its native state, TTR exists as a homotetramer with two C2 symmetric funnel-shaped thyroxine binding sites located at the central dimer-dimer interface [3, 4, 5].Natural amino acid sequence (wild-type) TTR and mutated variants of TTR can be involved in amyloid disease. However, mutated TTR species are more prone to accelerated fibrillogenesis, the most important risk factor for TTR amyloidosis [1, 2]. There are more than 80 TTR point mutations that have been associated with TTR amyloidosis [6]. All disease-associated mutations characterized thus far destabilize the TTR tetramer and many influence the velocity of rate-limiting tetramer dissociation [7]. An amyloidogenic mutation or aging can lead to tetramer dissociation into an alternatively folded monomeric amyloidogenic intermediate. This intermediate self-assembles into profilaments, filaments, and, under certain conditions, amyloid fibrils [8, 9]. In fact, the rate determining step for TTR amyloid formation is tetramer dissociation [10].Cardiac involvement in ATTR, also known as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy when associated with variant TTR, or senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) when associated with wild-type TTR, is associated with amyloid fibril infiltration of the myocardium, leading to diastolic dysfunction progressing to restrictive cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure [3]. ATTR-CM is a late-onset disease with symptoms typically occurring in patients over 60 years of age. Although there are approximately 24 mutations associated with specific cardiac involvement, one common mutation, V122I (substitution of isoleucine for valine at position 122), has been reported with high frequency (prevalence of 3.4% to 3.9% [2]) in African-Americans. In an autopsy series, African Americans older than 60 years of age were found to be at greater risk of TTR amyloid cardiac deposits compared with Caucasians or Hispanics (1.6% vs. 0.4 and 0.13 respectively) [11]. In addition, 23% of the African American patients with TTR cardiac amyloidosis with evaluable DNA samples were heterozygous with the V122I mutation. Finally, all patients found to be V122I heterozygous had evidence of TTR cardiac amyloid on autopsy. These data confirm the association of the V122I TTR mutation with TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy and suggest a high clinical penetrance [11].Tafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 17\nA mutation in TTR is not a pre-requisite for developing ATTR-CM. In the elderly, wild-type \n(normal) TTR may become structurally unstable resulting in deposition of amyloid fibrils \nprimarily in heart tissue and leading to diastolic dysfunction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and \ncongestive heart failure [4, 5, 6, 7]. The frequency of TTR amyloid deposition in cardiac \nventricles reported from autopsy studies in patients >80 years of age range from 1.8% [12] to \n16.5% [13], with a rate of clinical cardiac disease pre-mortem of 34% [13].\nFor both wild-type and variant ATTR-CM, TTR amyloid fibrils are deposited in the \nmyocardial interstitium, causing an increase in ventricular wall thickness, inducing \nmyocardial damage and affecting myocardial function. Clinical symptoms include dyspnea \non exertion, shortness of breath, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and atrial fibrillation. \nElectrocardiogram findings demonstrate low voltage [14], particularly in light of the \nmarkedly thickened ventricular walls (median wall thickness of 17 mm [14]) demonstrated \nby echocardiogram. Amino-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP), a serum \nmarker of cardiac wall stress, is elevated in this population [15].\nCurrent treatment is symptomatic, with careful fluid management and management of \narrhythmias the mainstay. Median survival is approximately 60 months [14, 15], with \n42% of patients dying from a cardiac cause [16]. Combined heart and liver transplantation is \na current treatment option, however limited organ availability and significant patient co-\nmorbidity limit transplant as a treatment option.\nThe natural history of TTR-CM was studied in the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiac Study \n(TRACS), in a cohort of patients followed longitudinally for 24 months. Using a variety of \ncardiovascular monitoring examinations (e.g., electrocardiograms [ECG], echocardiography, \ncardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], exercise tolerance testing), the study evaluated \nhow the disease affects patients over time. This information will be utilized in two ways: \n(1) to better define the natural course of the disease; and (2) more importantly, to better \nunderstand how to measure the effectiveness of future treatments by identifying endpoints \nthat are well-correlated with disease progression/regression and to support the selection of \nendpoints to be used in clinical trials.\nData on 29 patients (mean age 74 years) have been analyzed (18 wild-type and 11 V122I). \nMost patients are male (92%) and are New York Heart Association (NYHA) \nClassification I or II with significant cardiac symptoms reported at baseline. After an \naverage follow-up time of 16 months, 11 patients died and one patient underwent cardiac \ntransplant, giving the proportion of death/cardiac death of 41%, and a death rate per patient \nmonth exposure of 0.03. In addition, 41% of the patients experienced a cardiac \nhospitalization at least once, and 55% of the patients died or had a cardiac hospitalization. \nPreliminary analysis of cardiac assessments demonstrate significantly elevated NT-Pro-BNP \nand troponin levels, abnormal functional status as assessed by the 6-minute walk test, and \nsignificant diastolic dysfunction and thickened ventricles as assessed by echocardiography \nand cardiac MRI.\nTafamidisB3461026Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012Page 18",

                        "Content": "Pfizer Inc is currently investigating tafamidis for the treatment of TTR-CM. Tafamidismeglumine [d-glucitol, 1-deoxy-1-(methylamino)-, 2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-6-benzoxazolecarboxylate (1:1)] is the meglumine salt form of 2-(3,5-dichloro-phenyl)-benzoxazole-6-carboxylic acid and is a novel, small molecule stabilizer of transthyretin. Specifically, tafamidis exhibits negative cooperative binding (i.e., dissociation constants of 2 nM [Kd1] and 154 nM [Kd2], respectively) to the two thyroxine binding sites on the native tetrameric form of TTR and thereby prevents its dissociation into monomers. At low pH, fibril formation of wild-type TTR and the most prevalent amyloidogenic variants, V30M and V122I, is potently inhibited by tafamidis. No fibril formation is observed for wild-type, V30M, and V122I variants at a 2:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry. Under urea denaturating conditions, only 33% of TTR tetramer dissociates after incubation for 72 hours with equimolar quantity of tafamidis, when negligible tetramer dissociation is observed at a 2:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry. Based on these data, it appears that a 1:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry should be sufficient to stabilize TTR. The normal range of TTR level is between 18 and 38 mg/dL, corresponding to 3.2 to 6.8 \uf06dM of TTR. Therefore, plasma levels of 3.6 to 7.2 \uf06dM (~1-2 \uf06dg/mL) of tafamidis should stabilize TTR levels at least to the upper limit of the normal range.In vitro addition of tafamidis to human plasma stabilizes wild-type, V30M, and V122I tetrameric TTR under strong urea denaturing conditions for at least four days. Under these same conditions most of the TTR is denatured in two days in the absence of stabilizer. Stabilization is observed at tafamidis concentrations between 3.6 and 7.2 \uf06dM for TTR plasma levels ranging from low (15.5 mg/dL [2.8 \uf06dM]) to high (28 mg/dL [5 \uf06dM]), confirming the effective therapeutic plasma level range between 3.6 and 7.2 \uf06dM (corresponding to ~1-2 \uf06dg/mL concentration of tafamidis in plasma). Ex-vivo results with plasma samples from initial Phase 1 clinical testing confirm this hypothesis and indicate that drug plasma levels between 0.7 to 1.7 \uf06dg/mL stabilize plasma TTR (when TTR plasma levels are between 16 and 36 mg/dL) after once a day dosing with tafamidis. Based on Phase 1 results, this drug level range would be achieved at steady-state after once-daily 20 mg (soft gelatin capsule), the tafamidis dose chosen for clinical evaluation.",

The results of the Fx1B-201 study will be used in the design of a Phase 3 program that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of tafamidis in TTR-CM.TTR-CM is a slowly progressing disease with a median survival of approximately 60 months [14, 15].

                        "Title": "Non-Clinical Experience with Tafamidis",
                        "Content": "Nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; ADME), and toxicology studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo in the mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog have been completed.  In vitro nonclinical studies have confirmed that the pharmacological activity of tafamidis is consistent with its high affinity binding to the two thyroxine binding sites of TTR in a non-cooperative manner and the resulting stabilization of TTR (wild type and amyloidogenic variants) by preventing dissociation of tetramers into monomers.The general safety pharmacology profile of tafamidis demonstrated minimal nonselective binding to enzymes or ion channels, with no potential for anti-inflammatory activity.  Tafamidis had minimal effects on either the central nervous system or cardiopulmonaryphysiology parameters in dogs. Tafamidis did not demonstrate the potential for QT prolongation. QTc shortening, observed at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg, was associated with total plasma concentrations that exceeded 90 \u00b5g/mL. However, mean human steady-state maximum concentration (Cmax) values following the daily therapeutic dose of 20 mg in elderly and nonelderly subjects were 2.8 and 2.3 \u00b5g/mL respectively. Given the 30 to 40-fold difference in exposures, it is felt that the nonclinical observations have little relevance to the clinical profile of tafamidis.Predictable pharmacokinetic behavior of tafamidis was demonstrated following oral administration in the nonclinical species. Tafamidis was absorbed following oral administration with an absolute bioavailability >90% and exhibited dose proportional increases in Cmax and AUC at dose up to 30 mg/kg, but further increases in the administered dose provided less than proportional increases in systemic exposure, indicating saturation in the drug absorption. Terminal plasma half life is about 40 hours following a single administration. Drug accumulation has been confirmed in repeated dose studies.Tafamidis is readily absorbed through the intestinal wall upon administration and is bound to a high extent to plasma proteins (>97%), essentially TTR and albumin. Tafamidis distributes widely in tissues (maternal and fetal), crosses the placental barrier to an extent of less than 5% of the initial dose, and ~ 30% of the dam\u2019s dose transferred into the milk.Tafamidis demonstrated a high degree of metabolic stability and its limited biotransformation resulted in the formation of a monoglucuronide (acylglucuronide) as the primary metabolite in most of the nonclinical species and humans, while a monooxidative product was only detected in the mouse and rabbit.  In rats, tafamidis is cleared primarily via biliary excretion and fecal elimination with some enterohepatic circulation, with a smaller contribution by the urine.  A human ADME study suggests similar pathways are operative in humans.Tafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 20\nTafamidis meglumine has been evaluated in vitro to assess protein binding, induction and \ninhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5), and \ninhibition of transporter protein P glycoprotein (P gp), with results suggesting very low \nlikelihood for clinical drug-drug interactions.  No significant CYP 450 inhibition was \nobserved.  A series of nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs to \nassess the safety of tafamidis. The absence of acute toxicity following a single dose of \ntafamidis up to 600 mg/kg in dogs is indicative of a low risk for overdose.  Tafamidis was \nwell tolerated following repeated daily oral administration up to 26 weeks in rats and \n39 weeks in dogs. The NOAEL was determined to be 30 mg/kg/day in the rat and \n45 mg/kg/day in dog. When doses were increased above the NOAELs, rodents had a drug \naccumulation in their stomachs while dogs vomited. Other signs of toxicity accompanied \nthese obvious signs, including decreased food intake, modified feces, stress related signs, \nincrease in liver weight and in liver enzyme levels, lymphoid depletion, and kidney lesions in \nrodents. \nTafamidis was nongenotoxic in a battery of in vitro studies, although a slight increase in \nfrequency of polyploid cells was observed at 100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL in the presence of \nS9 activation but not without metabolic activation in the in vitro chromosome aberration \nassay using human peripheral lymphocytes. Polyploidy is not considered to be a reliable \nsurrogate marker for aneugenicity.  The lack of risk for aneuploidy induction with tafamidis \nwas further evidenced by the lack of micronucleus induction in the bone marrow of \nSprague-Dawley rats at the doses producing Cmax and AUC values significantly exceeding \nthe predicted clinical exposures (~ 72X over the Cmax and ~ 67X over the steady state \nAUC(0-24) observed in humans, based on exposure in a 4-week rat study). The evaluation of \nthe carcinogenic potential in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice did not demonstrate an increase in \nthe incidence of neoplasia.\nTafamidis did not demonstrate any effects on fertility, general reproductive performance and \nearly embryo-fetal development in the rat and the maternal and paternal NOEL for \nreproductive toxicity was determined to be greater than 30 mg/kg/day. Developmental \ntoxicity was evident in the rat by reduced fetal weights in the 30 and 45 mg/kg/day maternal \ndosage groups (developmental NOAEL = 15 mg/kg). Developmental toxicity in the rabbit \nwas demonstrated by increased post-implantation loss, reduced fetal body weight and \nassociated skeletal variations, and malformation at 8 mg/kg and skeletal variations at \n2 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for developmental toxicity in rabbits was 0.5 mg/kg/day.\nTafamidis-related toxicity in the developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproduction toxicity \nstudy in rats resulted in a NOAEL for reproductive toxicity and for viability and growth of \nthe F1 generation of 5 mg/kg/day. Women of child-bearing potential should take measures \nto prevent pregnancy while being treated with tafamidis.\nNon-clinical data indicate that there is a large safety margin above the anticipated human \nefficacious plasma concentration and those concentrations associated with toxicity in rats or \ndogs. Emesis was the most common form of clinical intolerance in the dog. Owing to the \ndosing strategy, the immediate emetic activity led to apparent aspiration of gastric contents \nand/or drug, leading to moribundity and subsequent euthanasia. The gastric impaction and \nTafamidisB3461026Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012Page 21subsequent delayed gastric emptying, presumably followed by circulatory distress, shock and multiorgan failure, in rats was caused by a supraclinical dosing regimen and is not a relevant risk to human subjects. While the exact mechanism(s) for the toxicities observed following the oral administration of tafamidis has not been elucidated, there is an ample therapeutic margin to permit safe exposure to humans and there was no toxicity identified that would preclude human use, such as undetectable lesions or irreversible damage.No target organs of tafamidis-related toxicity were identified in the repeated dose toxicity studies conducted in rats or dogs (26 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively). However, in the CByB6F1 hybrid mouse and the tg.rasH2 mouse, the liver and/or kidney have been identified as target organs as non-neoplastic lesions were noted following treatment for 28 days (CByB6F1 hybrid mouse) or 26 weeks (tg.rasH2 mouse). Nephrosis was the primary lesion noted in the kidneys, only in male mice and in a dose-dependent manner. In the liver, centrilobular hypertrophy and scattered single cell necrosis were present in male mice more than in the female mice in terms of the incidence of both lesions and the severity of the centrilobular hypertrophy. The incidence of both liver lesions was dose dependent.However, the mouse (CByB6F1) did not demonstrate a unique monooxide metabolite that was not present in the rat or dog, nor has it been detected in the plasma of humans administered tafamidis.  However, a causal relationship between the monoxide metabolite and the liver and/or kidney lesions has not been established.Generally, there were no significant toxicities observed in the repeated dose toxicology studies in the rat and dog. Therefore, tafamidis was considered to be well tolerated in the rat at dose levels up to 30 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks, providing an exposure ratio of 45- to 63-fold based on the human AUC at steady state, and in the dog at dose levels up to 45 mg/kg/day for 39 weeks providing an exposure ratio of 29- to 36-fold based on the human AUC at steady state.  Additionally, there was no evidence for an increased risk of neoplasia at exposures at least 31-fold the human AUC nor was there evidence of any tafamidis-related genotoxicity.With the exception of the reproductive developmental toxicity findings, tafamidis has an excellent nonclinical safety profile.Refer to the Tafamidis Investigator Brochure for further details.",

                        "Content": "The clinical development program for tafamidis has included 13 controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials and two non-interventional, observational studies completed primarily in patients with TTR-FAP.  As of 13 May 2011, patients with TTR-FAP (n=127) received 20 mg of tafamidis administered daily for an average of 538 days (range of 15 to 994 days) or approximately 187 patient-years. The mean duration of exposure was 17.7 months: 87 were treated for at least 1 year, 43 were treated for at least 2 years, and 31 were treated for at least 30-<36 months.  The tafamidis 20 mg soft gelatin capsule (as used in the clinical studies) demonstrated a half-life average of 59 hours and Cavg(SS) average of 2.07 \u03bcg/mL (SD=0.20). The tafamidis 20-mg soft gelatin capsule daily dose resulted in an average fluctuation (peak to trough) of Tafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 22\n51.8%, with an average minimum concentration (Cmin) of 1.61 \u03bcg/mL and an average Cmax of \n2.66 \u03bcg/mL. The average range was consistent with the 1 to 2 \u00b5g/mL required to stabilize \nTTR levels beyond the upper limit of the normal range; steady state was attained within \n12 days, and exposure was consistent across subjects, with low variability across subjects for \nkey PK parameters.  Note that steady-state exposure was similar between males and females.  \nTherefore, the 20 mg daily dose has been used in the development program.  Further, based \non a population PK analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly or patients with \nhepatic or renal impairment. \nThe primary purpose of a therapy such as tafamidis is to stabilize the TTR tetramer, thus \ninhibiting the amyloid cascade and ultimately halting or slowing TTR-FAP disease \nprogression over a sustained period of time.  During the 18-month period of intervention in \nStudy Fx-005, tafamidis slowed the course of neurological impairment and maintained \nquality of life in treated patients. Together, with the extension Study Fx-006 data, tafamidis \ndemonstrated a sustained effect over 30 months, a period of time representing approximately \n25% of the average TTR-FAPPN disease duration of 10 years. Further, Study Fx1A-201 was \na small Phase 2II open label, single-treatment arm study designed primarily to determine the \nefficacy of tafamidis in stabilizing TTR variants other than the V30M (valine replaced by \nmethionine at position 30) mutation. The results from this study of non-V30M TTR-FAP\npatients, which represented an older, more severely affected patient population, strongly \nsupported the observed efficacy of tafamidis in V30M patients.  As in Study Fx-005, the \nconsistency of response across endpoints measuring different aspects of this multi-faceted \ndisease was again observed following 12 months treatment with tafamidis.  The results \nindicated the disease-modifying utility of tafamidis in treating all patients with TTR-FAPPN, \nregardless of mutation. \nStudy Fx1B-201 was a small Phase 2 study in TTR-CM in which a total of 35 patients were \nenrolled and analyzed, 31 patients with wild-type genotype and 4 with V122I genotype.  As \nexpected, the patients were elderly (mean age approximately 76 years), with significant \ndisease duration (approximately 8 years) and signs and symptoms of mild to moderate \ncardiac dysfunction (84% with NYHA Class I or II) at the time of enrollment.\nTafamidis effectively stabilized TTR in 34 of 35 (97.1%) patients, representing both \nwild-type and V122I, at Week 6, with approximately 88% stabilized throughout the \n12 months.\nFollowing 12 months treatment with tafamidis, along with routine standard of care, \n2/35 (5.7%) patients died, 9/35 (25.7%) experienced at least one cardiovascular \nhospitalization, and 9/35 (25.7%) experienced the composite endpoint of death or \ncardiovascular hospitalization.  Results were similar between the TTR genotype groups.  \nThese data were numerically better than that reported in the TRACS historical control cohort, \nduring which the 12-month rate of death, cardiovascular hospitalizations and \ndeath/cardiovascular hospitalizations were 6/29 (20.7%), 10/29 (34.5%) and 13/29 (44.8%), \nrespectively.\nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 23\nCardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin I and T) at baseline were elevated, which was not \nunexpected given the patients\u2019 underlying cardiac involvement.  The change in NT-proBNP \nover 12 months was relatively small, and numerically lower than that observed in TRACS.  \nTroponin I and T, more specific markers of cardiac necrosis, remained stable, suggesting no \nsubstantial deterioration of cardiac status over 12 months of tafamidis treatment.  These data \nare supported by the functional assessments of NYHA classification and 6MWT.  At \n12 months, 75% of the patients had improved or preserved NYHA classification, with the \noverall population demonstrating minimal change in distance walked (-11 meters).  This \nmaintained functional walking capacity is in contrast to the deterioration observed in TRACS \nat 12 months (-44 meters).\nNon-invasive cardiac assessments demonstrated significant cardiac involvement at baseline, \nwith substantial ventricular wall thickening (echocardiography and cardiac MRI) and \nelevated intra-cardiac filling pressures (echocardiography).  There were no consistent \nclinically relevant changes in these parameters over time (echocardiography).  For the \nwild-type patients (the majority of patients in the study), the deterioration in ejection fraction \n(-3.9) and stroke volume (-8.0) observed in the current study was less than that observed in \nTRACS (-10.5 and -15.4, respectively) at 12 months.  Similar findings were observed in a \nsubset of patients that underwent cardiac MRI.  An additional finding in cardiac MRI was a \ndecrease in percent of left ventricle (LV) mass with amyloid observed at 12 months in the \nsmall subgroup of patients undergoing this assessment, while there was an increase in LV \nmass with amyloid observed in TRACS. \nBaseline electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring demonstrated substantial \nconduction and rhythm abnormalities, including bundle branch blocks and atrial \nfibrillation/flutter.  There were no clinically relevant changes over time in these assessments, \nwith perhaps slight improvement in cardiac autonomic function as demonstrated by improved \nheart rate variability indices.\nOver the 12 months of tafamidis treatment, the patients\u2019 quality of life was maintained as was \ntheir functional status, as assessed by the SF-36, and KCCQ and PGA, respectively. The \nmajority of these results were also better when compared with TRACS. \nSeven patients participated in both TRACS (median follow up 12.5 months, with range of \n6-26 months) and in Study Fx1B-201. All seven patients completed 12 months of treatment \nwith tafamidis. However, given the small number of patients, it is difficult to assess whether \ndisease progression was different during treatment with tafamidis as compared to standard of \ncare in TRACS.  The rate of cardiovascular hospitalization was similar between the two \n12-month periods, with some evidence of stabilized cardiac function (ejection fraction and \nfractional shortening) observed following treatment with tafamidis. \nOverall, tafamidis was effective in achieving and maintaining TTR stabilization in both \nwild-type and V122I patients and showed an apparent stabilization of the progression of \ncardiac disease.\nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 24\nThe safety data described reflect exposure of 127 TTR-FAP patients to 20 mg of tafamidis \nadministered daily for an average of 538 days (ranging from 15 to 994 days).  The population \nwas composed of adult patients diagnosed with symptomatic TTR-FAP, with a mean age of \napproximately 44 years; approximately half of the patients were female, and approximately \n90% of the patients were Caucasian. Note that primary evidence of safety and efficacy was \nobtained from a placebo-controlled 18-month study in patients with TTR-FAP.  \nTable 1 provides a summary of the most common treatment emergent adverse events \n(TEAEs) (\u22655% in tafamidis treatment group) during study Study Fx-005. \nTable 1.\nSummary of Most Common (\u22655% in Tafamidis Treatment Group) \nTreatment-Emergent Adverse Events Sorted in Descending Incidence in the \nOverall Tafamidis Group \u2013 TTR-FAP Patients, Study Fx-005 (Safety \nPopulation)\nNumber (%) of Subjects \nMedDRA Preferred Term \nTafamidis 20 mg N=65 \nPlacebo N=63 \nNumber of patients with at least 1 AE \n60 (92.3) \n61 (96.8) \nDiarrhea \n17 (26.2) \n11 (17.5) \nUrinary tract infection \n15 (23.1) \n8 (12.7) \nPain in extremity \n11 (16.9) \n6 (9.5) \nHeadache \n10 (15.4) \n12 (19.0) \nInfluenza \n10 (15.4) \n9 (14.3) \nNasopharyngitis \n9 (13.8) \n8 (12.7) \nUpper abdominal pain \n8 (12.3) \n2 (3.2) \nNausea \n8 (12.3) \n8 (12.7) \nVomiting\n7 (10.8) \n8 (12.7) \nLacrimation decreased \n6 (9.2) \n7 (11.1) \nBack pain \n5 (7.7) \n4 (6.3) \nMyalgia \n5 (7.7) \n2 (3.2) \nPunctate keratits \n5 (7.7) \n3 (4.8) \nAnxiety \n4 (6.2) \n3 (4.8) \nConstipation \n4 (6.2) \n7 (11.1) \nDepression \n4 (6.2) \n3 (4.8) \nErectile dysfunction \n4 (6.2) \n4 (6.3) \nPeripheral edema \n4 (6.2) \n8 (12.7) \nPharyngitis \n4 (6.2) \n5 (7.9) \nThermal burn \n4 (6.2) \n5 (7.9) \nUpper respiratory tract infection \n4 (6.2) \n3 (4.8) \nVaginal infection \n4 (6.2) \n1 (1.6) \nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) were determined by including review of all treatment \nemergent adverse events, both serious and non-serious, regardless of investigator relatedness \nassessment, and review of vital sign data, laboratory data (including electrocardiogram data) \nTafamidis\nB3461026\nFinal Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012\nPage 25\nand discontinuations due to adverse events.  In addition, other factors taken into \nconsideration for the determination of ADRs included but were not limited to the mechanism \nof action of tafamidis, the known symptoms of the underlying TTR amyloidosis, the \ntemporality of the adverse event to the administration of tafamidis, and the relative rates of \ncomparative adverse events in the placebo groups in the controlled trials.  Based on the \nreview of the totality of the available safety data, it was determined that there are four \nadverse events for which there is basis to believe there is a causal relationship between their \noccurrence and the use of tafamidis; as such these adverse events were identified as ADRs, \nwith the incidence observed in the placebo-controlled 18 month Phase 2/3 Study \nFx-005 presented in Table 2.\nTable 2.\nSummary of Adverse Drug Reactions\nSystem Organ Class Preferred Term \nTafamidis N=65 n \n(%) \nPlacebo N=63 n (%) \nGastrointestinal disorders \nDiarrhea \n17(26) \n11(18) \nUpper abdominal pain \n8(12) \n2(3) \nInfections and infestations \nUrinary tract infection \n15(23) \n8(13) \nVaginal infection* \n4(12) \n1(3) \nThere were no meaningful changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, ECG \nparameters (including QTc interval), or other safety parameters measured.  No meaningful \nchanges in echocardiogram and ECG were observed for patients with a medical history of \ncardiomyopathy.  Tafamidis has been well tolerated by both healthy subjects during the \nPhase 1 clinical studies as well as in patients during the Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies.\nTafamidis was also studied in patients with TTR cardiomyopathy in Study Fx1B-201.  These \npatients were elderly (mean age 76 years) with signs and symptoms of mild to moderate \ncardiac dysfunction.  While there was no placebo control group, the adverse event profile of \ntafamidis reported during this study reflects the patients\u2019 underlying disease, co-morbid \nconditions, and elderly status.  The most frequent adverse events overall were related to the \nsymptoms and episodes of heart failure (dyspnea, cardiac failure and edema).  Eighteen \n(51.4%) patients reported at least one TEAE that was considered at least possibly related to \nstudy medication as assessed by the Investigator.  The most common (>5%) treatment-related \nTEAEs included balance disorder (14.3%), ageusia (8.6%), constipation, diarrhea, edema \nperipheral, fall, weight increased, and decreased appetite and dyspnea (5.7% each). The \nmajority (\u226585%) of patients experienced TEAEs considered mild or moderate in severity.  \nOne event of hyperkalemia reported during a hospitalization for decompensated heart failure \nand associated with acute renal failure was considered life-threatening, and not related to \ntafamidis.\nTafamidisB3461026Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012Page 26Complete information for this compound may be found in the Single Reference Safety Document, which for this study is the Investigators Brochure.",

The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury depends on the subject\u2019s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:\uf0b7Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST or ALT \uf0b33 times the upper limit of normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin \uf0b32 X ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase \uf0a32 X ULN or not available.\uf0b7For subjects with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above:\uf0b7For subjects with pre-existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT \uf0b32 times the baseline values and \uf0b33 X ULN, or \uf0b38 X ULN (whichever is smaller).\uf0b7Concurrent with\uf0b7For subjects with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: Total bilirubin increased by one time the upper limit of normal or \u22653 times the upper limit of normal (whichever is smaller).The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessment.  In addition to repeating AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/INR, and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced subject, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy\u2019s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy\u2019s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.TafamidisB3461026Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012Page 42",

A male has been exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception or is exposed during his partner\u2019s pregnancy.If a study subject or study subject\u2019s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study subject\u2019s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this information to Pfizer on an EIU Form (this is a specific version of the Serious Adverse Event Form).  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIU Form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information for all EIU reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up to the initial EIUForm.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: \uf0b7Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\uf0b7Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as serious adverse events when the investigator assesses the neonatal death as related or possibly related to exposure to investigational product.TafamidisB3461026Final Protocol Amendment 1, 14 June 2012Page 45Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the investigator.  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the study subject with the EIU Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.
