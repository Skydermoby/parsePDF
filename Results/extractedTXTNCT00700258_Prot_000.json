Participation in this registry is not meant to lead to a change in routine therapy, i.e. diagnostic and therapeutic practices of the physicians involved will not be affected. Temsirolimus, sunitinib and axitinib are subject to prescription requirements, and are physician prescribed. Study medication will not be provided within the scope of the registry. The registry will be reported to the German Association of Statutory Health Insurance, the umbrella association of health insurance funds, private health insurance funds, and to the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, according to \u00a7 67 Paragraph 6 AMG. This registry was registered based on the VFA recommendations for improving quality and transparency of non-interventional studies (May 2012). (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). The initial observational plan and the patient information sheet and informed consent form were submitted to the Ethics Committee in M\u00fcnster for review and received a positive opinion on 11/21/2007. The positive vote for Amendment I took place on 09/16/2009. The positive vote for Amendment II was on 06/17/2010, for Amendment III on 10/08/2012, for Amendment IV on 01/11/2016 and for Amendment V on 09/30/2016. With Amendment VI, an updated version of the patient information sheet and Informed Consent Form for advanced RCC comes into effect. Amendment VII specifies that the recruitment period is to be shortened by 12 months since, due to the new approval of ICI in combinations with other ICI or TKIs in the first line, the primary use of sunitinib in the therapy sequence shifts to subsequent lines of therapy and as a result, this also applies to the interim documentation and the documentation of axitinib. After evaluation of patient recruitment and inclusion into the various documentation stages, the number of patients calculated to answer the question (Amendment VI) was not reached within the extension period, and the question cannot be answered. Physicians participating in this registry agree to inform patients about the registry and obtain advance written informed consent from the patient. This includes the inclusion of pseudonymized patient data, the use of the data collected, and access to the medical records for review of the data by third parties. ",

                "Content": " Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for two percent of all malignant tumors with an age peak between 50 and 70 years of age; men are affected two times more often than women. Due to a lack of effective therapy, locally advanced RCC is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Following the Robert Koch Institute and the Gesellschaft der epidemiologischen Krebsregister in Deutschland e.V. (Society of Epidemiologic Cancer Registries in Germany), approximately 15000 men and women newly developed renal cell carcinoma in Germany in 2012. In contrast to most cancer types, the prevalence rate of RCC worldwide is increasing, with an estimated annual rate of 1.5 \u2013 5.9%. CCICCIPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n9 \n \nApproximately 40 - 45% of patients with RCC have \u201clocalized\u201d disease (stage I) at the time of diagnosis, \n10 - 20% of patients have \u201clocalized\u201d disease of stage II, 20% have \u201clocally advanced\u201d disease (stage III) and \n20 -30% have \u201cmetastatic\u201d disease (stage IV). \nIn addition, approximately 30% of patients who have \u201clocalized\u201d or \u201clocally advanced\u201d disease at the time of \ndiagnosis will develop metastases in the later course. \nThe lung is the most common metastatic site with 55%, followed by the lymph nodes (34%) and liver (33%) \nand the skeletal system (32%). Patients with stage II, III, and IV RCC have a 5-year survival rate of 80%, \n50 \u2013 60%, and 10%, respectively. 75 \u2013 85% of RCC cases are highly vascularized tumors overexpressing a \nrange of growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor \n(PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). \nMantle cell lymphoma (MCL) accounts for about five to ten percent of all Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphomas (NHL). \nMost new cases occur at an age of 60 - 65 years, with a majority of male patients (gender distribution about \n3:1). Due to the frequently aggressive course and diagnosis often only in advanced stages, the prognosis is poor \nand a cure by standard chemotherapy is generally not possible. \nThe incidence rate of MCL is two to three new cases per 100,000 residents annually. Standard of care is \nimmunochemotherapy in combination with rituximab as a first-line therapy. In addition, the importance of high-\ndose therapy appears to be confirmed for younger patients. Unlike established therapeutic recommendations for \nfirst-line therapy, there is no international consensus regarding a recommendation for therapy in a \nrelapsed/refractory situation. \nPrognosis of MCL is affected by the stage at first diagnosis (Ann Arbor classification). Only in highly localized \nstages (I/IE), long-lasting remission may be achieved by radiation therapy. In patients with stage II to IV, the \nmedian survival time is approximately three to five years, depending on feasibility of intensive therapy \nmeasures. Specifically in elderly patients or patients who cannot receive intensive therapy for other reasons, life \nexpectancy is low: After 5 years, fewer than 15% of these patients survive. \nMantle cell lymphomas are characterized by chromosomal translocation t (11;14) (q13;q32) leading to \noverexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA. Translation of this mRNA is an mTOR-dependent process that is inhibited \nby the specific mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. \nGastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are sarcomas that originate in connective tissue of the gastrointestinal \ntract. They are characterized by the expression of the surface molecule CD117 (c-KIT) and were only identified \nas a separate tumor entity a few years ago. \nGIST are a relatively rare disease in Germany with 1,500-2,000 new cases per year. If detected early, surgery \ncan achieve a complete cure. If the tumor is inoperable or metastatic, it is usually not possible to cure it. In this \nsituation, however, modern drugs such as sunitinib or imatinib mesylate can achieve significantly longer \nsurvival with a higher quality of life at the same time, compared to even a few years ago. \nInformation on Torisel\u00ae (temsirolimus) \nThe antineoplastic agent Torisel\u00ae contains temsirolimus (TEMS) as an active ingredient, a specific inhibitor of \nmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. Temsirolimus is the first mTOR kinase inhibitor approved for \ntumor therapy. The drug received its initial approval for intravenous treatment of advanced RCC in the first line \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n10 \n \nin adult patients who had at least 3 of 6 prognostic risk factors. In August 2009, the marketing authorization \nwas also extended for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory MCL. \nTemsirolimus binds to the intracellular protein FKBP-12. The protein-temsirolimus complex binds to and \ninhibits the activity of mTOR kinase, which plays a key role in the initiation and promotion of cell division. In \ncancer cells, inhibition of mTOR kinase can block the transcription of genes regulating the cell cycle. This \nmechanism also appears to be of particular importance in mantle cell lymphoma therapy. In addition, inhibition \nof mTOR kinase can lead to inhibition of increased expression of vascular cell growth factor (VEGF), which \nplays a role in the formation of new blood vessels. This can suppress vascularization in the tumor tissue and \nthus limit blood supply, which does not allow the tumor tissue to receive sufficient blood flow, causing it to die. \nThis mechanism appears to be of particular importance in renal cell carcinoma. Temsirolimus is used according \nto the Summary of Product Characteristics. \nThe named contraindications, warnings and precautions for use, side effects, interactions and instructions on \nthe dosage, type and duration of the application should be observed. According to the Summary of Product \nCharacteristics, pre-treatment with an antihistamine is advised. The Summary of Product Characteristics of \ntemsirolimus is part of this observational plan. \nInformation on Sutent\u00ae (sunitinib) \nThe oral multi-kinase inhibitor Sutent\u00ae (active substance sunitinib) is a so-called \u201csmall molecule\u201d. Sunitinib \nbinds intracellularly to the signal transduction pathways of the cell. This is accomplished by inhibiting multiple \nreceptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in tumor growth, pathological angiogenesis, and formation of \nmetastases. \nSunitinib has direct anti-proliferative effects by inhibiting VEGF and PDGF receptors on the tumor cell. \nSunitinib has extensive antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting the PDGF receptors a and \u00df to pericytes and VEGF \nreceptors 1-3 on endothelial cells. \nIn addition, sunitinib inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases c-KIT (Stem Cell Factor Receptor), Flt3 (FMS-like \ntyrosine kinase 3) and RET (Rearranged During Transfection Receptor) and thereby inhibits tumor growth and \nformation of metastases. \nSunitinib is used according to the Summary of Product Characteristics. The named contraindications, warnings \nand precautions for use, side effects, interactions and instructions on the dosage, type and duration of the \napplication should be observed. \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics of sunitinib is part of this observational plan. \nInformation on Inlyta\u00ae (axitinib) \nThe oral multikinase inhibitor Inlyta\u00ae (active substance axitinib) is a \u201csmall molecule\u201d. Axitinib is a potent and \nhighly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors VEGFR-1, \nVEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3, involved in pathological angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastases. Axitinib has \nbeen shown to be a potent inhibitor of VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation and cell survival. Inlyta\u00ae \nis used according to the Summary of Product Characteristics. The named contraindications, warnings and \nprecautions for use, side effects, interactions and instructions on the dose, type and duration of the application \nshould be observed. \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n11 \n \nThe Summary of Product Characteristics of axitinib is part of this observational plan. \nPatient Interview Advanced RCC \nFor the patient interview, the validated FKSI-15 questionnaire and the validated EQ-5D questionnaire/VAS will \nbe used to document the effect of the substances temsirolimus and/or sunitinib and/or axitinib by the patient. \nThe Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index-15 (FKSI-15) includes 15 questions \nsubdivided into 4 groups. Signs and symptoms, respiratory symptoms, quality of life, emotional symptoms. \nEuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) includes EQ-5D Index and EQ-Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

        "Content": " The treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma has undergone substantial changes in a very short time. In recent years, the introduction of various new substances for the treatment of advanced RCC has led to new scientific questions. Temsirolimus and sunitinib are current standard therapies in the first-line therapy of advanced RCC. Temsirolimus is approved for first-line treatment of advanced RCC in adult patients who have at least 3 of 6 prognostic risk factors. Sunitinib is approved for the treatment of advanced/metastatic RCC. Axitinib has been developed to treat advanced RCC in adult patients after failure of prior therapy with sunitinib or a cytokine. As of August 2009, temsirolimus is also another therapy option for patients with relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In addition, sunitinib is used in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) following imatinib failure or intolerance. In April 2016, the active substance nivolumab was approved as the first immuno-oncology medicinal product for monotherapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma in adults after previous therapy. In addition, in August 2016, the combination of lenvatinib/everolimus was approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC after previous treatment with therapy targeted towards the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and in September 2016, the active substance cabozantinib was approved for therapy of advanced RCC in adults after previous therapy targeting VEGF. Routine use of drugs in routine clinical practice is subject to additional challenges that are generally not fully covered by clinical trials. Therefore, the aim of this registry is to gain an overall picture regarding the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of temsirolimus, sunitinib, or axitinib therapy in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) under the conditions of routine use. In a highly evolving therapeutic setting for advanced RCC, reflected in the current S3 guideline, there is a lack of data from routine use of sunitinib, followed by novel therapy options, followed by axitinib, to assess the efficacy and tolerability of axitinib in the third or later line in a differentiated manner. Separate evaluations for third line use of axitinib following prior therapy with sunitinib in the first line followed by e.g. nivolumab, cabozantinib, or lenvatinib/everolimus in the second line are urgently needed. The efficacy of axitinib can continue to be documented after directly preceding therapy with sunitinib. These investigations allow a comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of axitinib in different lines. Therefore, the following information is of particular interest during the course of the investigation: \ufffd Efficacy (maximum response, survival time, progression-free time) \ufffd Treatment tolerability (assessment by physician) \ufffd Safety profile (overall incidence of adverse events and rate of side effects) of patients with advanced RCC, r/rMCL and GIST receiving treatment with temsirolimus, sunitinib, or axitinib \ufffd Profile, comorbidities and characteristics of patients receiving treatment with temsirolimus, sunitinib, or axitinib \ufffd The sequence of systemic therapies for advanced RCC, MCL, and GIST \ufffd Patient interview on quality of life in advanced RCC patients  CCICCIPF-05208748 B1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  FINAL, 09/28/2020   Pfizer - Confidential   13  Temporal sequence The following time points were defined as the minimum period for the implementation of the registry: \ufffd Patient Recruitment Phase: January 2008 \u2013 December 2020 \ufffd Recruitment rate: 100 patients/year per product \ufffd Average observation period per patient: 6 months for temsirolimus, 12 months for sunitinib, 6 months for axitinib \ufffd Field Phase: December 2021 \ufffd Total duration: 14 years + 1 year evaluation and report (2022)  Since the goal is to keep patients in the registry for life, the registry can be continued indefinitely. The end of data collection is scheduled for December 2021.  ",

The agreed fee refers to the workload for the provided documentation of treatment in the specified documentation sheet. Documentation Sheets (CRF) The report the findings, a special case report form will be provided, which will be completed by the participating physician in a timely manner at the time of enrollment, as well as at the regularly scheduled intervals, according to local guidelines (generally every 8-12 weeks), and at the end of treatment with temsirolimus, sunitinib, and axitinib. There is an option to document two of the above Pfizer substances on the white or green documentation forms. A pink additional case report form is used to document new therapeutic options in the second line, for example nivolumab, following sunitinib and before axitinib; patient questionnaires are omitted here. Since parts of the logistics (data collection and management, monitoring) are carried out by a contract research organization (Winicker Norimed GmbH, Nuremberg), the documentation should be sent back to the CRO. Prepared shipment labels will be provided for this. Pfizer Pharma GmbH will pay the costs. Documentation received by Winicker Norimed will be processed immediately and reviewed for completeness and plausibility of the documentation relating to pre-specified key fields. If any queries arise, they will be made in writing and directly to the physician. In addition, to assure data quality and verification of documented patient data, it is also planned to conduct monitoring visits at random sites. A reconciliation of the original patient data from the medical records with the available documentation will be performed. It is ensured that the transfer of all collected data to the Sponsor and to the contract research organization authorized to perform the evaluation will be performed in pseudonymized form in accordance with the federal data protection laws.

All records will be kept by the study site in accordance with applicable regulations, \nhowever for at least 10 years. \nIf for any reason the study site becomes unable to retain the study records for the required period (e.g. retirement, \nrelocation), Pfizer should be notified in advance. The study records must be transferred to another entity \nauthorized by Pfizer, such as another site, another practice, or an independent third party appointed by Pfizer. \nPrior to disposing of the study documents, the study site shall notify Pfizer in writing, even after the retention \nperiod has elapsed. \nQuality Control: \nIn a data validation plan (DVP), audits are defined for plausibility of the recorded data. As far as possible, these \naudits will be supported by programs, and queries will be submitted to sites by the CRO for deviations. \nOutcome and query resolution will be tracked and data changes are performed in the database as applicable. All \nchanges performed are logged in an Audit Trail File. \nIn addition, to assure data quality and verification of documented patient data, monitoring visits are planned at \nrandom selected sites. \nOther aspects: Not applicable. \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 B1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  FINAL, 09/28/2020   Pfizer - Confidential   18  ",

These requirements are described for three types of events: (1) serious adverse events (SAEs); (2) non-serious AEs and (3) scenarios where drug exposure occurs, including exposure during pregnancy, exposure during breastfeeding, medication errors, overdosing, incorrect use, extravasation, lack of efficacy, and occupational exposure. These events are defined in further detail in the section \u201cDefinitions of safety-relevant results\u201d.  Table 1: Requirements for documentation of safety-relevant events  Safety-relevant event Note on the documentation sheet Report to Winicker Norimed within 24 hours of awareness, using the NIS AE Reporting Form Serious AE All All Non-serious AE All Not applicable. Scenarios involving drug exposure, including exposure during pregnancy, exposure during breastfeeding, medication errors, overdose, incorrect use, extravasation, lack of efficacy, and occupational exposure All (regardless of whether they are related to an AE), excluding occupational exposure All (regardless of whether they are related to an AE)  The physician must follow up each AE and obtain appropriate information to determine the outcome of the AE and assess whether it meets the classification criteria for an SAE (see the section \u201cSerious Adverse Events\u201d below). CCICCIPF-05208748 B1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  FINAL, 09/28/2020   Pfizer - Confidential   21  The safety events listed in the right column of the above table must be reported to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH within 24 hours of the physician gaining knowledge, regardless of whether the physician sees an association between the event and the investigational medicinal product. In particular, in case of fatal or life-threatening SAEs, the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH must be notified immediately, regardless of the extent of the information available about the event. This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) of safety-relevant events already reported. In the rare instances where the physician is not immediately aware of the occurrence of a safety-relevant event, the physician must report the event within 24 hours of gaining knowledge of it, and document the time at which he first gained knowledge of the event. In case of safety-relevant events that are considered serious or which must be reported to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH in accordance with the right column of the above table after gaining knowledge thereof, the physician is obliged to follow up the event and submit all additional information to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH within 24 hours. In addition, a physician may be asked by CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH to obtain certain additional information more quickly. Such information may exceed the scope and detail of the information collected in the CRF about adverse events. Typically, this is a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. All other relevant information on the event such as concomitant medication and conditions must also be provided.

All safety-relevant events from the above table that occur during this period must be reported to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH. If a patient is given the medicinal product on the last day of the observation period, the reporting period should be extended to 28 calendar days after the end of the observation. In most cases, the date on the informed consent form is the date of the patient\u2019s inclusion in the study. In some situations, a time interval may lie between the date the informed consent form is provided and the inclusion into the study. In this case: If a patient provides the informed consent form but is never enrolled in the study (e.g. the patient changes his/her mind about participation or does not meet eligibility criteria), the reporting period will end on the day of the decision not to enroll the patient. Serious adverse events that occur after the completion of the non-interventional study (NIS) and the observation period must also be reported to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH if the physician sees a causal relationship with temsirolimus, sunitinib and axitinib. Causality assessment The physician must assess and document the causal relationship. For all AEs, the physician must obtain sufficient information to assess the causality of the AE.

Even if causality is ultimately assessed \nas \u201cunknown\u201d and the physician cannot determine whether the event was caused by temsirolimus, sunitinib and \naxitinib, the safety-relevant event must be reported within 24 hours. \nIf the physician cannot determine the cause of the event but is convinced that the event was not caused by \ntemsirolimus, sunitinib, and axitinib, it must be clearly documented on the CRF and the NIS AEM report form. \nDefinitions of safety-relevant events \nAdverse events (AEs) \nAn AE is any undesirable medical event in a patient taking a medicinal product. It is not necessarily \nrequired that the event is causally related to the treatment or use of the medicinal product. Examples of \nAEs include, among others: \n\ufffd \nAbnormal findings (circumstances where an abnormal finding is considered an adverse event are \nlisted below); \n\ufffd \nclinically important symptoms and signs; \n\ufffd \nchanges in physical examination findings; \n\ufffd \nhypersensitivity; \n\ufffd \nprogression/worsening of underlying disease; \n\ufffd \nlack of efficacy; \n\ufffd \nabuse of the medicinal product; \n\ufffd \ndependence on the medicinal product. \nIn medicinal products, this may also include signs or symptoms that have the following causes: \n\ufffd \noverdose of the medicinal product; \n\ufffd \ndiscontinuation of the medicinal product; \n\ufffd \nincorrect use of medicinal product; \n\ufffd \noff-label use; \n\ufffd \ndrug interactions; \n\ufffd \nextravasation; \n\ufffd \nexposure during pregnancy; \n\ufffd \nexposure during breastfeeding; \n\ufffd \nmedication errors; \n\ufffd \noccupational exposure. \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n23 \n \nAbnormal findings \nThe following criteria will determine whether an abnormal objective finding is reported as an AE: \n\ufffd \nThe findings are accompanied by symptoms and/or \n\ufffd \nthe finding requires further diagnostic or medical/surgical intervention and/or \n\ufffd \nwithin the study, the findings lead to a dose modification of the observed medicinal product or study \ntermination for the respective subject resulting in a significant additional concomitant treatment with \na medicinal product or another treatment, and/or \n\ufffd \nthe physician or sponsor classifies the findings as an AE. \nRecurring abnormal findings without the above conditions do not constitute an AE. An abnormal finding \nthat turns out to be an error does not need to be reported as an AE. \nSerious Adverse Events (SAEs) \nAn SAE is any undesirable medical event that occurs in a patient receiving a medicinal product or dietary \nsupplement (including infant formula) at any dose, and that \n\ufffd \nresults in death; \n\ufffd \nis life-threatening; \n\ufffd \nrequires an unforeseen hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization (circumstances that do not \nconstitute AEs are listed below); \n\ufffd \nresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial impairment of the ability to \nperform daily activities); \n\ufffd \nresults in a congenital malformation/birth defect \n \nProgression (including symptoms of progression) of the malignant disease assessed in the study must only be \nreported as a serious adverse event if it causes death during the study or within the observation periods \nspecified for reporting adverse events. Hospital treatment due to symptoms of progression of the malignant \ndisease is not reported as a serious adverse event. \nIf the malignant disease is fatal during the study or within the reporting periods specified for reporting adverse \nevents, the event that resulted in death must be documented as an Adverse Event and reported as a serious \nadverse event of grade 5 CTC (Common Toxicity Criteria). \nIn addition, medically significant adverse events must be classified as \u201cserious\u201d. The determination of whether \nan event is medically significant is performed according to medical and scientific judgment. Medically \nsignificant events are those that are not directly fatal or life threatening or lead to hospitalization. However, if \nthe event presents a risk for the patient or requires medical action to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in \nthe above definition, the medically significant event must be reported as serious. \nExamples of such events include intensive medical treatment for an allergic bronchospasm in the emergency \nroom or at home; changes in blood counts or seizures that do not result in hospitalization; or development of a \ndependency on the medicinal product or abuse of the medicinal product. \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n24 \n \nIn addition, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) by a Pfizer \nmedicinal product is considered to be serious. Suspicion of such an event occurs when clinical symptoms or \nlaboratory findings suggestive of infection occur in a patient following \nuse of a Pfizer medicinal product. The terms \u201csuspected transmission\u201d and \u201ctransmission\u201d are used \nsynonymously. These cases are considered unexpected and are expedited by team members of the \npharmacovigilance department as serious cases. In such cases, an event may also be reported as a product \ndeficiency. \nHospital stay \nA hospital stay is defined as any initial admission (even shorter than 24 hours) to a hospital or appropriate \nhealthcare facility or prolongation of hospitalization. \nThe admission also includes a transfer within the hospital to an acute intensive care unit (e.g. from psychiatry \nto a general unit, from a general unit to a coronary unit, from neurology to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency \nroom visit is not necessarily a hospital stay; however the event that causes an emergency room visit will need \nto be assessed with regard to medical significance. \nA hospital stay without any medical AE is not considered an AE and is not reportable. For example, the \nfollowing hospitalizations do not need to be reported without a medical AE: \n\ufffd \nAdmission for social reasons (e.g. patient has no place to sleep) \n\ufffd \nAdmission for formal reasons (e.g. for an annual examination) \n\ufffd \nOptional admission not triggered by a medical event (e.g. elective cosmetic surgery) \n\ufffd \nHospitalization for observation without the presence of a medical AE \n\ufffd \nAdmission for treatment of a pre-existing condition not associated with the development of a new AE or \nworsening of this illness (e.g. to clarify a persistent laboratory abnormality that has already occurred prior \nto treatment) \n\ufffd \nProtocol-specific admission during the clinical trial (e.g. for a procedure required by the protocol) \nScenarios to be reported to CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH within 24 hours \nThe following scenarios are described below: Exposure during pregnancy, exposure during breastfeeding, \nmedication errors, overdose, misuse, paravasation, lack of efficacy and occupational exposure. \nExposure during pregnancy \nExposure During Pregnancy (EDP) applies if: \n1. a woman who is receiving or has been exposed to temsirolimus, sunitinib, and axitinib (e.g. environmental \nexposure) becomes pregnant or a pregnancy is determined, or the woman has become pregnant after \nstopping or after being exposed to temsirolimus, sunitinib, and axitinib, or a pregnancy is determined under \nthese conditions (maternal exposure. \n \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n25 \n \nAs an example of environmental exposure, a case of a pregnant woman in direct contact with a Pfizer product \nis: \n\ufffd \nA nurse reported her pregnancy and was exposed to a chemotherapeutic agent). \n\ufffd \na man was treated before or around the time of conception with temsirolimus, sunitinib, and axitinib or \nhad contact with temsirolimus, sunitinib and axitinib and/or had contact with the medicinal product \nduring the pregnancy of his partner (paternal exposure). \nGenerally, all prospectively and retrospectively reported exposures during pregnancy must be reported, \nregardless of whether or not an adverse event has occurred. Such exposures should be reported as serious \nadverse events. \nIf a subject or partner of a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study treatment with temsirolimus, \nsunitinib and axitinib, or if pregnancy is determined, this information must be reported to the CRO Winicker \nNorimed GmbH immediately with the NIS-AEM report form, regardless of the occurrence of an AE. \nIn addition, information regarding environmental exposure to temsirolimus, sunitinib, and axitinib in a pregnant \nwoman (e.g. if a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytostatic agent by inhalation or \nspills) must be reported using the NIS-AEM report form. This should be done independently of the occurrence \nof an AE. \nThe information submitted must include the estimated delivery date (see below for information regarding \ntermination of the pregnancy). \nFollow-up takes place to obtain general information about the pregnancy. In addition, follow-up will be \nperformed to collect information on the outcome of exposure during pregnancy (EDP) for all EDP reports where \nthe outcome of the pregnancy was unknown. Any pregnancy will be followed up until conclusion or termination \n(e.g. termination of pregnancy), and CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH will be notified of the outcome. This \ninformation will be provided as follow-up to the original EDP report. In case of a live birth, the newborn\u2019s \nexternal integrity may be assessed at the time of birth. \nIn the event of termination of the pregnancy, the respective reasons should be specified and, if clinically \npossible, the external integrity of the aborted fetus should be assessed by visual examination (unless the test \nresults obtained prior to the procedure show congenital malformation and the results are reported). \nIf the pregnancy outcome meets criteria for an SAE (e.g. extrauterine pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, \nstillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital malformation [in a live birth, an aborted fetus, stillbirth, or neonatal \ndeath]), the SAE reporting procedures are to be followed. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes \nreported as SAEs will be collected for the following events: \n\ufffd \nSpontaneous abortion (including miscarriage and retained abortion); \n\ufffd \nNeonatal death occurring within 1 month of birth; these are reported as SAEs regardless of causality. \nAlso, any infant deaths occurring after the first month of life must be reported as SAEs if the physician \nsees a connection or suspected connection with exposure to the study medication and the infant\u2019s death. \n \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n26 \n \nAdditional information may be requested regarding exposure during pregnancy. Further follow-up of post-\ndelivery is handled individually (e.g. follow-up of premature infants to identify developmental delays). \nIn the event of paternal exposure, the subject receives a form for the release of information for the pregnant \npartner, which he should give to his female partner. It must be documented that this letter was given to the \nsubject to give to his partner. \nExposure during breastfeeding \nExposure during breastfeeding scenarios must be reported regardless of whether there is an AE related to \nexposure. If a Pfizer product (e.g. vitamins) approved specifically for use in nursing mothers is used as specified, \na report of exposure during breastfeeding is not required. However, if an AE occurs in the infant in relation to \nthe use of such a medicinal product, the AE should be reported together with exposure during breastfeeding. \nMedication Errors \nA medication error is any inadvertent error in prescribing, dispensing or administering a medicinal product by \na healthcare professional, patient or user that can result in improper use of the medicinal product or injury to \nthe patient. Such events may be related to medical practice, healthcare products, procedures, or systems \nincluding prescription, communication of instructions, labeling, packaging and nomenclature of the medicinal \nproduct; self-preparation; dispensing; distribution; management; training; monitoring; and application. \nMedication errors include, among others: \n\ufffd \nNear accidents, regardless of a patient\u2019s direct involvement (e.g. accidental/erroneous administration, \nwhich is the inadvertent use of any medicinal product in deviation from the product information or \nprescription by the physician or the patient/user); \n\ufffd \nConfusion regarding a trade name (e.g. trade name, brand name). \nThe physician must report the following medication errors to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH regardless of \nwhether an AE/SAE related to it is present: \n\ufffd \nMedication errors that include the patient\u2019s exposure to the medicinal product, regardless of whether \nthe medication error is associated with an AE. \n\ufffd \nMedication errors that do not directly affect a patient (e.g. potential medication errors or near accidents). \nIf a medication error does not include patient exposure to the medicinal product, the medication error \nreport must contain the following minimum information: \n\ufffd \nan identifiable reporter; \n\ufffd \na suspected medicinal product; \n\ufffd \na medication error. \n\ufffd \nOverdose, misuse, \n\ufffd \nextravasation; \nReports of misuse, overdose and extravasation related to the use of a Pfizer medicinal product are to be reported \nby the physician to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH, regardless of the presence of an associated AE/SAE. \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 B1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  FINAL, 09/28/2020   Pfizer - Confidential   27  Lack of efficacy Reports of lack of efficacy for a Pfizer medicinal product are to be reported by the physician to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH, regardless of the presence of an associated AE/SAE or the area of application of the medicinal product.  Occupational exposure Reports of occupational exposure related to the use of a Pfizer medicinal product are to be reported by the physician to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH, regardless of the presence of an associated AE/SAE. Reference Document for Safety Information The temsirolimus, sunitinib and axitinib Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) will serve as a reference during the study which the Pfizer safety department will use to assess all safety events reported by physicians to the CRO Winicker Norimed GmbH.

An annual interim analysis will be performed. \nDefinition of analysis set \nAll prospectively documented patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, MCL, \nand GIST will be included in the \u201csafety population\u201d. \nAll patients to whom at least one of the following criteria apply will be included in the \u201cefficacy population\u201d: \nDate of death, time of progression, physician\u2019s assessment of therapy response, or therapy assessment of \nefficacy and tolerability by the physician are available. \nRetrospectively documented information will not be included in the analysis. \nAnalysis of Safety Criteria \nThe absolute and relative frequency of patients with adverse events will be shown in a tabular form, both \nglobally and according to the system organ classes and the MedDRA \u201cpreferred terms\u201d. In addition, the absolute \nand relative frequency of therapy dropouts will be presented both overall and according to discontinuation \nreasons. Serious adverse events will be evaluated separately. Previous and concomitant therapies will also be \ntabulated. \nLaboratory analysis and electrocardiogram results will be analyzed per visit. In addition, the physician will \nassess information on tolerability during therapy. \nAnalysis of Efficacy Criteria \nThe change in disease activity will be described using the following parameters: \n\ufffd \nAssessment of response to therapy by the physician \n\ufffd \nPhysician\u2019s assessment of efficacy \n\ufffd \nOverall survival (OS) \n\ufffd \nProgression-free survival (PFS) \n\ufffd \nMaximum Response \nFor the analysis in STAR-TOR, the duration of treatment is defined as the period between inclusion in the \nregistry and occurrence of any of the events of either death or discontinuation of the documentation or \ntermination of therapy. \nThe duration of treatment will be evaluated using methods from the field of \u201csurvival time analysis\u201d. \nOther analysis parameters \nComorbidities will be coded in accordance with MedDRA and concomitant medications according to WHO-\nDD. Frequencies for appropriate coding levels will be presented. Evaluation of sequence and therapy regimens \nand quality of life (advanced RCC) will be performed. \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n36 \n \nCase number estimate \nIn total, the treatment of approximately 100 patients per year and product should be documented. This number \nof patients was chosen to capture a broad range of medical prescription habits and assess the target criteria as \nsignificantly as possible. The probability of occurrence of at least one \u201cuncommon\u201d (>1/1000, <1/100) AE is \nbetween 0.33 and 0.98 and for a \u201crare\u201d AE (>1/10,000, <1/1000), between 0.04 and 0.33. \nThe planned number of 200 sites to be included according to Amendment III allows a representative cross-\nsection across German oncology practices or clinics. \nWith Amendment VI, the efficacy of axitinib regarding the progression-free survival and overall survival is to \nbe evaluated in the 3rd (and 4th) line of therapy and a correlation with patients on axitinib in the 2nd line of \ntherapy is to be performed. \nPatients already documented in STAR-TOR (n = 92; status of 06/30/2017) who received axitinib in the 2nd line \nof therapy, i.e. with a treatment course of sunitinib-axitinib, will be used as a (historical) comparison group for \nthe comparison with the 3rd and 4th line of therapy, particularly because patients with axitinib in the 2nd therapy \nline are only rarely expected after the guideline amendments and therefore cannot be newly enrolled. \nPatients already documented in STAR-TOR with axitinib in the 3rd line of therapy or 4th line of therapy should \nnot be used to answer the expanded question (see above) as none of these patients received nivolumab or another \nactive substance newly approved in 2016 in the 2nd line of therapy, but received other therapeutic options. It \ncannot be excluded that the deviating pretreatment/treatment course will impact the efficacy of axitinib in the \nsubsequent lines of therapy as compared with current therapy guidelines. \nApproximately 45 patients with a PFS event should be documented in the 3rd line with axitinib after the previous \ntherapy sequence, e.g. sunitinib - nivolumab. Therefore, mPFS and mOS can be estimated with sufficient \nprecision (see Statistical Analysis Plan). In order to recruit 45 new third-line axitinib patients after e.g. sunitinib-\nnivolumab pretreatment in STAR-TOR, approximately 45 months will be required (assuming the usual therapy \nperiods). \nAssuming that the last patient is enrolled after 45 months and a progression event (or death) occurs after \napproximately 6 months, a runtime of approximately 4 years should be assumed after implementation of \nAmendment VI. \nWith Amendment VII, the additional documentation period defined in Amendment VI is reduced by one year. \nAs of September 15, 2020, 17 patients were registered in an interim documentation. Of these, 2 patients received \nfollow-up therapy with axitinib. It is shown that the approval of three new ICI combinations which are all \nprominently represented in guidelines has reduced recruitment for sunitinib patients in first-line therapy \n(prerequisites for later use of axitinib) and/or has been moved to later lines of therapy. Documentation of 45 \npatients in the stated time does not seem possible at this recruitment rate to answer the question of Amendment \nVI. Therefore, the further recruitment phase is reduced by one year (to the end of December 2020). \nDiscussion of potential bias sources \nIn this non-interventional registry, the selection of documented patients is not subject to a randomization \nmechanism, so that a selection bias cannot be excluded. \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-05208748 \nB1771009, Observational Plan, Amendment VII  \nFINAL, 09/28/2020 \n \n \nPfizer - Confidential \n \n \n37 \n \nA comparison of the safety and efficacy of temsirolimus, sunitinib, and axitinib is planned. Potential \nconfounders will be considered and will be included in the statistical analysis plan accordingly.
