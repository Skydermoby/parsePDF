        "Content": " As per ICH E9, the purpose of this document is to provide a more technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features of the analysis described in the protocol, and to include detailed procedures for executing the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data. This Trial Statistical Analysis Plan (TSAP) assumes familiarity with the Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP), including Protocol Amendments. In particular, the TSAP is based on the planned analysis specification as written in CTP Section 7 \u201cStatistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size\u201d. Therefore, TSAP readers may consult the CTP for more background information on the study, e.g., on study objectives, study design and population, treatments, definition of measurements and variables, planning of sample size, randomization.\u201d SAS\u00ae Version 9.2 will be used for all analyses.

        "Title": "CHANGES IN THE PLANNED ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY",
        "Content": " The following changes to those statistical methods described in the CTP and its subsequent amendments were made: \u2022 The CTP describes that the effect of Afatinib on PFS compared with standard chemotherapy will be tested at the one-sided, 0.025 significance level.  This is identical to the effect of Afatinib being tested at the more commonly used two-sided, 0.05 (5%) significance level if the treatment effect is in favour of Afatinib.  In order to aid in the interpretation of this study two-sided p-values will therefore be presented throughout. \u2022 Further details to those given in the CTP have been provided for the timing of the statistical analyses; refer to Section 7 for further details. \u2022 An additional row (3d) was added to the Table 7.4: 1 to cover a scenario that had not been considered at the time of writing the CTP. \u2022 The CTP specifies that patients who are randomised but never receive randomised treatment will be censored on the day of randomisation, for both PFS and overall survival (OS) analyses.  In order to handle all randomised patients the same, irrespective of whether they received randomised treatment or not, the above censoring rule will not be considered.  Refer to Table 7.4: 1 for a complete list of censoring rules. \u2022 The CTP specifies that if a Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) assessments is missed, but followed by another assessment which shows deterioration then the time to deterioration will be defined as the mid-point of the two available assessments immediately before and after the missed assessments.  As it was thought that this planned imputation was likely to be a rare occurrence as well as being unnecessarily complicated it will not be performed.  Refer to Section 7.5.2.4 for further details. \u2022 The time to deterioration in body weight and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status endpoints have been removed as descriptive summaries of changes from baseline will suffice.  Refer to Section 7.5.2 for further details. \u2022 The CTP states that adverse events will be compared over a period of time equivalent to six courses of chemotherapy, such a comparison was included due the expected difference in length of treatment exposure between the two treatment groups.  This analysis has been replaced by exposure adjusted adverse event incidence rate summaries which have the benefit of not excluding any treatment emergent adverse events from summary.  Refer to Section 7.8.1 for further details. \u2022 The list of laboratory parameters to be focussed upon detailed in the CTP was revised; refer to Section 7.8.2 for further details.

For appendix tables, the set of summary statistics is: N / Mean / StD / Min / Q1 (lower quartile) / Median / Q3 (upper quartile) / Max. Tabulations of frequencies for categorical data will include all possible categories and will display the number of observations in a category as well as the percentage (%) relative to the respective treatment group. Percentages will be rounded to one decimal place. The category missing will be displayed only if there are actually missing values. Percentages will be based on all patients in the respective patient set whether they have non-missing values or not. The primary analysis will take place when 217 patients have progressed or died, as assessed by independent review.  The time point of the data cut-off (extract of data from BI database) for sending the latest data packages (radiological scans and completed dossiers) for independent review will be determined by the progression and death data from the investigator assessments.  Based upon the discrepancy observed (on blinded data) between the number of events from the independent review (ongoing during the trial) and the investigator assessments the time point for observing 217 independent review events will be estimated.  All data up to and including this time point (including response data from patients who did not progress) will be sent for independent review.  The estimation of this time point is likely to lead to some deviation, though relatively small, from the planned 217 independent review events.  The trial will only be un-blinded after the independent review data has been received back, loaded into the database and considered final. A second analysis, primarily for assessing OS, will be performed when approximately 209 have died. The timing of this analysis may be adjusted to coincide with future regulatory submissions or if an update is required at the time a decision is being made regarding regulatory approval.

The date of progression for the primary analyses will be determined by an independent central imaging review incorporating both radiologist and oncologist reviews, blinded to treatment assignments.  The primary endpoint analysis will be performed on the randomised set of patients. A stratified log-rank test (two-sided, 0.05 significance level) will be used to test the effect of Afatinib on PFS compared with standard chemotherapy.  The test will be stratified by EGFR mutation group (L858R, Del 19 or Other), according to the patient data entered in the CRF. A Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by EGFR mutation group will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the two treatment groups.  Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% CIs (using Greenwood\u2019s standard error estimate) will be tabulated at 3-monthly time points and will include a comparison of the treatment groups using a z-test (approximation of the normal distribution).  Kaplan-Meier curves for the two treatment groups will also be produced. The assumption of proportional hazards within each EGFR mutation group and the homogeneity of the hazard ratio across the EGFR mutation groups will be checked descriptively.

All scoring of the symptom scales/items will follow the EORTC scoring algorithm. The analyses will focus on cough, dyspnoea and pain; specifically: \u2022 Cough: Q1 - How much did you cough? (QLQ-LC13) \u2022 Dyspnoea: Composite of: Q3 - Were you short of breath when you rested? Q4 - Were you short of breath when you walked? Q5 - Were you short of breath when you climbed stairs? (QLQ-LC13).  Individual item from QLQ-C30, Q8 - Were you short of breath? \u2022 Pain: Composite of: Q9 - Have you had pain? Q19 - Did pain interfere with your daily activities? (QLQ-C30).  Individual items from QLQ-LC13, Q10 - Have you had pain in your chest? Q11 - Have you had pain in your arm or shoulder? Q12 - Have you had pain in other parts of your body? For each of the summary scales and items measuring the above the treatment groups will be compared for the following: Distribution of patients improved, stable or worsened Improvement will be defined as a score that improves from baseline by at least 10 points (on the 0-100 point scale) at anytime during the study.  If a patient has not improved, worsening will be defined as a 10 point worsening at anytime during the study.  Otherwise, a patient will be considered as stable. The number and percentage of patients falling into each of these three categories will be summarised by treatment group.  A logistic regression model, stratified by EGFR mutation group will be used to compare the distribution of patients improving/not improving across the two treatment groups. Time to deterioration Time to deterioration (months) is defined as the time from randomisation to an increase (worsening) from the baseline score of at least 10 points on the 0-100 point scale.  Patients that die during the period of interest with no evidence of a deterioration will be considered to have deteriorated at the time of death. This time to event data will be analysed and summarised using the same methodology as for the primary efficacy endpoint, refer to Section 7.4.  The results of the analyses will be displayed using Forest plots. Patients with no deterioration (including those with disease progression) will be censored at the last available HRQOL assessment date; patients with no post-baseline assessments will be censored on the day of randomisation.

The models will allow the slope to change at 3, 6, 12 and 18 weeks.  Each model will also include the two random effects of intercept and slope (time from randomisation).  The area under the estimated growth curve (AUC) up to the median follow-up time will be calculated as a summary measure for each treatment group; this will be divided by the median follow-up time so that it can be interpreted as the mean HRQOL score up to the median follow-up time.  The treatment effect will be estimated as the average difference between the treatment group means scores, together with a 95% confidence interval and associated p-value based on a t-statistic with degrees of freedom calculated using the Kenward-Roger method.  The results of the analyses will be displayed using Forest plots.       In addition, all single items and subscales (functional and symptom) from both questionnaires will be analysed in a similar fashion to summarise the impact of therapy over the entire profile of the measures, and to examine the consistency of component items with the composite measures. Note as higher scores represent a \u2018better\u2019 level of functioning; deterioration in scales/items related to functioning will be defined as a decrease from baseline score of at least 10 points. Finally, the usage of cough, dyspnoea and pain medication along with the incidence of cough and dyspnoea AEs will be described. ",
