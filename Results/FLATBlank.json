        "chunk_text": " The r-h\u03b1GAL enzyme (Fabrazyme) is a highly purified form of human \u03b1GAL, made by recombinant DNA technology.  It is well known that immune response may occur following treatment with exogenous human proteins.  In the setting of an endogenous enzyme deficiency, infusion of an exogenous recombinant enzyme to patients\u2019 na\u00efve to the normal enzyme is expected to cause antibody response to the enzyme.  Of the 177 patients evaluated in 7 clinical studies in which a Fabrazyme dose of 1 mg/kg every two weeks (q2w) was used for the duration of the study, the majority developed IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies to Fabrazyme: 84% of 163 males and 43% of 14 females seroconverted. Seroconversion occurred in a mean (SD) time of 194.5 (130.24) days for the 6 females compared to 76.2 (71.16) days for the 124 males.  Of the (electronic    2.0)Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 08  \n23-Mar-2018 \nGZ419828/AGAL02603 - agalsidase beta \nVersion number: 1 \nProperty of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential \nPage 14 \n143 seropositive patients, the majority (a combined total of 66%) exhibit either consistently low \ntiters or declining titers over time.  Continued safe treatment with Fabrazyme has not been \nprecluded by IgG antibody development.  Across the 7 pooled clinical studies of Fabry patients \ntreated with Fabrazyme 1 mg/kg q2w, the most common drug-related AEs were infusion \nassociated reactions (IARs, defined as drug- related events occurring on the day of the infusion).  \nThe most common IARs included chills, pyrexia, nausea, feeling cold, headache, vomiting, \nparaesthesia, blood pressure increased, flushing, feeling hot, chest discomfort, pruritus, body \ntemperature increased, urticaria, fatigue and somnolence.  Most IARs were mild to moderate in \nintensity and non-serious. \nThere is no adequate safety data for the use of Fabrazyme in pregnant or lactating women or the \npossible effects on their infants.  It is not known if Fabrazyme passes through the placenta to the \nembryo or if it is excreted in breast milk.  Maternal IgG antibodies may be passively transferred \ntransplacentally or via breast milk to the fetus/infant.  Whether maternal administration of \nFabrazyme can lead to an IgG and/or IgM (immunoglobulin M) antibody response to Fabrazyme \nby the fetus/infant is not known. \nSome study specific procedures may cause increased risk to the mother or infant, eg, risks \nassociated with phlebotomy include fainting, hematoma, excessive bleeding, or infection. \n \n  \nA small number of patients have experienced anaphylactoid reactions some of which were \nconsidered life-threatening.  Signs or symptoms of possible anaphylactoid reactions have included \nevents of localized angioedema, generalized urticaria, bronchospasm, and hypotension.  The risks \nand benefits of re-administering Fabrazyme following a severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid \nreaction should be carefully considered. \nA complete overview of the safety profile of Fabrazyme can be found in the Investigator\u2019s \nBrochure and/or product labeling. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n2.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 08  23-Mar-2018 GZ419828/AGAL02603 - agalsidase beta Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 15 ",

All AEs ongoing at the time of withdrawal, study termination, or study completion require a follow up at approximately 28 days after discontinuation of study participation.  The Investigator will be asked to follow-up on all SAEs that were ongoing at the time of withdrawal, termination or completion until resolution, until both the sponsor and investigator agree follow-up is deemed no longer medically necessary or until the patient is lost to follow-up. If any new SAEs are identified during the course of this follow-up of ongoing SAEs, additional follow-up of these new SAEs may be performed.  The Investigator and sponsor will determine if the follow-up is clinically warranted and relevant to the evaluation of the safety of the trial treatment or until patient is lost to follow up.

Persistent or significant disability/incapacity: the AE that resulted in a substantial disruption of a person\u2019s ability to conduct normal life functions. Important medical events based upon appropriate medical judgment, that may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above: an AE that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the adverse drug/biologic event using the following categories: Mild, Moderate, and Severe. This assessment is subjective and the Investigator should use medical judgment to compare the reported AE to similar types of events observed in clinical practice. Below are listed guidelines for severity assessment: Mild: Symptom(s) barely noticeable to the subject/patient or does not make the subject/patient uncomfortable.  The AE does not influence performance or functioning.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s). Moderate: Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make the subject/patient uncomfortable. Performance of daily activities is influenced. Treatment of symptom(s) may be needed. Severe: Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to cause the subject/patient severe discomfort. Severity may cause cessation of treatment with the study drug.  Treatment for symptom(s) may be given.

Since \u03b1GAL is a protein, it is a normal component of breast milk and  it is possible that the women enrolled in the study naturally produce \u03b1GAL in the breast milk  samples. The current assay cannot differentiate between endogenous \u03b1GAL and Fabrazyme. As  breast milk samples are not available prior to the mother having started Fabrazyme therapy, breast  milk samples will be tested just prior to the Fabrazyme infusion and at timed intervals as specified  above (see Section 9.3) to see if there is an increase in the \u03b1GAL levels in breast milk.  Each breast milk collection should first be measured for total volume. An aliquot of each breast  milk sample collected at the site is to be set aside for testing and the remainder of the sample may  be fed to the infant. Refer to the SOM for further details on breast milk sampling.  ",
