                "Content": " Rationale Despite progress in therapy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable.  Response rates are promising but remain transient and all subjects eventually relapse.  There is currently no approved maintenance therapy.  The objective of this study is to evaluate if maintenance therapy with ofatumumab will prolong remission duration.   Objective(s) The primary objective is to evaluate progression free survival (PFS) of ofatumumab maintenance treatment versus no further treatment after remission induction in subjects with relapsed CLL. Secondary objectives are to evaluate clinical benefit, safety, tolerability and health-related quality of life of subjects treated with ofatumumab versus no further treatment.  An additional secondary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics in CLL subjects on maintenance ofatumumab. Study Design This is an open-label, two-arm, randomized, Phase III study of ofatumumab or no further treatment in subjects in CR or PR after remission induction treatment for relapsed CLL. A total of 280 events are needed for the study to have 80% power to detect a 40% difference in PFS between study arms.  Subjects in CR or PR after remission induction treatment for relapsed CLL will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ofatumumab maintenance or no further treatment in order to obtain 478 evaluable subjects (assuming a 10% drop out).   An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be used for 2 interim analyses. The first interim analysis will assess safety endpoints after 100 subjects in the maintenance arm have been treated for at least 6 months.  The second interim analysis of will assess efficacy of the primary endpoint, progression free survival, as well as evaluate safety and will be performed when 2/3 of the total number of events have occurred (187 events) utilizing a conservative significance level (0.001).  As the significance level was met at the interim efficacy analysis, further enrollment in the study will be discontinued.  There will be no changes to the study design, treatment, assessments, or follow-up. The final analysis will be conducted at the significance level of 0.0498.  Further details are specified in the IDMC charter. At screening, upon informed consent, peripheral blood samples, physical assessment, CT scan (to confirm CR or PR) will be obtained to determine disease status and study eligibility.  Bone marrow examination may be done ONLY to confirm CR.  Refer to Appendix 1: Time and Events for complete list of screening procedures.  Novartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 13 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nEligible subjects will be stratified at randomization based on: \n1) CR or PR at study entry \n2) Number of previous induction treatments (2 vs 3) \n3) Type of prior treatment :  chemoimmunotherapy, only alkylating monotherapy, or \nother treatment  \nDuring the treatment phase, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either: \nArm A:  ofatumumab as infusions every 8 weeks (The first dose will be 300mg followed \n1 week later by 1000 mg and 1000 mg every 8 weeks thereafter for up to 2 years) or  \nArm B:  No treatment (i.e. observation only) \nBlood samples, lymph node examination, spleen and liver measurement, and \nconstitutional symptoms evaluation are performed every 8 weeks throughout the \ntreatment phase.  Follow-up assessments are performed every 3 months for 5 years to \nevaluate survival and disease status. \nA bone marrow examination is required to confirm Complete Remission (CR) at least \n2 months after completion of therapy and when a subject fulfills the International \nWorkshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) updated National Cancer \nInstitute-Sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) requirements for Complete Remission \n(CR) [Hallek, 2008].  Previous results may be used or if not available, a bone marrow \nexam may be done at screening. If a subject\u2019s response improves to a CR while on study, \nthen a bone marrow examination is required to confirm CR at least 2 months after \nresponse as per the updated IWCLL NCI-WG requirements for CR [Hallek, 2008].  \nAdditionally, CT Scans are required at screening, for confirmation of a new CR, yearly \nwhile on study, and at disease progression. \n \nStudy Endpoints/Assessments \nPrimary Endpoint: \n\uf0b7 \nProgression free survival (PFS), defined as the interval from randomization until \ndisease progression or death  \nSecondary Endpoints: \nClinical \n\uf0b7 \nImprovement in response \n\uf0b7 \nTime to next treatment \n\uf0b7 \nOverall survival \n\uf0b7 \nProgression-free survival after next-line therapy \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 14 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n\uf0b7 \nTime to progression after next-line therapy \n\uf0b7 \nChanges in patient reported outcome (PRO) measures \n\uf0b7 \nChanges in patient reported outcome (PRO) scores \n\uf0b7 \nImprovement of ECOG performance status \n\uf0b7 \nB-symptoms/Constitutional symptoms/fatigue \n\uf0b7 \nIncidences of and number of subjects with grade 3 and 4 infections \n\uf0b7 \nIncidence, severity of adverse events, serious adverse events and other safety \nparameters \n\uf0b7 \nEvaluation of myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) \n\uf0b7 \nFrequency of transfusions \n\uf0b7 \nIncidence of Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia  (AIHA)   \n\uf0b7 \nHuman Anti Human Antibodies (HAHA) \n\uf0b7 \nIgG, IgA, IgM serum levels \nDisease markers \n\uf0b7 \nMinimal Residual Disease (MRD) \n\uf0b7 \nB-cell monitoring \n\uf0b7 \nPrognostic markers correlating with clinical response:  \n\uf0b7 \nCytogenetics by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) \n\uf0b7 \nIgVH mutational status \n\uf0b7 \n\uf0622 microglobulin \n\uf0b7 \nChanges in complement levels \n \nPharmacokinetics \n\uf0b7 \nPlasma ofatumumab concentrations \nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   ",

        "Title": "INTRODUCTION",
        "Content": " 1.1. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL or B-CLL) is a chronic leukemia in which peripheral, clonal B-cells progressively accumulate. The disease is a hematological neoplasm of unknown etiology, characterized by monomorphic small, round B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes that aberrantly co-express T-cell (CD5+) and B-cell (CD19+, CD23+) cell surface markers, with a low expression of CD20.  Over the past decade, new information suggests B-CLL originates from antigen-stimulated mature B-lymphocytes, which either avoid cell death through the effect of external signals, or die by apoptosis, but are replenished by proliferating precursor cells [Chiorazz, 2005]. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia is the most common type of leukemia in the western world, accounting for 40% of all leukemia types in individuals over the age of 65  [Oscier, 2004].  It is estimated that in the US alone 15,110 adults (8,750 men and 6,360 women) will be diagnosed and 4,390 adults will die of CLL in 2008 [Jemal, 2008]. CLL follows a variable clinical course with overall survival times ranging from months to decades.  Median survival from diagnosis is approximately 10 years in the overall CLL population, but is only 18 months for patients with advanced disease [Nabhan, 2004]; and to 9-13 months for CLL cases refractory to fludarabine [Byrd, 2004].  Traditional clinical staging systems devised by Rai and Binet are the simplest and still best validated means of assessing prognosis for CLL patients [Rai, 1975; Binet, 1981], however, there is substantial heterogeneity in the course of the disease within defined stages. In recent years molecular and cellular markers have been correlated with disease aggressiveness.  These allow further stratification of subjects into risk groups such as: abnormal cytogenetics, CD38, ZAP-70, beta-2-microglobulin, IgVH mutational status [Oscier, 2004; Abbott, 2006; Shanafelt, 2007; Zenz, 2007].  So far, unfortunately these parameters have only limited use in determining when and what type of therapy to use [Binet, 2006].  One exception is that p53 deletion was shown to predict for non-response to purine analogues like fludarabine and for poor clinical outcome, but is not predictive for response to a particular therapy [Dohner, 1995]. The prevalence of CLL increases with age and the median age at the time of diagnosis is 65 to 70 years [Redaelli, 2004].  Approximately 50% of patients are initially asymptomatic and are observed for several years before treatment is needed, therefore more than half of patients who finally require therapy are older than 70 years. 1.2. Current Treatment for CLL Over the last two decades, the treatment goal of CLL has undergone a paradigm shift changing from simple symptom palliation to attainment of maximal disease control and consequently prolonged survival [Tam, 2007].  A first generation of clinical trials assessing single agent chemotherapy was followed by a second generation of trials investigating combination chemotherapies which showed no significant difference in overall survival [Shanafelt, 2007]. Subjects receiving monotherapy or combination Novartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 16 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nchemotherapy experience a range of different levels of toxicity, with the more aggressive \ntherapies being also more toxic and choice of therapy has to be performed as a risk based \napproach [Abbott, 2006].  Currently, FCR seems to be the most potent regimen, both in \npreviously untreated and relapsed patients [Hallek, 2008; Tam 2008].  In general, as with \nmost clinical studies, all these trials endorse strict eligibility criteria often excluding \nsubjects older than 65 plus those with inferior organ function. This causes a limitation in \nassessing the suitability of these studied therapy regimen regarding their efficacy and \ntolerability for the treatment of unselected patients in practice of which the majority is \nolder and in poor health. \nDespite numerous studies with various therapies demonstrating overall and complete \nresponse rates in both previously untreated and relapsed or refractory CLL patients \n[Hallek, 2001; Huhn, 2001; O'Brien, 2001a; O'Brien, 2001b; Keating, 2002; \nWierda, 2005], there is no curative treatment and the disease is marked by relentless \nrelapse.  There is no current maintenance therapy to prolong the time between relapses \nimproving the overall quality of life or to improve overall survival.    \nThe biological behavior of CLL is similar to follicular lymphoma (FL), wherein the \ndisease is incurable and the clinical course is characterized by a high relapse rate.  After \nrelapse, both the response rate and progression-free survival after subsequent salvage \nregimens steadily decrease [Montoto, 2002].  Recently, in relapsed FL patients, \nmaintenance treatment with the chimeric CD20 mAb, rituximab, resulted in a median \nPFS of 51.5 months versus 14.9 months with observation only (p<.001).  Significantly \nimproved PFS was noted regardless of induction treatment (CHOP vs R-CHOP).  \nAdditionally, rituximab maintenance also improved overall survival at 3 years (85% vs \n77%, p=.011) [van Oers, 2006].  Similar results of improved PFS and overall survival \nwith rituximab maintenance in FL patients have been noted [Forstpointner, 2006; \nHochster, 2009]. \nWhile rituximab monotherapy is not very effective in previously untreated or relapsed \nCLL patients, possibly due to the relatively low CD20 expression on CLL cells \n[Byrd, 2001], a recent small phase II study with rituximab consolidation and maintenance \ntreatment showed a significantly longer response duration in patients with minimal \nresidual disease (MRD)-positive CLL in first remission after fludarabine induction  \n[Del Poeta, 2008]. \n1.3. \nOfatumumab \nOfatumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb), IgG1\u03ba, targeting a unique \nepitope on the CD20 molecule expressed on human B-cells, resulting in increased \nbinding affinity to CD20, prolonged dissociation rate, and increased cell kill due to \ngreater CDC activity and similar ADCC activity, especially in low CD20 expressing cells \n[Teeling, 2006].  Thus, depletion of B-cells by ofatumumab treatment may provide \nclinical benefits to subjects with CD20-expressing cell tumors. In B-CLL, the goal of \ntreatment is to achieve complete abnormal B-cell depletion in the blood and to induce an \nobjective tumor response in the lymph nodes.   \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 17 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nIn a Phase I dose-ranging trial of ofatumumab 500mg (n=3), 1000mg (n=3), or 2000mg \n(n=27) given weekly x 4, 50% PR was observed in the 2000mg dose amongst relapsed \nCLL patients [Coiffier, 2008].  Objective response significantly correlated with \nmaximum observed concentration (Cmax), minimum observed concentration (Cmin), \narea under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and half-life (t\u00bd) and survival endpoints \ncorrelated with exposure.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached and \ntreatment was well tolerated.  Adverse events were limited to grade 1-2 infusion reactions \nand easily managed with premedication. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in only 6% of \npatients.  Non-opportunistic grade 1-2 infections were observed in 51% of patients. \nInterim analysis for the pivotal trial evaluated 154 patients with refractory CLL (Study \nHx-CD20-406).  In the 138 evaluable patients, approximately half (59) were refractory to \nboth fludarabine and alemtuzumab and the other patients were refractory to fludarabine \nand considered inappropriate for alemtuzumab due to bulky disease of the lymph nodes.  \nAn objective response rate of approximately 50% consisting of 30 partial responses was \nachieved in the fludarabine and alemtuzumab refractory group and an objective response \nrate of approximately 44% was achieved in the fludarabine refractory group including 1 \ncomplete response and 34 partial responses.  In this study, ofatumumab was generally \nwell tolerated by the patients.  The most frequently reported adverse events (>15% \nfrequency) were pyrexia, diarrhea, fatigue, cough, neutropenia, anemia and pneumonia.  \nThere were no unexpected safety findings. \nStudies clearly indicate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) play an important role in the \ntreatment of CLL.  Anti-CD20 mAbs with a low toxicity can be applied advantageously \nin subjects who cannot tolerate highly toxic treatments (i.e. advanced age), in \ncombination with chemotherapy and as maintenance treatment.  Ofatumumab preclinical \ndata demonstrates superior CDC activity in CLL compared to rituximab.  Based on this, it \nis suggested that ofatumumab\u2019s stronger B-cell depletion potential may translate into \nlonger duration of treatment response.   \n1.4. \nRationale \nThe purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of ofatumumab maintenance treatment \nin subjects in remission from relapsed CLL based upon: \n1) the similarities in biological behavior between CLL and FL;  \n2) in relapsed FL, maintenance treatment with anti-CD20 MAb, rituximab is the standard \nof care;  \n3) results in a phase II study with rituximab induction and maintenance resulted in \nprolongation of PFS in MRD positive CLL in first remission after fludarabine; \n4) ofatumumab has higher in vitro activity against CLL cells; and  \n5) ofatumumab has also demonstrated efficacy in refractory CLL as monotherapy (Study \nHx-CD20-406).  \n1.5. \nRationale for Closing Enrollment \nAt the start of the study, it was expected that the study would fully enroll prior to the \nIDMC review at 2/3 of the events.  When the required number of events occurred prior to \nfully enrolling the study, but with the full number of evaluable subjects available, and \nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   before the results were known, it was decided that if the primary endpoint met the predefined significance level of p<0.001, demonstrating clinical benefit for the ofatumumab arm, further enrollment would be discontinued.  The independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) communicated that the significance level of p<0.001 for the primary endpoint at the interim analysis had been met.  Additionally, the study had obtained the number of evaluable subjects required (the number of evaluable subjects at the time of the interim analysis was 479, with 478 evaluable required).  The conduct of the study will continue without modification, with continuation of the assessments of the efficacy and safety endpoints and no change in study design, in accordance with the IDMC recommendation.  Currently, the standard of care is still observation, so that those subjects on the observation arm are receiving the standard of care and are not being jeopardized by continuation of observation.  The recommendation of the IDMC was that subjects should continue in their assigned study arms without change in treatment. Additionally, the IDMC did not identify any safety concerns associated with long-term treatment with ofatumumab. ",

All examinations must be performed \u2264 14 days prior to dosing, with the exception of the CT scan and bone marrow examination, which can be performed \u2264 6 weeks prior to dosing.  At the discretion of the physician, rescreening is acceptable.  Refer to Appendix 1 Time and Events for complete list of screening procedures. 3.1.2.

A Health Change \nQuestionnaire will be administered for completion by the subjects at all post baseline \nvisits, as per Section 6.5.6. \n3.1.4. \nFollow-up Phase \nSurvival and disease status assessments (physical examination and evaluation of \nperipheral blood samples) will be performed post treatment every 3 months for 5 years \nafter last treatment. \nA bone marrow examination is required to confirm Complete Remission (CR) at least \n2 months after completion of therapy and when a subject fulfills the International \nWorkshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) updated National Cancer \nInstitute-Sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) requirements for Complete Remission \n(CR) [Hallek, 2008].  Previous results may be used or if not available, a bone marrow \nexam may be done at screening. If a subject\u2019s response improves to a CR while on study, \nthen a bone marrow examination is required to confirm CR at least 2 months after \nresponse as per the updated IWCLL NCI-WG requirements for CR [Hallek, 2008].  \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 21 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nAdditionally, CT Scans are required yearly while on study, including during follow-up, \nand at disease progression, whenever that may occur. \nSubjects demonstrating disease progression will be followed for survival status until \nstudy completion.  Follow-up assessment after disease progression on treatment will \nassess survival status, date of next CLL therapy, type of therapy and response to therapy. \nIt is acceptable for the information for survival follow-up visits to be collected remotely \n(via telephone, email), as necessary.  The frequency of the survival follow-up visits \nshould be per local standard of care, suggested every 3 months for CLL. Minimally, this \nshould be collected at least annually. \nPRO measures (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL16, EQ-5D and a Health Change \nQuestionnaire) will be administered for completion by the subject at follow-up visits, as \nper Section 6.5.6. \nPlease refer to Section 6:  Study Assessments and Procedures for detailed assessment \ninstructions. \nSupplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is \nprovided in the accompanying Study Procedures Manual (SPM). The SPM will provide \nthe site personnel with additional administrative and detailed technical information. \n3.2. \nDiscussion of Design and Dose Rationale \nAs discussed in the rationale, CLL is characterized by relapse and there is currently no \napproved maintenance therapy.  This study will evaluate the use of ofatumumab as \nmaintenance treatment in second/third line CLL.  Subjects will be randomized to receive \neither ofatumumab or no treatment in a 1:1 ratio to provide a direct comparison of \ntreatment versus observation, the current standard of care.  \nThe study does not utilize a placebo and is not blinded as the infusion reactions to \nofatumumab would not maintain the blind.  As the endpoints of the study are objective, \nthis will not affect the interpretation of the study. \nThe design of the study is considered sufficient at 80% power to detect a clinically \nmeaningful difference in maintenance treatment vs no treatment. \nWith the current treatment options, patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy (i.e. FCR) \nhave the longest PFS.  For patients not na\u00efve to rituximab, this PFS represents a median \nof 28 months [Wierda, 2005] and a 40% increase of this PFS would be 39.2 months. \nThe proposed ofatumumab dose and schedule in this study was selected based on several \nconsiderations:  preclinical data with ofatumumab and clinical population \npharmacokinetic modeling and simulation, prior clinical experience with rituximab, and \nprior clinical experience with ofatumumab. \nAn initial dose of 300 mg of ofatumumab is given in Week 1 to minimize infusion-\nrelated events before introducing the higher dose at Week 2 to provide higher \nofatumumab concentrations.   \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 22 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nPreclinical data suggest that ofatumumab plasma concentrations >10 \uf06dg/mL are sufficient \nto suppress peripheral B-cell recovery in cynomolgus monkeys as well as suppress tumor \ncell growth in Daudi tumor-bearing SCID mice [Bleeker, 2008].  Ofatumumab \nconcentrations above 50 \uf06dg/mL were sufficient for complete B-cell depletion.  Recovery \nof CD20+ cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes was detected when plasma \nofatumumab concentrations had dropped below 5-10 \uf06dg/mL.  Thus, a potential clinical \ntarget in developing ofatumumab dosing regimens is prolonged maintenance of plasma \nconcentrations >10 \uf06dg/mL. \nPharmacokinetic data from the Phase I study in 33 patients with relapsed or refractory \nCLL (Study Hx-CD20-402) were analyzed using a two-compartment model with a \ndecrease in clearance after the first dose and assuming a constant rate infusion using a \nnonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach (NONMEM).  Assuming that ofatumumab \npharmacokinetics with maintenance administration in subjects with CLL who have \nresponded to their most recent therapy is similar to that observed with repeated weekly \nofatumumab administration, the resulting model was used to simulate concentration-time \ndata for 500 subjects receiving ofatumumab at 300 mg at Week 1 and 1000 mg at \nWeek 2, followed seven weeks later by 1000 mg every eight weeks for two years.  Based \non these simulations, the probability of maintaining plasma ofatumumab concentrations \n>10 \uf06dg/mL was approximately 75% after the third 1000-mg dose at Week 17, increasing \nover time to approximately 90% during continued maintenance dosing and for 8 weeks \nafter the last dose.  Thus, a dosing schedule, with the first infusion of 300 mg at Week 1 \nand subsequent infusions of 1000 mg at Week 2 and at eight-week intervals starting with \nWeek 9, is expected to achieve prolonged maintenance of plasma concentrations \n>10 \uf06dg/mL in a high proportion of patients with CLL. \nPrior clinical experience with rituximab suggests that prolonged administration schedules \nenhance response duration in patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n[Collins-Burow, 2007; van Oers, 2007].  Various dosing regimens have been examined as \nmaintenance therapy, including administration of single infusions every two months, and \nsafety has been demonstrated for up to two years of maintenance therapy.  Two Phase II \nstudies have examined maintenance therapy with rituximab in patients with CLL, one \nexamining four weekly infusions of 375 mg/m2 every six months for up to two years in \npatients with objective response or stable disease after initial rituximab treatment \n[Hainsworth, 2003] and one examining four monthly infusions of 375 mg/m2 followed by \ntwelve monthly infusions of 150 mg/m2 in patients with CR or PR positive for minimal \nresidual disease after fludarabine/rituximab treatment [Del Poeta, 2008].  These studies \nsuggest that prolonged administration schedules enhance response duration in patients \nwith CLL.  The existing clinical experience with maintenance rituximab suggests that \nadministration of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody should be tolerated for up to two \nyears.   \nPrior clinical experience in a Phase I/II trial of ofatumumab in patients with relapsed or \nrefractory CLL (Study Hx-CD20-402) suggested that a total dose of 6500 mg (weekly \ndoses of 500, 2000, 2000, and 2000 mg) was effective and tolerated [Coiffier, 2008].  In \nthe pivotal trial in patients with refractory CLL (Study Hx-CD20-406), ofatumumab was \ngiven as an initial infusion of 300 mg, followed by seven 2000 mg infusions at weekly \nintervals, followed five weeks later by 2000 mg infusions every four weeks for four \nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   doses.  This initial high-dose/intense regimen followed by monthly high-dose infusions was tolerated, suggesting that 1000 mg ofatumumab every two months for two years should be tolerated.  Adverse events in previous trials had been primarily infusion-related events on the day of the first infusion; therefore, the prolonged treatment schedule in Study OMB112517 is not expected to affect the overall safety profile.

If no infusion reactions occur the infusion rate should be increased every \n30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mL/hr, according to Table 2. If this schedule is \nfollowed, the infusion duration will be approximately 4.5 hours. \nTable 2 \nInfusion rate at 1st Ofatumumab (300 mg) infusion \nTime \nmL/hour \n0 \u2013 30 minutes \n12 \n31 \u2013 60 minutes \n25 \n61 \u2013 90 minutes \n50 \n91 \u2013 120 minutes \n100 \n121 - 150 minutes \n200 \n151 - 180 minutes \n300 \n181+ minutes \n400 \n \nIf an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted. \nUpon restart, the infusion rate should be half of the infusion rate at the time the infusion \nwas paused. If, however, the infusion rate was 12 mL/hr before the pause, the infusion \nshould be restarted at 12 mL/hour.

If a dose delay is \nrequired for ofatumumab, due to but not limited to adverse events, dosing may resume at \nphysician discretion, and if the patient is still considered to be in remission. \n5.1.1.3. \nManagement of Infusion Reactions \n5.1.1.3.1. Mild and Moderate Intensity Adverse Events (Grade 1 and 2) \nIf the investigator judges the AE to be related to the infusion, the infusion may be \ntemporarily slowed or interrupted.  \nWhen the subject\u2019s condition is stable, the infusion can be restarted according to the \njudgment of the investigator.  \nUpon restart, the infusion rate should be half of the infusion rate at the time the infusion \nwas paused. If, however, the infusion rate was 12mL/hr before the pause, the infusion \nshould be restarted at 12mL/hr. \nHereafter, the infusion rate may be increased according to the judgment of the \ninvestigator, in the manner described in Table 2 and Table 3 (i.e. not more than doubled \nand no earlier than every 30 minutes). \nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   5.1.1.3.2. Severe Intensity Adverse Events (Grade \u22653) If the investigator judges a grade \u22653 AE to be related to the infusion, the infusion must be interrupted and the appropriate clinical intervention begun.  When the AE decreases to grade <3, the investigator may restart the infusion.  Upon restarting the infusion, the infusion rate must be 12mL/hr for the first infusion or 25mL/hr for subsequent infusions, and may subsequently be increased according to the judgment of the investigator, as described in Table 2 and Table 3 (i.e. not more than doubled and no earlier than every 30 minutes).  If the severity of the AE does not resolve to grade <3 despite adequate clinical intervention, or the same AE increases to grade =3 on three occasions during one infusion, the subject should be withdrawn from treatment. 5.2. Treatment Assignment Subjects will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule (see Section 3.1.2).  Please refer to the SPM for detailed instruction. 5.3. Product Accountability In accordance with local regulatory requirements, the investigator, designated site staff, or head of the medical institution (where applicable) must document the amount of investigational product dispensed and/or administered to study subjects, the amount returned by study subjects, and the amount received from and returned to Novartis, when applicable.  Product accountability records must be maintained throughout the course of the study. 5.4. Prohibited Concomitant Medication or Therapies \uf0b7 Anti-cancer medication not part of the protocol treatment (e.g. alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, purine analogues, other monoclonal antibodies, and other medications including glucocorticoids) \uf0b7 Any non-marketed drug substance or experimental therapy Note:  Glucocorticoids given for other indications such as exacerbations of asthma or as premedication for ofatumumab infusions are allowed.

Body \nweight (without shoes) will be measured at screening and throughout treatment and \nfollow-up phases and recorded on the eCRF. \n6.1.5. \nPhysical Examination \nA general physical examination is required at the screening visit and at visits during the \nstudy.  This physical will include general appearance including examination of the \nfollowing:  skin, palpation of the lymph nodes, extremities, abdomen including \ndetermination of hepatomegaly, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and \nneurological systems. \n6.1.6. \nElectrocardiogram \nA standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is required at screening.  The investigator \nwill perform an overall interpretation of the ECG or may delegate this task to a \ncardiologist, if applicable.  Additional ECGs may be obtained as clinically warranted at \nthe discretion of the PI or delegate. \n6.1.7. \nVital Signs \nVital signs including temperature, blood pressure (BP), and pulse are documented per \nAppendix 1 Time and Events and during ofatumumab intravenous infusions. \nTemperatures for individual subjects must be measured using the same method at all \nvisits. \n6.1.8. \nConcomitant Medication \nAny medication other than the trial drug is considered concomitant medication (apart \nfrom protocol defined premedication given prior to the infusions of ofatumumab) and \nwill be documented, including the following information: \n\uf0b7 Indication \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 31 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n\uf0b7 Dose information \n\uf0b7 Start date  \n\uf0b7 Stop date of administration or ongoing at study termination \nOf note:  Intravenous gamma globulin, prophylactic antibiotics, and G-CSF may be given \nper local standard of care, at the physician\u2019s discretion.  \n6.1.9. \nECOG Performance Status \nAn Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status value is required \nat screening and throughout treatment and follow-up phases, to evaluate daily living \nabilities.  Please refer to SPM for definitions of the ECOG performance status. \n6.1.10. \nConstitutional Symptoms (B-Symptoms) \nAssessment for the presence of the following symptoms will be performed at screening \nand at each visit:  \n\uf0b7 night sweats without signs of infection \n\uf0b7 unintentional weight loss \uf0b3 10% within the previous 6 months \n\uf0b7 recurrent, unexplained fever of greater than 100.5\uf0b0F for 2 weeks without signs of \ninfection \n\uf0b7 extreme fatigue  \n6.1.11. \nLymph Node and Organ Examination \nA physical lymph node and organ (spleen and liver) examination will be performed at \nscreening and throughout the trial as part of disease status assessment. \nLymph nodes evaluation requires physical exam recording the diameter in two planes of \nthe largest palpable node in each of the following sites: cervical, axillary, supraclavicular, \ninguinal and femoral.  Lymphadenopathy is defined as lymph nodes with the largest \ndiameter greater than 1.5 cm. \nLiver and spleen size is assessed by physical exam and documented as \u2018cm\u2019 under the \ncostal margin.  \n6.1.12. \nPre-treatment Computed Tomography (CT) Scans \nAll subjects must have a CT scan with contrast of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis \nperformed at screening to confirm remission status.  CT scans performed within 6 weeks \nprior to entering the study and collected according to defined standards can be used as \nscreening CT scans.

A pathologist at a central laboratory will evaluate the biopsy and smear.  Details \nregarding collection of bone marrow samples are provided in a separate procedure \nmanual. \n6.2. \nEfficacy \n6.2.1. \nDefinition of Response \nWhile subjects will be entering the study in remission, changes in status to disease \nprogression or even from PR to CR will be determined according to the definitions of \nresponse in the IWCLL updated NCI-WG guidelines [Hallek, 2008] and documented at \nvisits outlined in the time and events table.  For a tabular summary of all criteria of \nresponse definition in CLL patients see Appendix 2.  The IWCLL updated NCI-WG \nguidelines should be applied in the context of clinical judgment and determination of \ndisease progression is at the physician\u2019s discretion. \n6.2.1.1. \nComplete Remission (CR) \nCR requires all of the following criteria as assessed at least 2 months after therapy or at \nthe earliest 2 months after beginning this maintenance protocol (i.e. ofatumumab \ntreatment/observation): \nPeripheral blood lymphocytes (evaluated by blood and differential count) below 4x109 \n(4000/\u00b5L) \nAbsence of significant lymphadenopathy (e.g. lymph nodes > 1.5 cm diameter). \nNo hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. \nAbsence of constitutional symptoms \nBlood counts above the following values: \na. \nNeutrophils > 1.5 x 109/L* \nb. Platelets > 100 x 109/L* \nc. \nHemoglobin > 11.0 g/dL (6.8mmol/L)** \n*without need for exogenous growth factors \n**without red blood cell transfusion or need for exogenous erythropoietin \n \nBone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed at least 2 months after the \nfinal treatment and if clinical and laboratory results listed above in Section 6.2.1.1 \n(items 1 to 5) demonstrated that a CR has been achieved. The marrow sample should \nbe analyzed by flow cytometry to demonstrate that the marrow is free of clonal CLL \ncells.  Cases with residual CLL cells by conventional flow cytometry are defined as \nPR.  \nTo define a CR, the marrow sample must be at least normocellular for age, with less \nthan 30% of nucleated cells being lymphocytes.  Lymphoid nodules should be \nabsent.  If lymphoid nodules can be found, immunohistochemistry analysis should be \nperformed to assess if nodules are comprised primarily of T-cells or lymphocytes \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 33 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nother than CLL cells or of CLL cells.  If marrow is hypocellular, repeat after 4-6 \nweeks, provided the blood counts have recovered (as defined in Section 6.2.1.1 item \n5).  Marrow biopsies should be compared with any pretreatment marrow.  In some \ncases, it is necessary to postpone the marrow biopsy until after all other criteria to \ndefine a CR have been satisfied, however, this time interval should not exceed 6 \nmonths after treatment. \nSubjects who fulfill all the preceding criteria for CR (Section 6.2.1.1 items 1 to 6) but \nhave persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, apparently unrelated to CLL \nbut related to drug toxicity, should be considered as CR with incomplete bone marrow \nrecovery.  \n6.2.1.2. \nPartial Remission (PR) \nPR is defined by the criteria described in Section 6.2.1.2 items 1, 2, and /or 3 (if abnormal \nprior to therapy), as well as one or more of the features listed in item 4. To define a PR at \nleast one of these parameters needs to be documented for a minimal duration of 2 months.  \nConstitutional symptoms persisting for more than 1 month should also be documented. \n1. A decrease in the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes by 50% or more from \nthe value prior to therapy  \n2. Reduction in lymphadenopathy as defined by: \n\uf0b7 \nA decreased lymph node size by below 50% or more either in the sum product \nof up to 6 lymph nodes or in the largest diameter one of the enlarged lymph \nnode(s) detected prior to therapy \n\uf0b7 \nNo increase in any lymph node and no new lymph nodes. In small lymph nodes \n(<2cm), an increase of <25% is not considered to be significant \n3. A decrease in the noted pre treatment enlargement of liver or spleen by 50% or more \n4. The blood count should show at least one of the following results: \n\uf0b7 \nNeutrophils more than 1.5 x 109/L (1500/\u00b5L) *  \n\uf0b7 \nPlatelet counts greater than 100 x 109/L (100,000/\u00b5L) or 50% improvement over \nbaseline* \n\uf0b7 \nHemoglobin greater than 110g/L (11.0g/dL, 6.8mmol/L) or 50% improvement \nover baseline ** \n*without need for exogenous growth factors \n** without red blood cell transfusion or need for exogenous erythropoietin. \n6.2.1.3. \nProgressive Disease (PD) \nPD during or after therapy is characterized by at least one of the following: \n1. Lymphadenopathy. Progression of lymphadenopathy, if one of the following is \nobserved: \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 34 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n\uf0b7 \nAppearance of new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (>1.5cm), \nsplenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates \n\uf0b7 \nAn increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any previous \nsite.  \nAn increase by 50% or more in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen or \nde novo appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly \nAn increase by 50% or more in the numbers of blood lymphocytes with at least \n5000 B-lymphocytes per microliter (5.0 x 109/L). \nTransformation to a more aggressive histology (e.g. Richter\u2019s transformation). \nOccurrence of cytopenia (neutropenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia) attributable to CLL \n\uf0b7 \nDuring therapy: Cytopenias cannot be used to define disease progression \n\uf0b7 \nAfter treatment: The progression of any cytopenia (unrelated to autoimmune \ncytopenia), as documented by a decrease of Hb levels by more than 20g/L \n(2 g/dL) or to less than 100g/L (10g/dL), or by a decrease of platelet counts by \nmore than 50% or to less than 100 x 109/L (100.000/\u03bcL), which occurs at least \n3 months after treatment, defines disease progression, if the marrow biopsy \ndemonstrates an infiltrate of clonal CLL cells. \n \nNote:  Physician\u2019s discretion should be used to distinguish between potential \ninfection versus progressive disease base on lymphocyte count.  It is acceptable \nto defer definitive judgment of progressive disease until further evidence is \navailable. \n6.2.2. \nBone Marrow Examination \nUnilateral bone marrow aspirate smear and a suitable bone marrow biopsy will be \nperformed at baseline (or within 6 weeks prior to entering the study) ONLY as part of the \nCR evaluation for patients entering or during the study in CR. A pathologist at a central \nlaboratory will evaluate the biopsy and smear.  Details regarding collection of bone \nmarrow samples are provided in a separate procedure manual.  \nBone marrow examination (aspirate smear and biopsy) to confirm CR, as determined by \nthe clinical and laboratory results listed in Section 6.2.1.1 is required at least 2 months \nafter completion of therapy or at least 2 months of therapy or response while on study. \nThe marrow should be analyzed by flow cytometry to confirm absence of clonal CLL \ncells.  Samples are to be reviewed in conjunction with any prior pathology, as available. \nMinimal residual disease assessment will also be performed on bone marrow aspirate \nobtained after CR (see Section 6.2.3). When possible, the first drop from bone marrow \naspirate will be used for MRD measurement. \n6.2.3. \nMinimal Residual Disease (MRD) \nFor subjects enrolling in the study who are in CR, baseline MRD will be assessed at \nscreening, prior to any treatment visit. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 35 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nFor subjects who improve to a CR while on study, a bone marrow examination will be \nperformed after at least 2 months of therapy or response while on study. \nThe bone marrow sample if available, and/or peripheral blood sample will be examined \nby flow cytometry with the following B-CLL MRD panel [Rawston, 2007]: \n\uf0b7 \nCD5/CD19 with CD20/CD38 \n\uf0b7 \nCD5/CD19 with CD81/CD22 \n\uf0b7 \nCD5/CD19 with CD79b/CD43 \nIn addition CD3/CD19 with CD14/CD45 analysis is performed to allow enumeration of \nCD19+ cells and contamination assessment and CD5/CD19 with Ig\u03bb/Ig\u03ba analysis is \nperformed to confirm clonality.  \nSubjects with negative MRD will receive follow-up MRD assessments of the peripheral \nblood until MRD analysis becomes positive.  \nThe absence of MRD is defined as less than one B-CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes. \n6.2.4. \nCT-Scans \nAccording to the IWCLL updated NCI-WG response criteria for CLL [Hallek, 2008], \nCT-scans are recommended in clinical trials to assess response.  This study will \nprospectively explore the validity of CT scans for a more sensitive detection of disease \nprogression.  CT-Scans are required prior to start of therapy.  CT scans will be done \napproximately yearly while on study including at the end of treatment/observation, and/or \nupon relapse.  If a scheduled CT scan indicates disease progression, and the subject will \nbe withdrawn, it is not necessary to repeat a CT scan for a withdrawal visit.  The actual \nCT scan (not just the radiologist report) should be available and performed to the criteria \nspecified in the SPM. \n6.3. \nLaboratory Assessments \nAll the analyses will be performed by a central laboratory, except for the direct \nantiglobulin test (Coomb\u2019s test) that will be performed locally.  A detailed description of \nthe procedures for sampling, handling, storage, and shipment of the laboratory samples \nand all material such as test tubes and labels is provided in the SPM or by the central \nlaboratory. \nThe protocol should be followed as closely as possible, but if as per local practice, a \nblood draw for hematology analysis prior to the visit date is required, it would be \nacceptable for hematology analysis, but the blood draw can be taken no more than 3 days \nahead of the visit date.  Blood draws performed by local laboratories (e.g. for quicker \npre-dose response assessment) of protocol required lab assessments are acceptable, \nhowever, it is important that the sample for the central laboratory analysis is taken at the \nsame time.  The local laboratory results of absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet \ncount, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and hemoglobin must also be entered into the \neCRF, if these results are used to manage a treatment decision.  Central laboratory \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 36 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \ninformation will also be entered into the eCRF.  Safety assessments, such as hematology \nnot specified in the protocol, are allowed between visits, per investigator discretion and \nlocal practice. \n6.3.1. \nFlow Cytometry for B-CLL Diagnosis/Confirmation of Phenotype \nand B-cell Monitoring \n6.3.1.1. \nB-CLL Diagnosis/Phenotype Confirmation \nThe B-CLL immunophenotype will be assessed by analysis of surface expression of: \nCD5, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD76b, and surface Ig at screening, if possible and at relapse.  \nIf the subject is in CR, results prior to latest response may be used, if available. \n6.3.1.2. \nB-Cell Monitoring \nB-cell monitoring (CD5+CD19+ and CD5-CD19+) will be performed every two months \nand at every follow-up visit until values return to normal levels on two consecutive \ndeterminations. \n6.3.2. \nPeripheral Blood Sampling for Hematology and Biochemistry \nBlood samples will be drawn for analysis of the following parameters at visits according \nto the time and events schedule: \n\uf0b7 \nHematology: hemoglobin,  hematocrit, reticulocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and  \nwhite blood cell differential (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes \nand monocytes, prolymphocytes - all expressed in % and in absolute numbers)  \n\uf0b7 \nBiochemistry:  sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase \n(ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), \nlactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH),  albumin, glucose (random). Haptoglobin will \nbe analyzed at screening and 3 months after last treatment.   \n6.3.3. \nPrognostic Factors \nWhole blood will be collected at the baseline visit, if possible, and/or upon relapse for \nlater analysis of the following prognostic factors: \n\uf0b7 IgVH mutational status  \n\uf0b7 VH3-21 usage \n\uf0b7 Cytogenetics (by FISH) including but not limited to; 6q-, 11q-, +12q, 17p-, 13q-  \n\uf0b7 \u03b22 microglobulin   \nAnalysis of these factors are performed in batches by a central laboratory.  Details for \nprocedures and shipments are provided separately. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 37 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n6.3.4. \nPeripheral Blood Sampling for Safety and Disease Status \nThe following laboratory tests will be performed: \n\uf0b7 Direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) at screening and 3 months after last \ntreatment. \n\uf0b7 Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) at screening. \nFor subjects that are HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive and HBV DNA negative \n(see Section 4.3) blood samples will be collected for HBV DNA testing every \n2 months during the treatment/observation and during follow-up at the 3 months \nand 6 months visit. \n\uf0b7 Screening pregnancy test (HCG) for women of childbearing potential, unless \nthey have had a hysterectomy, have undergone tubal ligation within one year \nbefore the screening visit, or have been postmenopausal for at least one year. \n\uf0b7 Human Anti-Human Antibody (HAHA) prior to first dose of ofatumumab, every \n6 months during ofatumumab treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post treatment \n(i.e. predose Visit 1, at Months 7, 13, 19, and 25 during treatment and at 3 and \n6 months after last ofatumumab dose, regardless of when it occurs).  A HAHA \nsample (and a pharmacokinetic sample) should also be obtained at the last \ntreatment visit if it does not occur at a scheduled sampling time (e.g., if \ntreatment is discontinued early).  HAHA samples will only be collected for \nsubjects randomized to ofatumumab. \n\uf0b7 Complement: CH50 at baseline and after last treatment visit.  \n\uf0b7 IgA, IgG and IgM at screening, every 6 months during treatment, and after last \ntreatment visit and/or upon relapse.  In case of infection, these immunoglobulins \nmay be tested at the physician\u2019s discretion.  Additional samples may be collected \npost last treatment (such as 3 and 6 months f/u), if warranted. \n6.4. \nSafety Assessments \n6.4.1. \nLiver chemistry stopping and follow-up criteria \nAccording to Novartis policy across all compounds, liver chemistry stopping and \nfollow-up criteria have been designed to assure subject safety and evaluate liver event \netiology.  (Refer to Appendix 5) \n6.4.1.1. \nLiver Chemistry Stopping Criteria \n1. ALT > 3xULN and bilirubin \uf0b3 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin; bilirubin \nfractionation required*) \n2. ALT > 8xULN \n3. ALT \uf0b3 5xULN for more than 2 weeks \n*NOTE: serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available.

Is life-threatening \nNOTE:  The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in \nwhich the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an \nevent, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. \nc. \nRequires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization \nNOTE:  In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained \n(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for \nobservation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician\u2019s \noffice or out-patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are \nAEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, \nthe event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether \u201chospitalization\u201d occurred or was \nnecessary, the AE should be considered serious. \nHospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen \nfrom baseline is not considered an AE. \nAn overnight hospital stay due to slow infusion rates will not be considered a Serious \nAdverse Event.  \nd. Results in disability/incapacity, or \nNOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person\u2019s ability to \nconduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences \nof relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 42 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \ninterfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial \ndisruption. \ne. \nIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect \nf. \nMedical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is \nappropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be \nimmediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize \nthe subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the \nother outcomes listed in the above definition.  These should also be considered \nserious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive \ntreatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood \ndyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of \ndrug dependency or drug abuse. \n6.4.5. \nToxicity Assessment of AEs and SAEs \nThe investigator is required to make an assessment of the toxicity grade of each AE or \nSAE reported.  In this protocol, the maximum toxicity grade of each non-hematologic \nAE/SAEs will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common \nToxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (please refer to the SPM for \ndetails).   \nIt is important to consider low blood counts at the initiation of therapy when evaluating \nhematologic toxicity of CLL subjects.  Due to this, standard solid tumor toxicity criteria \ncannot be used or subjects would exhibit grade II to IV toxicity at study onset.  For this \nreason, hematologic toxicity (platelets, hemoglobin and neutrophils) of each AE/SAE \nwill be evaluated according to an adaptation of the IWCLL Grading Scale for \nHematological Toxicity in CLL Studies [Hallek, 2008]. \nTable 4 \nGrading scale for Hematological Toxicity \nGrade1 \nDecrease in Platelets2 or Hb3 (nadir) from \npretreatment value (%) \nAbsolute Neutrophil Count/\uf06dL4 (nadir) \n1 \n11%-24% \n\uf0b31500 and <2000 \n2 \n25%-49% \n\uf0b31000 and <1500 \n3 \n50%-74% \n  \uf0b3500 and <1000 \n4 \n\uf0b375% \n  <500 \n1. Grades: 1-mild; 2-moderate; 3-severe; 4-life-threatening; 5-fatal. Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any level \nof decrease from pretreatment will be recorded as grade 5. \n2. Platelet counts must be below normal levels for grades 1-4.  If, at any level of decrease the platelet count is \n<20,000/\u03bcL, this will be considered grade 4 toxicity, unless a severe or life threatening decrease in the initial \nplatelet count (e.g., 20,000/\u03bcL) was present pretreatment, in which case the subject is not evaluable for toxicity \nreferable to platelet counts. \n3. Hb levels must be below normal levels for grades 1-4. Baseline and subsequent Hb determinations must be \nperformed before any given transfusions. The use of erythropoietin is irrelevant for the grading of toxicity, but \nshould be documented. \n4. If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches less than 1,000/\u03bcL, it should be judged to be grade 3 toxicity. \nOther decreases in the white blood cell count, or in circulating granulocytes, are not to be considered, since a \ndecrease in the white blood cell count is a desired therapeutic endpoint. A gradual decrease in granulocytes is not \na reliable index in CLL for stepwise grading of toxicity. If the ANC was less than 1,000/\u03bcL prior to therapy, the \nsubject is not evaluable for toxicity referable to the ANC. The use of G-CSF is irrelevant for the grading of toxicity, \nbut should be documented. \n \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 43 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n6.4.6. \nLaboratory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities Reported \nas AEs and SAEs \nAny abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or \nother safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, vital signs measurements), including those that \nworsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific \njudgement of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. \nHowever, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the \nunderlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for \nthe subject\u2019s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs. \nB cell depletion, IgG below LLN, low CD19+ count, and hypogammaglobulinemia due \nto treatment with ofatumumab are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs. \nInfusion related AEs may lead to a prolonged infusion time. Overnight stay at the \nhospital due to slow infusion rate is not to be reported as a SAE. \nSpecific attention will be paid to monitor events of special interest such as infusion \nreactions, tumor lysis syndrome, infections and progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML).  Please refer to the SPM and/or the following text*. \nHandling Infusion Reactions: \nInfusion reactions are commonly associated with anti-CD20 antibody therapy. \nOfatumumab can cause serious infusion reactions manifesting as bronchospasm, dyspnea, \nlaryngeal edema, pulmonary edema, flushing, hypertension, hypotension, syncope, \ncardiac ischemia/infarction, back pain, abdominal pain, pyrexia, rash, urticaria, and \nangioedema. Infusion reactions occur more frequently with the first 2 infusions. \nThe site staff must be prepared to intervene if an infusion reaction occurs. Special caution \nshould be taken during the first infusion for each subject and during the infusion for any \nsubject who did not tolerate a previous infusion well.  It is recommended that a crash cart \nis readily accessible in the event of an emergency. Infusion reactions should be treated \naccording to the investigators judgment and best clinical practice.   \nInterruption, restart and increasing the rate of the infusion depending on the severity of \nthe AE must be according to the description below and at the investigator\u2019s discretion. \nAn increase of the infusion rate after an interruption must not exceed the scheduled \namount as described in Table 2 and Table 3 (i.e. not more than doubled rate and no \nearlier than every 30 minutes).  See Section 5.1.1.3 for details on management related to \nintensity of adverse events. \nHandling Tumor Lysis Syndrome: \n \nMonitoring and treatment of potential Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) should be \nperformed as per oncology standard of care.  \n \nSymptoms of TLS include: \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 44 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n\uf0b7 \nHyperkalemia, potentially leading to cardiac conduction abnormalities, muscle \nweakness or paralysis \n\uf0b7 \nHyperphosphatemia, potentially leading to renal failure \n\uf0b7 \nHypocalcemia. Symptoms include (but are not limited to):  tetany, seizures, mental \nretardation / dementia, parkinsonian (extrapyramidal) movement disorders, \npapilledema, emotional instability / agitation / anxiety, myopathy \n\uf0b7 \nHyperuricemia, potentially leading to renal failure \n \nRisk factors for TLS include a high tumor burden, high concentrations of circulating cells \n(\u2265 25,000/mm3), hypovolemia, renal insufficiency, elevated pre-treatment uric acid \nlevels and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Thus TLS should be suspected in \nsubjects with large tumor burden who develop acute renal failure along with \nhyperuricemia (> 15 mg/dL) or hyperphosphatemia (> 8 mg/dL). Acute uric acid \nnephropathy is associated with little or no urine output. The urinalysis may show uric \nacid crystals or amorphous urates. The hypersecretion of uric acid can be detected with a \nhigh urine uric acid:creatinine ratio > 1.0, compared to a value of 0.6-0.7 for most other \ncauses of acute renal failure. \n \nIn those patients considered to be at risk for TLS, management includes correction of \nelectrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function, maintenance of fluid balance \n(consider aggressive hydration i.e. ~3,000 ml/m2/day fluid administered parenterally)  \nand supportive care. If signs of TLS occur, the investigator can administer rasburicase or \nallopurinol (e.g. Zyloprim, Allohexal, Allosig, Progout, Zyloric) or other drugs used to \ntreat hyperuricemia, per prescribing information, if deemed appropriate.  \n \nHandling Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): \n \nPML is a viral-induced demyelinating disease of the central nervous system usually \noccurring in the immunocompromised individual and has been reported with \nofatumumab. JC virus (JCV) infection resulting in PML and death has been reported in \nrituximab-treated subjects with hematologic malignancies or with systemic lupus \nerythematosus, an indication for which rituximab has not been approved. Investigators \nand nurses should pay careful attention for signs and symptoms consistent with a \ndiagnosis of PML. Signs and symptoms of PML include visual disturbances, ocular \nmovements, ataxia, and changes in mental status such as disorientation or confusion. \nThese symptoms are not an exhaustive list, and the investigator should exercise judgment \nin deciding to report signs and symptoms to sponsor promptly. \n \nIf a subject develops neurological signs or symptoms consistent with PML, treatment \nshould be halted and the subject referred to a neurologist for evaluation. At a minimum, \nblood JCV PCR and/or MRI should be performed; if either test is positive, Cerebrospinal \nFluid (CSF) JCV PCR should be performed. If blood JCV PCR and MRI are negative, \nthe investigator should contact the Sponsor for appropriate action to be taken. If blood \nJCV PCR and/or MRI are positive, the subject should be withdrawn from treatment, \nproceed to the Follow-Up Period, and be followed until resolution. There are no known \ntests that can reliably determine who is at increased risk for developing PML. There are \nno known interventions that can reliably prevent PML or adequately treat PML if it \noccurs. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 45 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n \nThe investigator will do the following when reporting a serious infection (including \nPML) or sign/symptom consistent with PML. \n \n\uf0b7 Refer to Section 6.4.10 of this document for further information and detailed \nguidance for completing and transmitting these and other SAE reports for subjects \nwho experience a serious infection, malignancy, death, or sign or symptom of \nPML. \n\uf0b7 Provide key source documentation for the Sponsor to assist with the safety \nevaluation process. \nExamples of key source documents include but are not limited to: hospitalization records, \ndischarge summaries, laboratory evaluations, biopsy results, culture/sensitivity results, \ndeath certificates, and autopsy reports. \nIf the subject has not otherwise been withdrawn from the study, then the investigator \nshould contact the Sponsor to discuss the appropriate course of action regarding study \ncontinuation. \nMonitoring of Hepatitis in patients: \nFor subjects who are HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive and HBV DNA negative, blood \nsamples will be collected for HBV DNA testing every 2 months during the \ntreatment/observation period and during follow-up at the 3 months and 6 months post last \ndose visits.  \nFor subjects who require hepatitis monitoring, extra visits outside those defined in the \nprotocol may be required. \n6.4.7. \nDisease-Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not \nQualifying as SAEs \nAn event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease \nprogression) does not need to be reported as an SAE.  However, if the progression of the \nunderlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expected for the subject, \nor if the investigator considers that there was a causal relationship between treatment \nwith investigational product or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression, \nthen this must be reported as an SAE.   \n6.4.8. \nTime Period and Frequency of Detecting AEs and SAEs \nAll SAEs and AEs regardless of relationship to investigational product will be collected \nfrom the first dose of investigational product to 60 days after the last dose of \ninvestigational product and will be documented on the eCRF.  All SAEs and AEs for \nsubjects not receiving treatment (observation) will be collected for the same duration of \ntime (i.e. Visit 1 until 60 days after last visit, up Visit 14).  Only SAEs will be reported \nfrom 60 days after the last dose of investigational product or last treatment/observation \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 46 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nvisit to the end of the follow-up period. All SAEs regardless of causality will be collected \nuntil the end of the follow-up period.   \nSubject who are HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive and HBV DNA negative may be \nincluded in the study but must undergo HBV DNA monitoring.  Consult with a physician \nexperienced in care and management of subjects with hepatitis B to manage/treat subjects \nwho are anti-HBC positive.  Anti-viral therapy should be initiated, if required.  If a \nsubject\u2019s HBV DNA becomes positive during the study, the Novartis medical lead should \nbe notified.  The risks and benefits of continuing ofatumumab or discontinuing \nofatumumab should be discussed with the medical lead before appropriate treatment \ndecisions are made for that individual subject. \nFrom the time a subject consents to participate in and completes the study (See \nSection 4.4), all SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., \nprotocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) will be \nreported promptly to Novartis. \nAny pre-existing condition or signs and symptoms present prior to investigational \nproduct will be recorded as medical history.   \nAny SAE brought to the investigator\u2019s attention after the subject has completed the study \nand considered by the investigator as possibly related to investigational product must be \nreported to Novartis. \n6.4.9. \nPregnancy \nAny pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported using a clinical \ntrial pregnancy form.  To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to \nNovartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The pregnancy must be followed \nup to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and \nchild.  Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be \nreported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE. \nAny SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator\u2019s \nattention after the subject has completed the study and considered by the investigator as \npossibly related to the investigational product, must be promptly reported to Novartis. \nIn addition, the investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female \npartners of male study subjects who become pregnant while the subject is enrolled in the \nstudy. Pregnancy information must be reported to Novartis as described above. \n6.4.10. \nPrompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Other Events \nto Novartis \nSAEs and pregnancies meeting the pre-defined criteria will be reported promptly to \nNovartis as described in the following table once the investigator determines that the \nevent meets the protocol definition for that event. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 47 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n \nInitial Reports \nFollow-up Information on a \nPrevious Report \nType of Event \nTime Frame \nDocuments \nTime Frame \nDocuments \nAll SAEs \n24 hours \n\u201cSAE\u201d data \ncollection tool \n24 hours \nUpdated \u201cSAE\u201d \ndata collection tool \nPregnancy \n24 hours \nPregnancy Form \n2 Weeks \nUpdated \nPregnancy Form \n \nThe method of detecting, recording, evaluating and follow-up of AEs and SAEs plus \nprocedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to Novartis are provided in the \nSPM.

All PRO questionnaires are \nincluded in Appendix 3: Patient Reported Outcome Measures. \n6.5.1. \nEuropean Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer \nQuality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) \nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed for use in a wide range of oncology clinical trial \npopulations and is intended to be supplemented by tumor specific modules \n[Aaronson, 1993; Osoba, 1994]. The 30 items of the EORTC QLQ-C30 are scored in the \nfollowing domains: Physical Functioning (5 items), Role Functioning (2 items), \nEmotional Functioning (4 items), Cognitive Functioning (2 items), Social Functioning (2 \nitems), Pain (2 items), Fatigue (3 items), Nausea and Vomiting (2 items).  There are also \nfive single item symptom scores (Insomnia, Loss of Appetite, Constipation, Diarrhoea, \nand Dyspnoea), a single item asking about Financial Difficulties and a global health \nstatus/quality of life domain consisting of two items.  Thus the EORTC-QLQ-C30 \nprovides a measure of symptom and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) domains \nfrom the perspective of the subject.   \nSubjects respond to the items on a four point Likert scale ranging from 1 \u2018Not at all\u2019 to 4 \n\u2018Very much\u2019 and it takes approximately 11 minutes to complete.    Subjects are asked to \nthink back over the past week when responding to the items. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is \nself-administered and has been widely used in various oncology populations.  It is \navailable in over 50 languages and higher scores indicate better HRQL.  The EORTC \nQLQ-C30 is widely used and has been well validated in a number of different cancer \nindications.  The QLQ-C30 has been used in several recent studies with B-CLL patients \n[Catovsky, 2007; Doorduijn, 2005; Holzner, 2004].   \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 48 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n6.5.2. \nEuropean Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer \nQuality of Life Questionnaire Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 16 \nitem module (EORTC QLQ-CLL 16) \nThe EORTC QLQ-CLL16 EORTC QLQ-CLL 16] has been developed to the high \nstandards of rigour required by the EORTC group, but its psychometric properties are as \nyet untested.  The first three phases of the EORTC development process have been \ncompleted for the CLL16 module including generation of items based on literature \nreview and semi-structured interviews with specialists and patients; review of the draft \nitems by professionals and 3-5 patients; and pre-testing of the module for acceptability \nand relevance through cognitive debriefing in a sample of patients.  Subjects respond to \nthe items on a four point Likert scale ranging from 1 \u2018Not at all\u2019 to 4 \u2018Very much\u2019 and it \nis estimated to take less than ten minutes to complete.  Subjects are asked to think back \nover the past week when responding to 12 of the items and the past four weeks for the \nremaining four items which are all included in the hypothesized Infection domain.  \nHypothesized scoring for the QLQ-CLL16 module has been recommended but thus far \nhas not been validated.   QLQ-CLL16 domain scores will also be developed based upon \nthe recommendations of the authors and, again, psychometric validation of these domains \nwill be described in the detailed psychometric validation statistical analysis plan.  \n6.5.3. \nEuroQoL Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) \nThe EQ-5D is a self-administered, generic, indirect utility measure \n[EuroQoL Group, 1990]. The EQ-5D consists of a 0-100 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) \non which subjects are asked to rate their current overall health status and five single-item \ndimensions which ask subjects to rate their health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual \nactivities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.  The five single items can be summed \nand expressed as a single global index of health-related quality of life. For each of the \nfive items patients must choose between three levels of difficulty in accomplishing tasks \nin that dimension.  The VAS is then used in combination with the dimension scores to \ngenerate a patient profile. \nOne response exists per dimension, such that: \n\uf0b7 \nLevel 1 (no problem) is coded as \u201c1\u201d \n\uf0b7 \nLevel 2 (some or moderate problems) is coded as \u201c2\u201d \n\uf0b7 \nLevel 3 (unable, or extreme problems) is coded as \u201c3\u201d \nThe health states are described in terms of five-digit numbers based on the answers to \neach of the five questions.  The states can then be converted to a single score using a \ntable that contains health utility values for the 243 different possible health states.  Thus a \nhealth utility score is created that can be incorporated into analyses of cost effectiveness.  \nAdditionally, a three-digit number between 0 and 100 is read off the VAS, from the exact \npoint where the subject has marked the scale.   The EQ-5D takes less than five minutes to \ncomplete.  The EQ-5D was recently used in a study of B-CLL patients [Doorduijn, 2005]. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 49 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n6.5.4. \nPatient Reported Constitutional Symptoms (\u2018B-Symptoms\u2019) score \nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CLL16 module include items asking about symptoms \ndue to B-CLL and other problems commonly associated with B-CLL or its treatment, \nsuch as increased risk of infections.  To provide a clear indication of the change in \nconstitutional or \u2018B\u2019-symptoms, an additional scoring approach will be evaluated based \non items that reflect \u2018B-symptoms\u2019 from the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-CLL16 module, \nnamely, need to rest (C30 item 10), felt weak (C30 item 12), tired (C30 item 18), weight \nloss (CLL item 31), temperature changes (CLL item 35), night sweats (CLL item 36) and \nskin problems such as itching (CLL item 37) lethargic (CLL item 39), slowed down \n(CLL item 40). This score is proposed to provide patient reported data that might be \nsupportive of the \u2018B-symptoms\u2019 clinician rating.  The validity and reliability of this \u2018B-\nsymptoms\u2019 score will be assessed through psychometric validation using blinded data \nfrom this trial, as summarised in the psychometric validation RAP.   \n6.5.5. \nHealth Change Questionnaire \nThe Health Change Questionnaire consists of a single question in which the subject is \nasked if he/she has experienced any change in his/her health overall since beginning the \nstudy.  The Health Change Questionnaire should be administered at all post-baseline \nvisits at which PRO measures are administered.  It is included for the purpose of \nvalidating the PRO measures (in particular the QLQ-CLL16 measure which has not been \npreviously validated). \n6.5.6. \nAdministration of PRO Measures \nThe EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL16, and EQ-5D should be administered at \nbaseline and at each treatment clinic visits; beginning with Visit 3, and at each follow-up \nvisit post treatment; every 3 months through Month 60.  The Health Change \nQuestionnaire should be administered at all the aforementioned post-baseline visits.  If a \nsubject demonstrates disease progression, the measures should be completed at the \nprogression visit and again one time after determination of progression.  If a subject in \nPD will be available and willing, post-PD questionnaires may be administered through \nthe date that would correspond to the subject\u2019s Month 60 visit.  If a subject withdraws \nfrom the study then the PRO questionnaires should be administered at the point of \nwithdrawal.   \n6.6. \nPharmacokinetics \nBlood samples will be collected from subjects receiving ofatumumab predose and 0.5 h \nafter the end of the infusion (EOI) at treatment on Month 1 Week1 (Day 1), Month 1 \nWeek 2 (Day 8), Months 3, 7, 13, 19 and 25.  In addition, predose samples will be \ncollected prior to ofatumumab administration on Months 5 and 9.  A pharmacokinetic \nsample (and a HAHA sample) should also be obtained at the last treatment visit if it does \nnot occur at a scheduled sampling time (e.g., if treatment is discontinued early). Samples \nwill also be collected at any time of day during clinic visits at 3 and 6 months post-last \nofatumumab dose.  Table 5 provides the pharmacokinetic sample collection schedule.   \nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 50 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   Predose samples may be collected at any time prior to dosing, and 0.5 h post-EOI samples may be collected within a \uf0b1  15 minute window around the scheduled time.

        "Content": " 8.1. Hypotheses The primary endpoint for this study is progression-free-survival (PFS).  The null and alternative hypotheses are designed with the goal of demonstrating the superiority of ofatumumab maintenance treatment over no further treatment after remission induction in subjects with relapsed chronic CLL.  The following hypotheses will be evaluated: H0:  Distribution of the progression-free survival events for the ofatumumab maintenance treatment and for the no further treatment groups are the same (Hazard ratio is equal to 1) H1:  Distribution of the progression-free survival events for the ofatumumab maintenance treatment and for the no further treatment groups are not the same (Hazard ratio is not equal to 1) 8.2. Study Design Considerations 8.2.1. Sample Size Assumptions The primary objective of this study is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) of ofatumumab maintenance treatment vs. no further treatment after remission induction in patients with relapsed CLL as determined by investigator assessment based on NCI-WG CLL criteria [Hallek, 2008].  The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint, PFS, using the following assumptions: \uf0b7 Exponential survival curves where the ratio of the hazard rates is constant over time \uf0b7 Median PFS for the no further treatment group is 28 months \uf0b7 Median PFS for the ofatumumab maintenance treatment group is 39.2 months \uf0b7 A 1:1  stratified randomization scheme \uf0b7 A 5% two-sided risk of erroneously claiming a difference in the presence of no true underlying difference (alpha level) \uf0b7 An 80% chance of successfully declaring a difference in the presence of a true underlying difference (power) \uf0b7 Accrual rate of 12 subjects per month \uf0b7 Stratified Log-rank test for hypothesis testing  Using the above assumptions, approximately 280 total events from both treatment arms are needed for the study to attain 80% power.  With a total sample size of 478 evaluable subjects, the total duration of the study will be approximately 63.5 months in order to obtain the 280 total events.  Assuming a drop out rate of 10%, the total sample size for Novartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 52 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nboth arms combined will be about 532 and the total duration of the study will be \napproximately 68 months \n8.2.2. \nSample Size Sensitivity \nThe robustness and sensitivity of the above sample size calculation is considered in order \nto assess the impact on power should the assumed median PFS vary in the ofatumumab \nmaintenance group.  The following Table 6 shows the estimated power for different \nmedian values of PFS for the ofatumumab maintenance group.  The total number of \nevents is 280, and the total number of evaluable subjects is 478. \nTable 6 \nEstimated Power for Differing Median Values of PFS \nMedian PFS (months) for \nOfatumumab Maintenance \nMedian PFS (months) for No \nFurther Treatment \nEstimated Power \n35 \n28 \n0.47 \n36.4 \n28 \n0.60 \n39.2 \n28 \n0.80 \n42 \n28 \n0.92 \n \n8.2.3. \nSample Size Re-estimation \nSample size re-estimation will not be performed for this study. \n8.3. \nData Analysis Considerations \n8.3.1. \nAnalysis Populations \n8.3.1.1. \nPopulations defined for the analyses \n1)  Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:  This population will include subjects who are \nrandomized in this study.  This will be the primary population used for evaluation of the \nefficacy data for all efficacy assessments.  In the analyses, subjects will be grouped based \non how they are randomized regardless of which treatment they receive.  The ITT \npopulation will also be used for all PRO analyses. \n2)  Safety Population:  This population will include all randomized subjects.  This \npopulation will be used for evaluation of all safety measurements.  In the analyses, \nsubjects will be grouped based on the treatment they received regardless of how they are \nrandomized.   \n3)  Per Protocol (PP) Population:  This population will exclude subjects with major \nprotocol deviations that will impact the efficacy outcome.  The Per Protocol Population \nwill be used in the primary endpoint analysis to check the robustness of the result when \nusing the ITT population.  However, if the number of subjects in the PP population is \n10% or smaller than the ITT population, then the analysis will not be performed.  \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 53 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n4)  Pharmacokinetic Population:   This population will consist of all subjects in the ITT \npopulation for whom a pharmacokinetic sample is obtained and analyzed. \n8.3.2. \nAnalysis Data Sets \nThe primary data set for efficacy will be based on the response assessments.  The primary \ndata sets for safety will based on the adverse events and the laboratory data. \nThe responses will be assessed by the investigators and changes in response will be \ndetermined according to the IWCLL updated NCI-WG CLL criteria [Hallek, 2008].   \n8.3.3. \nTreatment Comparisons \n8.3.3.1. \nPrimary Comparisons of Interest \nThe primary treatment comparison of interest will be ofatumumab maintenance treatment \nvs. no further treatment.  The primary comparison will be based on progression-free \nsurvival (PFS) when the total number of events reaches 280 in the ITT population. \n8.3.3.2. \nSecondary and Other Comparisons of Interest \nThe primary efficacy endpoint will serve as a gatekeeper for the interpretation of \ntreatment comparisons for the \u2018inferential\u2019 secondary endpoints.  If H0 is rejected at the \n0.001 significance level at the planned interim analysis (see Section 8.3.4) or at the \n0.0498 significance level at the final analysis, the conclusion will be that there is a \ntreatment difference between ofatumumab maintenance treatment and no further \ntreatment, and the p-values for the \u2018inferential\u2019 secondary endpoints may be interpreted \nand tested at the 0.05 significance level for the final analysis. If H0 is not rejected at the \ninterim or final analysis, the conclusion will be that there is no difference between \nofatumumab maintenance treatment and the no further treatment arm, and all other \np-values will be used for descriptive \n purposes only. \nThe following endpoints are considered as \u2018inferential secondary endpoints\u2019 and will be \ntested and compared between the ofatumumab maintenance treatment and the no further \ntreatment group only if the primary endpoint, PFS, is significant. \n1. Time to next CLL therapy \n2. Overall survival \nThe control for multiplicity across the \u2018inferential secondary endpoints\u2019, test of H0 will be \nperformed in a sequential manner to control the type I error at 0.05 as follows: \n1- Time to next CLL Therapy \n2- Overall survival \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 54 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nFor the primary efficacy endpoint and the inferential secondary endpoints, any p-values \nfor the comparison of ofatumumab maintenance treatment vs no further treatment that \nachieve statistical significance under multiplicity adjustment will be identified in the \nstudy report as inferentially significant for confirmatory purposes. \nAny other comparisons of interest will between the ofatumumab maintenance treatment \nand no further treatment arms for other secondary endpoints will be done at an alpha \nequals to 0.05.  No multiplicity will be considered in the other secondary endpoints and \nany p-value that is \u22640.05 will be identified as nominally significant \n8.3.4. \nInterim Analysis \nTwo interim analyses will be performed.  The first interim will assess safety endpoints.  \nThe second interim will be done to assess efficacy based on the primary endpoint, and it \nwill also evaluate safety. \nAn independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be convened to perform an \ninterim analysis of the safety data after 100 subjects in the maintenance arm have been on \ntreatment for at least 6 months.  Details of the interim analysis for safety will be given in \nthe IDMC Charter. \nAn interim analysis of the primary endpoint, PFS, will be performed when 2/3 of the total \nnumber of events have occurred (187 events).  The interim analysis for PFS will be \nperformed by an IDMC utilizing a conservative significance level of 0.001.  Performing \nthis interim analysis with an IDMC applying conservative statistical criteria would allow \nfor an earlier detection of clinical benefit to patients with ofatumumab maintenance and if \nthis analysis is positive, may support a submission that enables earlier access to patients. \nEnrollment was expected to be completed at the time of this analysis.  \n \nHowever, when the required number of events occurred prior to fully enrolling the study, \nbut with the full number of evaluable subjects available, and before the results were \nknown, it was decided that if the primary endpoint met the predefined significance level \nof p<0.001, demonstrating clinical benefit for the ofatumumab arm, further enrollment \nwould be discontinued.  \nThe study conduct will continue regardless of the outcome of the interim analysis of the \nprimary endpoint.  This interim analysis will also evaluate safety.  The interim analysis of \nthe primary endpoint, PFS, will be conducted as described in Section 8.3.5.1, and further \ndetails of the interim analysis will be provided in the IDMC Charter.  The final analysis \nwill be conducted at a significance level of 0.0498. \n8.3.5. \nKey Elements of Analysis Plan \nThe final analysis will take place when the total number of events is reached in the study.  \nAn event is defined as when a subject has disease progression (PD) or death due to any \ncause during the study.  All available data will be analyzed and the results will be \npresented in a report.  Released data that are available from later visits will also be \nincluded. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 55 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nWithdrawal \nSubjects will be treated until disease progression or withdrawal from study treatment due \nto unacceptable adverse event(s), consent withdrawal or other reasons.  All data up to \ntime of withdrawal will be included in the analysis.   \nSubjects who are withdrawn prematurely from study treatment, but who are not \nwithdrawn from the study at the time of analysis, will be included in the analysis, \nregardless of treatment duration.   \nMissing Data \nSince the period of follow-up for any subject will be dependent on efficacy and toxicity, \nthe duration of follow-up will vary among subjects.  Consequently, there will be no \nimputation for missing data, with the exception of objective response.  Treated subjects \nwho do not have any response data will be assumed to be non-responders.  Further details \nwill be given in the Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP). \nDerived and Transformed Data \nThe evaluation of progression-free-survival will be determined by investigator \nassessment of response according to the IWCLL updated NCI-WG CLL criteria \n[Hallek, 2008].  \nOther Issues \nData from all participating centers will be pooled for the analyses.  It is anticipated that \nsubject accrual will be spread thinly across centers.  Therefore, summaries of data by \ncenter would probably not be informative and will not be provided. \n8.3.5.1. \nEfficacy Analyses \nPrimary Analysis \nThe primary endpoint is progression-free-survival which is defined as the time from \nrandomization to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause.  The \ninvestigator assessment of response will be assessed according to the IWCLL updated \nNCI-WG CLL criteria [Hallek, 2008].  \nAn interim analysis of the primary endpoint, PFS, will be performed when 2/3 of the total \nnumber of events have occurred (187 events).  The interim analysis for PFS will be \nperformed by an IDMC utilizing a significance level of 0.001.   The interim analysis of \nPFS will be conducted in the same manner as described for the final analysis, and further \ndetails of the interim analysis will be provided in the IDMC Charter.   \nThe final analysis of PFS will be tested based on a two-sided test with a significance level \nof 0.0498.  The survival distributions will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival \ncurves and will be compared using a stratified log-rank test. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 56 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nIn addition to the stratified log-rank test based on the Kaplan-Meier procedure, a Cox \nregression model will be used and will include covariates for treatment, stratification \nfactors, and other baseline data deemed appropriate.  Analytical results will include the \nestimated hazard ratios along with 95% confidence intervals, and associated probabilities \nfor the effect of treatment, stratification factors and the covariates.  The hazard ratio for \ntreatment will express the risk of experiencing disease progression or death for \n\u2018ofatumumab\u2019 vs \u2018no further treatment\u2019.  \nTable 7 \nPFS Assignment \nSituation \nDate of Progression or \nCensoring \nOutcome \nNo baseline tumour \nRandomization \nCensored \nProgression documented \nbetween scheduled visits \n- Date of assessment of new \nlymph node (if progression is \nbased on new lymph node) \n- Date of last assessment (if \nprogression is based on \nincrease in sum of measured \nlymph nodes) \nProgressed \nNo progression (at end of trial) \nDate of last assessment of \nmeasured lymph nodes \nCensored \nTreatment discontinuation for \nundocumented progression \nDate of last assessment of \nmeasured lymph nodes \nCensored \nNew anticancer treatment \nstarted \nDate of last assessment of \nmeasured lymph nodes \nCensored \nDeath before first assessment  \nDate of death \nProgressed \nDeath between adequate \nassessment visits  \nDate of death \nProgressed \nDeath or progression after \nmore than one missed visit \nDate of last assessment of \nmeasured lymph nodes \nCensored \n \nSubgroup analyses will be conducted for PFS for the stratification factors. \nSecondary Analyses \nClinical Benefit: \n\uf0b7 Improvement in response \nImprovement in response will be assessed by calculating the percentage of subjects who \nchange from PR at baseline to CR during the study.  Improvement in response will also \nbe assessed by providing the frequency and percentage of subjects with positive minimal \nresidual disease (MRD).  These rates will be compared between treatment groups with \nthe Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for stratification factors (response, number of \nprior treatments and type of prior treatment). \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 57 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n\uf0b7 Overall survival \nOverall survival is defined as time from randomization to date of death.

The \nproportion of subjects wills positive MRD will be compared between treatment groups \nwith the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for stratification factors (response, \nnumber of prior treatments and type of prior treatment). \n\uf0b7 B-cell monitoring \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 58 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nCD5/CD19 change from baseline will be summarized to assess the treatment effect. The \nnumber and percentage of subjects with complete B-cell depletion will be summarized. \n\uf0b7 Prognostic markers correlating with clinical response \nCox-regression will be used to explore the relationship between PFS and the following \nexplanatory variables:  treatment group, cytogenetics (analyzed by FISH) at baseline, \nIgVH mutational status at baseline, \u03b22 microglobulin at baseline, baseline CD20 and \nbaseline complement level. \n8.3.5.2. \nSafety Analyses \nAn independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be convened to perform an \ninterim analysis of the safety data after 100 subjects in the maintenance arm have been on \ntreatment for at least 6 months. Details of the interim analysis for safety will be given in \nthe IDMC Charter. \nThe safety population will be used for the safety analyses.  For continuous variables, the \nmean, median, standard deviation (std), minimum, and maximum will be provided in the \nsummary tables.  For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage will be provided \nin the summary tables. \nExtent of Exposure \nExtent of exposure will be provided by summarizing the number of doses received by \neach subject and the duration of each infusion. \nAdverse Events \nAdverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory \nActivities (MedDRA) dictionary, and grouped by system organ class.   \nEvents will be summarized by frequency and proportion of subjects by system organ \nclass and preferred terms. \nIf the AE is listed in the IWCLL Grading Scale for Hematological Toxicity in CLL \nStudies [Hallek, 2008] or NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) tables, the maximum grade will be \nsummarized. \nThe incidence of AEs, severity of AE, deaths and the primary cause of death will also be \nprovided.  \nThe incidence of subjects with grade 3, 4, and 5 infections will also be provided at each \nvisit. \nThe number and percentage of subjects with Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) \nwill be calculated. \nClinical Laboratory Evaluations \nHematology and clinical chemistry data will be summarized at each scheduled visit \naccording to IWCLL Grading Scale for Hematological Toxicity in CLL Studies \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 59 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n[Hallek, 2008] and NCI CTCAE version 4.0.  The proportion of subjects with values \noutside the reference range will also be presented.   \nThe change in HAHA titers from predose to post-baseline visits and the number and the \nproportion of positive and negative results at each visit will be provided in the \nofatumumab arm only.  A listing of HAHA results and associated ofatumumab plasma \nconcentration at each timepoint will be generated.   \n8.3.5.3. \nPRO Analyses \nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EQ-5D will be scored as per the developers instructions, \nwith scores created for each pre-specified domain.  For the EORTC QLQ-CLL16, the \ndevelopers have proposed a scoring, but it has not been validated yet. Therefore this \nscoring will be validated using the blinded data from the present trial.   \nIn addition to the developer\u2019s hypothesized domains for both EORTC instruments it is \nalso proposed that a \u2018B-symptoms\u2019 score will be created including the following items \nfrom the two instruments: need to rest (C30 item 10), felt weak (C30 item 12), tired (C30 \nitem 18), weight loss (CLL item 31), temperature changes (CLL item 35), night sweats \n(CLL item 36), and skin problems such as itching (CLL item 37), lethargic (CLL item \n39), slowed down (CLL item 40). This score is proposed to provide patient reported data \nthat might be supportive of the constitutional symptoms assessment by the clinician.   \nDetails of the scoring methods of all PRO measures will be provided in the RAP.  Each \nPRO domain will be summarized for each treatment group and the total PRO sample at \neach time point will be presented in tabular format as mean, standard deviation, median, \nminimum, and maximum.  Methods for imputation of missing data will be detailed in the \nRAP.   \nAt each post-baseline timepoint, changes in PRO scores will be calculated by subtracting \nthe baseline score from the score at the subsequent timepoint. Appropriate statistical tests \nwill be proposed in the RAP to evaluate the significance of the change in scores over \ntime, and to compare the scores between treatment arms.  \nStandard psychometric validation analyses will be performed for all PRO measures \n(EORTC QLQ C30, EORTC QLQ CLL16, \u2018B-Symptoms score\u2019, and EQ-5D).  For the \nEORTC QLQ-CLL16 and B-Symptoms score, estimation of minimal clinically important \ndifferences will also be explored.  Details of the methods for all of these psychometric \nvalidation analyses will be provided in the psychometric validation RAP. \n8.3.5.4. \nPharmacokinetic Analyses \nThe plasma concentrations for individual subjects will be determined using validated \nanalytical methods for ofatumumab.  Plasma ofatumumab concentration-time data will be \nsummarized and displayed in tabular and graphical form.  Individual plasma \nconcentrations of ofatumumab will be listed.   \nPopulation pharmacokinetic modeling, using non-linear mixed effects modeling will be \nperformed using validated software such as the computer program NONMEM, if data \nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   permit.  Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for analysis.  The aims of this modeling approach are to:   a.) Define the structural pharmacokinetic model that characterizes the population time course of plasma levels of ofatumumab in this patient population b.) Describe between-subject variability for pharmacokinetic parameter estimates c.) Estimate intra-subject variability on predicted concentrations.  If possible, the effects of patient characteristics (such as gender, weight, height, disease status, etc.) will be investigated in order to account for potential sources of inter-individual variability in systemic exposure.  If there are sufficient data for analysis, the details of the population pharmacokinetic analyses will be provided in a reporting and analysis plan.       ",

Novartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 61 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nWritten informed consent must be obtained from each subject prior to participation in the \nstudy. \n9.2. \nQuality Control (Study Monitoring) \nIn accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and Novartis procedures, Novartis \nmonitors will contact the site prior to the start of the study to review with the site staff the \nprotocol, study requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy regulatory, ethical, and \nNovartis requirements.  When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will \ninclude identification, agreement and documentation of data items for which the CRF \nwill serve as the source document. \nNovartis will monitor the study to ensure that the: \n\uf0b7 \nData are authentic, accurate, and complete. \n\uf0b7 \nSafety and rights of subjects are being protected. \n\uf0b7 \nStudy is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other \nstudy agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. \nThe investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to \nallow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents. \n9.3. \nQuality Assurance \nTo ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, Novartis \nmay conduct a quality assurance audit of the site records, and the regulatory agencies \nmay conduct a regulatory inspection at any time during or after completion of the study. \nIn the event of an audit or inspection, the investigator (and institution) must agree to grant \nthe auditor(s) and inspector(s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate their \ntime and the time of their staff to discuss any findings/relevant issues. \n9.4. \nStudy and Site Closure \nUpon completion or termination of the study, the Novartis monitor will conduct site \nclosure activities with the investigator or site staff (as appropriate), in accordance with \napplicable regulations, GCP, and Novartis Standard Operating Procedures. \nNovartis reserves the right to temporarily suspend or terminate the study at any time for \nreasons including (but not limited to) safety issues, ethical issues, or severe \nnon-compliance.  If Novartis determine that such action is required, Novartis will discuss \nthe reasons for taking such action with the investigator or head of the medical institution \n(where applicable).  When feasible, Novartis will provide advance notice to the \ninvestigator or head of the medical institution of the impending action. \nIf a study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, Novartis will promptly inform \nall investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where applicable),and/or institutions \nconducting the study.  Novartis will also promptly inform the relevant regulatory \nauthorities of the suspension/termination along with the reasons for such action.  Where \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 62 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nrequired by applicable regulations, the investigator or head of the medical institution \nmust inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the reason(s) for the \nsuspension/termination. \n9.5. \nRecords Retention \nFollowing closure of the study, the investigator or head of the medical institution (where \napplicable) must maintain all site study records (except for those required by local \nregulations to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and secure location.  The records must \nbe easily accessible when needed (e.g., for a Novartis audit or regulatory inspection) and \nmust be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting \nsystems, and relevant site staff. \nWhere permitted by local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of the \nrecords may be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, \nelectronic); however, caution must be exercised before such action is taken.  The \ninvestigator must ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate \ncopy of the original.  In addition, they must meet accessibility and retrieval standards, \nincluding regeneration of a hard copy, if required.  The investigator must also ensure that \nan acceptable back-up of the reproductions exists and that there is an acceptable quality \ncontrol procedure in place for creating the reproductions. \nEssential documents (written and electronic) should be retained for a period of not less \nthan fifteen (15) years from the completion of the Clinical Trial unless the Sponsor \nprovides written permission to dispose of them or, requires their retention for an \nadditional period of time because of applicable laws, regulations and/or guidelines. \nThe investigator must notify Novartis of any changes in the archival arrangements, \nincluding, but not limited to archival of records at an off-site facility or transfer of \nownership of the records in the event that the investigator is no longer associated with the \nsite. \n9.6. \nProvision of Study Results and Information to Investigators \nThe database results will be provided to \n for the purposes of independent \nanalysis for publication purposes in a peer reviewed journal.  Where required by \napplicable regulatory requirements, an investigator signatory will be identified for the \napproval of the clinical study report.  The investigator will be provided reasonable access \nto statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the opportunity to review \nthe complete study results at a Novartis site or other mutually-agreeable location. \nUpon completion of the clinical study report, Novartis will ensure public disclosure of the \nclinical trial research results via the Novartis Clinical Trial Results website \n(www.novartisclinicaltrials.com) according to the Novartis SOP and will provide the \ninvestigator with the full summary of the study results.  The investigator is encouraged to \nshare the summary results with the study subjects, as appropriate. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 63 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \n9.7. \nIndependent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) \nAn IDMC will be utilized in this study to ensure external objective medical and/or \nstatistical review of safety and/or efficacy issues in order to protect the ethical and safety \ninterests of subjects and to protect the scientific validity of the study.  The schedule of \nany planned interim analysis and the analysis plan for IDMC review is described in the \ncharter, which is available upon request. \nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   ",

Previous results may be used or if not available, a bone marrow \nexam may be done at screening. If a subject\u2019s response improves to a CR while on \nstudy, then a bone marrow examination is required to confirm CR at least 2 months \nafter response as per the updated IWCLL NCI-WG requirements for CR  \n[Hallek, 2008].  Additionally, CT Scans are required at screening, for confirmation of a \nnew CR, and partial remission (PR) and yearly while on study, and at disease \nprogression. \n \nRationale:  Clarified for a maintenance study. \nSection 1.4  \nRationale \n5) \nrelapased refractory \n \nRationale:  correction \nSection 3.1 \nStudy Design \nReworded entry box from \u201cCR or PR within 3 months of max 2 re-induction treatments \nfor relapsed CLL\u201d to \u201cCR or PR within 3 months after relapsed CLL treatment (max \n2 prior tx)\u201d \n \nRationale:  To clarify remission after last treatment for relapsed CLL \nSection 3.1.3 Treatment Phase \nand then every 3 months  \n \nRationale:  Redundant information provided in Section 3.1.4 Follow-up Phase  \nSection 4.2 \nInclusion Criteria \n2.

General  (07-Feb.-2013) from Amendment 2 (dated 21-MAY-2010) \uf0b7 Specific details on how to handle the time period and frequency of detecting AEs and SAEs such as infusion reactions, Tumor Lysis Syndrome, Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathyand Hepatitis described in Section 6.4.8 of the protocol. Amendment Details Section 6.4.6 Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities Reported as AEs and SAEs Specific attention will be paid to monitor events of special interest such as infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, infections and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).  Please refer to the SPM and/or the following text*. Handling Infusion Reactions:  Infusion reactions are commonly associated with anti-CD20 antibody therapy. Ofatumumab can cause serious infusion reactions manifesting as bronchospasm, dyspnea, laryngeal edema, pulmonary edema, flushing, hypertension, hypotension, syncope, cardiac ischemia/infarction, back pain, abdominal pain, pyrexia, rash, urticaria, and angioedema. Infusion reactions occur more frequently with the first 2 infusions.  The site staff must be prepared to intervene if an infusion reaction occurs. Special caution should be taken during the first infusion for each subject and during the infusion for any subject who did not tolerate a previous infusion well.  It is recommended that a crash cart is readily accessible in the event of an emergency. Infusion reactions should be treated according to the investigators judgment and best clinical practice.    Interruption, restart and increasing the rate of the infusion depending on the severity of the AE must be according to the description below and at the investigator\u2019s discretion. An increase of the infusion rate after an interruption must not exceed the scheduled amount as described in Table 2 and Table 3 (i.e. not more than doubled rate and no earlier than every 30 minutes).  See Section 5.1.1.3 for details on management related to intensity of adverse events. Novartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 99 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nHandling Tumor Lysis Syndrome: \n \nMonitoring and treatment of potential Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) should be \nperformed as per oncology standard of care.  \n \nSymptoms of TLS include: \n\uf0b7 \nHyperkalemia, potentially leading to cardiac conduction abnormalities, muscle \nweakness or paralysis \n\uf0b7 \nHyperphosphatemia, potentially leading to renal failure \n\uf0b7 \nHypocalcemia. Symptoms include (but are not limited to):  tetany, seizures, \nmental retardation / dementia, parkinsonian (extrapyramidal) movement \ndisorders, papilledema, emotional instability / agitation / anxiety, myopathy \n\uf0b7 \nHyperuricemia, potentially leading to renal failure \n \nRisk factors for TLS include a high tumor burden, high concentrations of \ncirculating cells (\u2265 25,000/mm3), hypovolemia, renal insufficiency, elevated pre-\ntreatment uric acid levels and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Thus TLS \nshould be suspected in subjects with large tumor burden who develop acute renal \nfailure along with hyperuricemia (> 15 mg/dL) or hyperphosphatemia (> 8 mg/dL). \nAcute uric acid nephropathy is associated with little or no urine output. The \nurinalysis may show uric acid crystals or amorphous urates. The hypersecretion of \nuric acid can be detected with a high urine uric acid:creatinine ratio > 1.0, \ncompared to a value of 0.6-0.7 for most other causes of acute renal failure. \n \nIn those patients considered to be at risk for TLS, management of TLS includes \ncorrection of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function, maintenance of \nfluid balance (consider aggressive hydration i.e. ~3,000 ml/m2/day fluid \nadministered parenterally) and supportive care. If signs of TLS occur the \ninvestigator can administer rasburicase allopurinol (e.g. Zyloprim, Allohexal, \nAllosig, Progout, Zyloric) or other drugs used to treat hyperuricemia, per \nprescribing information, if deemed appropriate.  \n \nHandling Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): \n \nPML is a viral-induced demyelinating disease of the central nervous system usually \noccurring in the immunocompromised individual and has been reported with \nofatumumab. JC virus (JCV) infection resulting in PML and death has been \nreported in rituximab-treated subjects with hematologic malignancies or with \nsystemic lupus erythematosus, an indication for which rituximab has not been \napproved. Investigators and nurses should pay careful attention for signs and \nsymptoms consistent with a diagnosis of PML. Signs and symptoms of PML include \nvisual disturbances, ocular movements, ataxia, and changes in mental status such as \ndisorientation or confusion. These symptoms are not an exhaustive list, and the \ninvestigator should exercise judgment in deciding to report signs and symptoms to \nsponsor promptly. \n \nIf a subject develops neurological signs or symptoms consistent with PML, \ntreatment should be halted and the subject referred to a neurologist for evaluation. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 100 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nAt a minimum, blood JCV PCR and/or MRI should be performed; if either test is \npositive, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) JCV PCR should be performed. If blood JCV \nPCR and MRI are negative, the investigator should contact the Sponsor for \nappropriate action to be taken. If blood JCV PCR and/or MRI are positive, the \nsubject should be withdrawn from treatment, proceed to the Follow-Up Period, and \nbe followed until resolution. There are no known tests that can reliably determine \nwho is at increased risk for developing PML. There are no known interventions that \ncan reliably prevent PML or adequately treat PML if it occurs. \n \nThe investigator will do the following when reporting a serious infection (including \nPML) or sign/symptom consistent with PML. \n \n\uf0b7 Refer to Section 6.4.10 of this document for further information and detailed \nguidance for completing and transmitting these and other SAE reports for \nsubjects who experience a serious infection, malignancy, death, or sign or \nsymptom of PML. \n\uf0b7 Provide key source documentation for the Sponsor to assist with the safety \nevaluation process. \nExamples of key source documents include but are not limited to: hospitalization \nrecords, discharge summaries, laboratory evaluations, biopsy results, \nculture/sensitivity results, death certificates, and autopsy reports. \nIf the subject has not otherwise been withdrawn from the study, then the \ninvestigator should contact the Sponsor to discuss the appropriate course of action \nregarding study continuation. \nMonitoring of Hepatitis in patients: \n \nFor subjects who are HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive and HBV DNA negative, \nblood samples will be collected for HBV DNA testing every 2 months during the \ntreatment/observation period and during follow-up at the 3 months and 6 months \npost last dose visits.  \nFor subjects who require hepatitis monitoring, extra visits outside those defined in \nthe protocol may be required. \n \nRationale: French regulatory requirement. \n \n \nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 101 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   ",

Blood draws performed by local laboratories (e.g. for \nquicker pre-dose response assessment ) of protocol required lab assessments are \nacceptable, however, it is important that the sample for the central laboratory \nanalysis is taken at the same time.  The local laboratory results of absolute \nneutrophil count (ANC), platelet count, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and \nhemoglobin must also be entered into the eCRF, if these results are used to manage \na treatment decision.

Consult with a \nphysician experienced in care and management of subjects with hepatitis B to \nmanage/treat subjects who are anti-HBC positive.  Anti-viral therapy should be \ninitiated, if required.  If a subject\u2019s HBV DNA becomes positive during the study, \nthe GSK medical monitor should be notified.

As the significance level was met at the interim efficacy analysis, further enrollment in the study will be discontinued.  There will be no changes to the study design, treatment, assessments, or follow-up.  Rationale: Addition to explain stopping enrolment and emphasis that study design will remain the same. Section 1.5 Rationale for Closing Enrollment At the start of the study, it was expected that the study would fully enroll prior to the IDMC review at 2/3 of the events.  When the required number of events occurred prior to fully enrolling the study, but with the full number of evaluable Novartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 105 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nsubjects available, and before the results were known, it was decided that if the \nprimary endpoint met the predefined significance level of p<0.001, demonstrating \nclinical benefit for the ofatumumab arm, further enrollment would be discontinued.  \nThe independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) communicated that the \nsignificance level of p<0.001 for the primary endpoint at the interim analysis had \nbeen met.  Additionally, the study had obtained the number of evaluable subjects \nrequired (the number of evaluable subjects at the time of the interim analysis was \n479, with 478 evaluable required). \n \nThe conduct of the study will continue without modification, with continuation of \nthe assessments of the efficacy and safety endpoints and no change in study design, \nin accordance with the IDMC recommendation.  Currently, the standard of care is \nstill observation, so that those subjects on the observation arm are receiving the \nstandard of care and are not being jeopardized by continuation of observation.  The \nrecommendation of the IDMC was that subjects should continue in their assigned \nstudy arms without change in treatment. Additionally, the IDMC did not identify \nany safety concerns associated with long-term ofatumumab treatment. \nRationale: Addition- due to new information. \nSection 3.1.1. Screening Phase \nBlood samples, physical examination, CT scan and bone marrow examination will be \nperformed to determine the study baseline disease status and study eligibility. \n \nRationale:  Clarification, not all procedures required for study eligibility per se.  \nSection 3.1.3 Treatment Phase \nPatient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL16, \nEQ-5D will be administered for completion by subjects at baseline, and Cycle 4 Day 85, \nat each treatment visit beginning with Visit 3, and end of treatment at last visit, and at \nfollow-up visits. \nRationale: Correction and clarification of study times for PRO administration. \nSection 3.1.4 Follow-up Phase \nAdditionally, CT Scans are required at screening, for confirmation of a new CR, yearly \nwhile on study, including during follow-up, and at disease progression, whenever that \nmay occur. \nRationale:  Clarification of  CT scan requirements for follow-up phase only. \nSection 4.1 Number of Subjects \nThe original plan was for approximately 583 subjects will to be screened (with 532 \nrandomized) to obtain 478 evaluable subjects (assuming 10% screen failure and 10% \ndrop out rates).  All evaluable subjects were obtained, and as the significance level \nwas met at the interim efficacy of analysis, further enrollment will be stopped.  \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 106 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nRationale: Update due to new information. \nSection 6.5.6 Administration of PRO Measures \nThe EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CLL16, and EQ-5D should be administered at \nbaseline and at each treatment clinic visits; Days 1 and 85 beginning with Visit 3, and at \neach follow-up visits post treatment; every 3 months through Month 60.   \nSection 8.3.4 Interim Analysis \nEnrollment was is expected to be completed at the time of this analysis.  \n \nHowever, when the required number of events occurred prior to fully enrolling the \nstudy, but with the full number of evaluable subjects available, and before the \nresults were known, it was decided that if the primary endpoint met the predefined \nsignificance level of p<0.001, demonstrating clinical benefit for the ofatumumab \narm, further enrollment would be discontinued.  \nThe study conduct will continue regardless of the outcome of the interim analysis of the \nprimary endpoint. \nRationale: Change- due to new information. \nSection:  Time and Events Table \n12Only SAEs and associated concomitant medications are to be reported from 60 \ndays after the last dose/observation time. (See Section 6.4.8.) \nRationale: Addition to clarify collection of AEs and concomitant medication during \nfollow-up.\nNovartis CONFIDENTIAL Page 107 Clinical Study Protocol Version 07  Protocol No. OMB112517   ",

Consult with a physician \nexperienced in care and management of subjects with hepatitis B to manage/treat subjects \nwho are anti-HBC positive.  Anti-viral therapy should be initiated, if required.  If a \nsubject\u2019s HBV DNA becomes positive during the study, the GSK medical \nmonitorNovartis medical lead should be notified.  The risks and benefits of continuing \nofatumumab or discontinuing ofatumumab should be discussed with the medical \nmonitormedical lead before appropriate treatment decisions are made for that individual \nsubject. \nFrom the time a subject consents to participate in and completes the study (See \nSection 4.4), all SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol- mandated \nprocedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to GSK concomitant \nmedication, will be reported promptly to GSKNovartis. \nAny pre-existing condition or signs and symptoms present prior to investigational \nproduct will be recorded as medical history.   \nAny SAE brought to the investigator\u2019s attention after the subject has completed the study \nand considered by the investigator as possibly related to investigational product must be \nreported to GSKNovartis. \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 109 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nSection 6.4.9 \nPregnancy \nAny pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported using a clinical \ntrial pregnancy form.  To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to \nGSKNovartis within 2 weeks24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The pregnancy \nmust be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status \nof mother and child.  Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical \nreasons must be reported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as \nan SAE. \nAny SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator\u2019s \nattention after the subject has completed the study and considered by the investigator as \npossibly related to the investigational product, must be promptly reported to \nGSKNovartis. \nIn addition, the investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female \npartners of male study subjects who become pregnant while the subject is enrolled in the \nstudy. Pregnancy information must be reported to GSKNovartis as described above. \nSection 6.4.10 \nPrompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Other \nEvents to GSKNovartis \nSAEs and pregnancies meeting the pre-defined criteria will be reported promptly to \nGSKNovartis as described in the following table once the investigator determines that \nthe event meets the protocol definition for that event. \n \nInitial Reports \nFollow-up Information on a \nPrevious Report \nType of Event \nTime Frame \nDocuments \nTime Frame \nDocuments \nAll SAEs \n24 hours \n\u201cSAE\u201d data \ncollection tool \n24 hours \nUpdated \u201cSAE\u201d \ndata collection tool \nPregnancy \n2 weeks24 \nhours \nPregnancy Form \n2 Weeks \nUpdated \nPregnancy Form \n \nThe method of detecting, recording, evaluating and follow-up of AEs and SAEs plus \nprocedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSKNovartis are provided in \nthe SPM.

Adverse events and \nconcomitant medications terms will be coded using the MedDRA and an internal \nvalidated medicationa custom drug dictionary, GSKDrug.  eCRFs (including queries and \naudit trails) will be retained by GSKNovartis, and copies will be sent to the investigator \nto maintain as the investigator copy.  In all cases, subject initials will not be collected or \ntransmitted to GSK according to GSK policy. \nRationale: Change in study sponsorship and to align with Novartis processes and \nprocedures. \nSection 8.3.5.2 \nSafety Analyses \nAdverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GlaxoSmithKline Medical \nDictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary, and grouped by system organ \nclass.   \nRationale: To align with Novartis processes and procedures. \nSection 9.1 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations, Including the Informed \nConsent Process \nPrior to initiation of a study site, GSKNovartis will obtain approval from the appropriate \nregulatory agency to conduct the study in accordance with applicable country-specific \nregulatory requirements, including those required under a US IND. \nThe study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, \nincluding IND Number 11,719. \nThe study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), all \napplicable subject privacy requirements, and the ethical principles that are outlined in the \nDeclaration of Helsinki 2000, as amended in 2002 and 2004 including, but not limited to: \n\uf0b7 \nInstitutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) review and \napproval of study protocol and any subsequent amendments. \n\uf0b7 \nSubject informed consent. \n\uf0b7 \nInvestigator reporting requirements. \nGSKNovartis will provide full details of the above procedures, either verbally, in \nwriting, or both. \nSection 9.2 Quality Control (Study Monitoring) \nIn accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and GSKNovartis procedures, \nGSKNovartis monitors will contact the site prior to the start of the study to review with \nthe site staff the protocol, study requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy \nregulatory, ethical, and GSKNovartis requirements.  When reviewing data collection \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 111 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nprocedures, the discussion will include identification, agreement and documentation of \ndata items for which the CRF will serve as the source document. \nGSKNovartis will monitor the study to ensure that the: \n\uf0b7 \nData are authentic, accurate, and complete. \n\uf0b7 \nSafety and rights of subjects are being protected. \n\uf0b7 \nStudy is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other \nstudy agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. \nThe investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to \nallow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents. \nSection 9.3 Quality Assurance \nTo ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, \nGSKNovartis may conduct a quality assurance audit of the site records, and the \nregulatory agencies may conduct a regulatory inspection at any time during or after \ncompletion of the study. In the event of an audit or inspection, the investigator (and \ninstitution) must agree to grant the auditor(s) and inspector(s) direct access to all relevant \ndocuments and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to discuss any \nfindings/relevant issues. \nSection 9.4. Study and Site Closure \nUpon completion or termination of the study, the GSKNovartis monitor will conduct site \nclosure activities with the investigator or site staff (as appropriate), in accordance with \napplicable regulations, GCP, and GSKNovartis Standard Operating Procedures. \nGSKNovartis reserves the right to temporarily suspend or terminate the study at any time \nfor reasons including (but not limited to) safety issues, ethical issues, or severe non- \ncompliance.  If GSK determinesNovartis determine that such action is required, \nGSKNovartis will discuss the reasons for taking such action with the investigator or head \nof the medical institution (where applicable).  When feasible, GSKNovartis will provide \nadvance notice to the investigator or head of the medical institution of the impending \naction. \nIf a study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, GSKNovartis will promptly \ninform all investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where applicable),and/or \ninstitutions conducting the study.  GSKNovartis will also promptly inform the relevant \nregulatory authorities of the suspension/termination along with the reasons for such \naction.  Where required by applicable regulations, the investigator or head of the medical \ninstitution must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the reason(s) for the \nsuspension/termination. \nSection 9.5  Records Retention \nFollowing closure of the study, the investigator or head of the medical institution (where \napplicable) must maintain all site study records (except for those required by local \nNovartis \nCONFIDENTIAL \nPage 112 \nClinical Study Protocol Version 07 \n \nProtocol No. OMB112517 \n \n \nregulations to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and secure location.  The records must \nbe easily accessible when needed (e.g., for a GSKNovartis audit or regulatory \ninspection) and must be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the \nfacility, supporting systems, and relevant site staff. \nWhere permitted by local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of the \nrecords may be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, \nelectronic); however, caution must be exercised before such action is taken.  The \ninvestigator must ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate \ncopy of the original.  In addition, they must meet accessibility and retrieval standards, \nincluding regeneration of a hard copy, if required.  The investigator must also ensure that \nan acceptable back-up of the reproductions exists and that there is an acceptable quality \ncontrol procedure in place for creating the reproductions. \nGSK will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining the site records in order \nto comply with all applicable regulatory requirements.  The minimum retention time will \nmeet the strictest standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated by local \nlaws/regulations, GSK standard operating procedures, and/or institutional requirements. \nEssential documents (written and electronic) should be retained for a period of not \nless than fifteen (15) years from the completion of the Clinical Trial unless the \nSponsor provides written permission to dispose of them or, requires their retention \nfor an additional period of time because of applicable laws, regulations and/or \nguidelines. \nThe investigator must notify GSKNovartis of any changes in the archival arrangements, \nincluding, but not limited to archival of records at an off-site facility or transfer of \nownership of the records in the event that the investigator is no longer associated with the \nsite. \nSection 9.6 Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigators \nThe database results will be provided to \n for the purposes of independent \nanalysis for publication purposes in a peer reviewed journal.  Where required by \napplicable regulatory requirements, an investigator signatory will be identified for the \napproval of the clinical study report.  The investigator will be provided reasonable access \nto statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the opportunity to review \nthe complete study results at a GSKNovartis site or other mutually-agreeable location. \nUpon completion of the clinical study report, GSKNovartis will ensure public disclosure \nof the clinical trial research results via the GSKNovartis Clinical Trials RegisterTrial \nResults website (www.novartisclinicaltrials.com) according to the GSKNovartis SOP \nand will provide the investigator with the full summary of the study results.  The \ninvestigator is encouraged to share the summary results with the study subjects, as \nappropriate. \nRationale: Change in study sponsorship and to align with Novartis processes and \nprocedures. \n",
