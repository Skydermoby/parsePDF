The actual timing of the primary analysis will depend on the subject enrollment \n10\nrate, drop-out rate and the rate at which first clinical fractures are observed. When the \n11\nPADCD is reached, all subjects will discontinue IP. \n12\nFollowing the study PADCD, subjects will be followed for DFS, BMFS and OS every 12 \n13\nmonths (Q12M) by clinic visits or telephone contacts starting from their EOT visit until a \n14\nmaximum of either 18 or 66 months after the PADCD, depending on an interim DFS analysis \n15\nafter PADCD (see Section 8). Based on the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)\n16\nrecommendation, given that interim futility analysis of DFS did not indicate futility, it was \n17\ndecided to follow subjects until a maximum of approximately 66 months after PADCD. \n18\nAdditionally, a time-driven analysis for efficacy of the secondary endpoint DFS recommended \n19\nby the DMC will take place approximately 18 months after PADCD, prior to any unblinding of \n20\nsubjects at the investigator/subject level.\n21\nDue to the statistically significant treatment effect in the primary endpoint and fracture-related \n22\nsecondary endpoints between the denosumab arm and the placebo arm, which were \n23\ndemonstrated at the primary analysis (Gnant et al.; Lancet 2015), willing and eligible subjects \n24\nrandomized to placebo during the double-blind phase may participate in an open-label phase \n25\n(OLP) and receive denosumab 60 mg Q6M for up to 36 months (maximum of 7 doses), as \n26\nrecommended by the DMC. Subjects who do not fulfil the eligibility criteria or do not consent \n27\nwill complete LTFU assessments only.\n28\n",

Model fit will be assessed by residual analysis and other diagnostic \n3\nstatistics. In case of heteroscedasticity, appropriate transformations will be performed to \n4\nassess sensitivity to this violation of the model assumption.\n5\nAdditional investigatory analyses of covariates will be conducted.\n6\n7\nIncidence of new vertebral fractures at Month 36\n8\nThe presence or absence of a new vertebral fracture (morphometric vertebral fractures \n9\nidentified from on study x-rays and clinical vertebral fractures confirmed by x-rays) will be \n10\nnoted at 36 months (over a 36 month evaluation period) and classified according to Genant \n11\nsemi-quantitative grades. \n12\nThere are 2 situations where Genant semi-quantitative grades can be missing:  either a spine \n13\nradiograph is not taken or individual vertebrae on a radiograph are not evaluable.  Because a \n14\nvertebral fracture can only get worse or at best remain at the same severity over time, the \n15\nGenant semi-quantitative grade for a vertebra can only increase or remain the same.  This \n16\nrationale will be used for handling missing data as follows and these imputations steps will be \n17\ndone before any analysis: \n18\nIf the Genant semi-quantitative grade on a given vertebra is 0 (ie, no fracture) at a later \n19\nvisit, it is reasonable to impute a grade of 0 for the same vertebra at previous visit(s) \n20\nincluding baseline.  \n21\nIf the Genant semi-quantitative grade on a given vertebra is > 0 at a later visit, any \n22\nmissing value for the same vertebra from previous visits will remain missing because \n23\nit cannot be certain when the vertebral fracture occurred., i.e., the value > 0 is \n24\napplicable at the time of first occurrence  \n25\nNote that baseline grades cannot be carried forward to impute missing post baseline values.\n26\nThe independent assessment of vertebral fractures classified according to the Genant semi-\n27\nquantitative grading conducted by the Central Review Committee (CRC) will be used for the \n28\nmain analysis.  If two CRC assessments are available, the second reviewer\u2019s assessment will \n29\nbe used.\n30\nStatistical Analysis Plan\nVersion No.: 6.0\nProduct: Denosumab\nDate: December 10, 2019\nProtocol Number 20050209 / ABCSG 18\n36\nThe main analysis of this endpoint will use logistic regression models including treatment \n1\ngroups as the independent variable and stratified by the randomization stratification factors. \n2\nAdditional investigatory analyses of covariates may be conducted. \n3\nSummary statistics will include the crude incidences at Month 36 and EOS, 95% CI, \n4\ndifferences between incidences in the two groups and 95% CI.  Hosmer-Lemeshow tests will \n5\nbe calculated to assess the goodness-of-fit of the models.  Deviance and Pearson residuals \n6\nand the diagonal elements of the hat matrix will be checked to detect outliers and influential \n7\nobservations.

The original BMD \n6\nrelated endpoints were to be subset on this stratum in order to limit variability across and \n7\nwithin subjects. During the blinded review of the data it has become apparent that during the \n8\ncourse of the study sites have changed their DXA devices and subjects may switch between \n9\nDXA machines during the duration of the study. Therefore the stratification factor does not \n10\nreflect the actual DXA machine type used. Consequently, the analyses of this endpoint will be \n11\nbased on the machine type reported on the subject\u2019s eCRF. Subjects will be included in the \n12\nmain BMD analyses if the same Hologic DXA device was used (see Section 4.1.3, BMD \n13\nanalysis set).\n14\nAn additional section regarding an analysis of DFS at 18 months after PADCD was included \n15\nin Version 4 of the SAP (15 September 2015) based on a recommendation of the DMC and \n16\ndecision of the Study Steering Committee and the Study Sponsor.\n17\nVersion 5 of this SAP includes the following changes to the statistical analyses planned to be \n18\nconducted within the amended clinical study protocol for ABCSG study 18 (Protocol Number: \n19\n20050209, Superseding Amendment 4, Date: 22 February 2016):\n20\nBased on recommendation from the Study Steering Committee, due to concerns of a \n21\npotential dilution effect caused by treatment crossover, an additional, exploratory \n \n22\nanalysis will be conducted early 2018, including the main DFS analysis, as well as all above \n23\nmentioned sensitivity analyses.\n24\n25\n",
