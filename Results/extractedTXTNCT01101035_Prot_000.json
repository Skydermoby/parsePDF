Subjects not on ULT will begin colchicine 0.6 mg QD on the \nDay 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will receive gout flare prophylaxis for the first six months of the study \nmedication treatment period. Alternatively, if colchicine is not tolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they \nwill be administered naproxen 250 mg twice daily (BID) with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been \nmaintained on an appropriate dose (as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) other \nthan lansoprazole, he/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In instances when subjects should not \nreceive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or prednisone may be provided \nat the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated guidelines listed under the Excluded Medications and \nTreatments section of the protocol. In the event that colchicine, naproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or \nprednisone are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage \nthe subject\u2019s gout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by the subject, 0.6 mg \nevery other day may be used.\nFollowing the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return for study visits during the first 3 months of the study based on the \nsubject\u2019s sUA response. Once a subject sUA <6.0 mg/dL there will be no further visits until Month 3.\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a Week 4 and Month 3 visit. \nIf the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit \nwill occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week \n4, and the next visit will occur at Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be \ndispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 6 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8 and the next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study medication at the Month 3 \nvisit. After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be made. All subjects will have a Month 3 and Month 6 \nvisits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the study. In addition, \nsubjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) and/or subjects who are elderly (\u226565 years of \nage) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor the liver function tests (LFTs). Subjects who are withdrawn \nfrom study medication treatment but have not withdrawn consent will be contacted every 2 months for the duration of \nthe study or until the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE. A Data Monitoring \nCommittee (DMC) unblinded to treatment assignment will periodically review results obtained in the study, including \nresults at 3 planned interim analyses. They will monitor the progress and the ongoing safety of subjects enrolled into \nthe study. An Independent CV Endpoints Committee will prospectively review all suspected serious CV events using \nblinded data. All investigational sites will be required to collect relevant clinical information required for adjudication \nof all deaths and potential CV SAEs.\nPrimary Objective:\nThe objective of this study is to compare the risk of predefined MACE during treatment with febuxostat and \nallopurinol in subjects with gout and CV comorbidities.\nSubject Population:\nMale subjects \u226550 years of age and female subjects \u226555 years of age and at least 2-years post-menopausal with gout \nand a prior history of major CV or cerebrovascular disease.\nNumber of Subjects:\nEstimated total of 7500 subjects:\n3750 subjects randomized to febuxostat\n3750 subjects randomized to allopurinol\nNumber of Sites:\nApproximately 465 sites (United States, Canada, and \nMexico)\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 13 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDose Level(s):\nFebuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg QD\nAllopurinol 200 mg to 600 mg QD in 100 mg increments\nRoute of Administration:\nOral\nDuration of Treatment:\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number \nof predefined MACE; however, the maximum length of \nparticipation is expected to be approximately 9 years.

The sample size will \nprovide at least 90% power to meet a noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio (febuxostat relative to \nallopurinol) for the primary endpoint assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0 at a 1-sided 2.5% significance level. For the \ndetermination of noninferiority between the febuxostat treatment group and the allopurinol treatment group, the \nsample size calculation assumed constant proportional hazards and exponential survival curves, annual adjudicated \nMACE composite rate of 2.8%, maximum length of participation of 5 years, accrual time of 2.5 years and annual \ndrop-out rate of 10%. This study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE. These assumptions were used prior to \nthe initiation of the study to calculate the number of subjects to be enrolled in order to obtain the required number of \nMACE.\nStatistical Considerations:\nThe primary endpoint and all other analyses by treatment group will be analyzed according to the randomized \ntreatment using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of all subjects who were randomized and received \nat least one dose of double-blind study medication. If a subject reports a MACE after treatment discontinuation, then \nthe reported event will be counted toward the treatment to which they were randomized.\nSafety Analyses\nAssuming constant proportional hazards, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint will be computed based on \nfebuxostat and allopurinol estimated hazard rates. The febuxostat treatment group will be compared to the allopurinol \ntreatment group to test for non-inferiority in the MACE composite rate using a Cox proportional hazards model with \ntreatment and baseline renal function as factors in the model. Non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol will be \ndeclared at an interim analysis or at the final analysis if the current 1-sided upper CI for the hazard ratio (febuxostat \nversus allopurinol) calculated with critical values obtained using the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending \nfunction, which preserves an overall 1-sided false-rejection rate of 2.5%, is less than 1.3.\nAnalysis of the secondary and other safety endpoints will be conducted similarly using a Cox proportional hazards \nmodel. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.\nAdditional analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using Cox-proportional hazards model \ncontrolling for the effect of NSAIDs use. The model will include treatment group, baseline renal function, and use of \nNSAIDs as explanatory variables. A similar analysis will control for the effect of low-dose aspirin use.\nInterim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination.\nThis study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE for assessing non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to \nallopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0 and 90% power. Interim analyses will \nbe conducted when approximately 25%, 50% and 75% of the events have occurred, followed by a final analysis. At \neach analysis, if the upper one-sided confidence limit of the hazard ratio is less than 1.3, the study will be stopped and \nthe non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk will be declared.\nPeriodically during the course of the study a blinded assessment of the annual adjudicated composite MACE rate will \nbe made. The number of subjects planned to be enrolled in this study was based on an event rate of 2.8%, which was \nbased on limited information. Based on the overall blinded composite MACE rate observed, an assessment will be \nmade to determine whether or not to adjust the number of subjects planned for enrollment.\n",

Subjects not on ULT will begin colchicine \n0.6 mg QD on the Day 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will receive gout flare prophylaxis for \nthe first six months of the study medication treatment period. Alternatively, if colchicine is not \ntolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they will be administered naproxen 250 mg twice \ndaily (BID) with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been maintained on an appropriate dose \n(as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) other than lansoprazole, \nhe/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In instances when subjects should not \nreceive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or \nprednisone may be provided at the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated \nguidelines listed under the Excluded Medications and Treatments section of the protocol. In the \nevent that colchicine, naproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or prednisone are not \ntolerated or are contraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage \nthe subject\u2019s gout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by \nthe subject, 0.6 mg every other day may be used. Following the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return for \nstudy visits during the first 3 months of the study based on the subject\u2019s sUA response. Once a \nsubject sUA <6.0 mg/dL there will be no further visits until Month 3 (Figure 6.b).\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a \nWeek 4 and Month 3 visit.

After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be made. \nAll subjects will have a Month 3 and Month 6 visits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the \nstudy. In addition, subjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) and/or \nsubjects who are elderly (\u226565 years of age) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor \nthe liver function tests (LFTs).

Subjects will orally self-administer a single dose of 0.6 mg colchicine QD \nbeginning on the day that it is dispensed and continuing until the next Study Visit.\nThe Investigator may use a reduced colchicine regimen (for example, colchicine 0.6 mg on \nalternate days) if required because of concomitant medications (medications with potential \ndrug-drug interactions with colchicine, including verapamil and diltiazem but excluding those \nwith potential strong interactions listed in Section 7.3.2), co-morbid conditions including chronic \nkidney disease, or patient preference based on prior experience with colchicine.\nSubjects receiving colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis will return the previously dispensed bottle \nand any unused medication to the site at their next scheduled visit.\nDrug Interaction: Macrolides, Ketolides, and Concomitant Colchicine\nWhen a subject is receiving colchicine, the administration of a concomitant macrolide or ketolide \nis prohibited. An alternative antibiotic treatment option is recommended, when possible. However, \nif no alternative is available, a subject who is on colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis or treatment, \nand who requires treatment with a macrolide or ketolide must be temporarily discontinued from \ncolchicine and switched to naproxen, when possible, for the duration of the macrolide or ketolide \ntreatment and remain off of colchicine for 3 days following the last dose of the macrolide or \nketolide. Subjects may resume colchicine on the fourth day following the last dose of the \nmacrolide or ketolide. Subjects, who are temporarily switched from colchicine to naproxen for \ngout flare prophylaxis during the course of the macrolide or ketolide prescription, and for the \n3 days following the last dose, should be provided with a prescription for naproxen for the duration \nthey need to take it. However, if subjects are permanently switched from colchicine to naproxen as \na result of requiring a concurrent macrolide or ketolide, the sites may contact the IVRS/IWRS to \nhave naproxen supplies administered. If naproxen is not tolerated by a subject, the Takeda Medical \nMonitor should be contacted to discuss alternative prophylaxis options. Although it is preferred \nthat a subject who requires a macrolide or ketolide be switched to naproxen (or an alternative \nprophylaxis), gout flare prophylaxis may be interrupted entirely, but is not recommended as the \nrisk of a gout flare may increase. Subjects who are on naproxen for gout flare prophylaxis may take \na concomitant macrolide or ketolide without stopping naproxen.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 44 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nNaproxen\nNaproxen \n.)

Approximately 7500 subjects will be randomly assigned to study medication treatment.\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of predefined major cardiovascular events (MACE). The \nlength of study is expected to be approximately 9 years. The length of study participation for each subject will vary \ndue to the event driven study design. This study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE.\nSubjects will be screened at Day -7 for entry. Subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities, gout and (1) a serum urate \nlevel (sUA) \u22657 mg/dL or (2) with a sUA \u22656 mg/dL AND at least 1 flare in the 12 months prior to screening and/or the \npresence of tophi) and who meet the other selection criteria will be enrolled.\nOn Study Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat once daily (QD) or \nallopurinol QD. Randomization will be stratified based on baseline renal function: subjects with normal renal function \nor mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance [eCLcr] \u226560 mL/min) versus subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min).\nSubjects randomized to febuxostat will initially receive the 40 mg dose QD. Subjects will remain on 40 mg for the \nremainder of the study if their sUA is <6.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days). If their sUA is \u22656.0 mg/dL at the \nWeek 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days) they will receive febuxostat 80 mg QD at Week 4 visit (\uf0b13 days), and will remain on this dose \nfor the remainder of the study. No dose adjustment will be made in the febuxostat based on renal function.\nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have normal renal function or mild renal impairment (eCLcr \u226560 mL/min) \nwill initially receive allopurinol 300 mg QD with the dose increased in 100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA \n<6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 600 mg QD is achieved. Subjects randomized to allopurinol who have moderate \nrenal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 200 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 400 mg QD is achieved.\nTo maintain the double-blind nature of the study, febuxostat and allopurinol tablets will be over-encapsulated and \nmatching placebo capsules will be manufactured which are identical in appearance. Subjects will orally self administer \n2 capsules each morning in the appropriate combination for their assigned dose and treatment. For details regarding \nthe appropriate dose combination, please see Section 8.1.3.\nSerum urate levels will be unblinded to the investigator and Takeda through the Week 10 Visit of the study to facilitate \ndose increases based on sUA response. After the Week 10 Visit, sUA measurements will be blinded to Takeda and the \ninvestigator. The interactive voice-activated response system/interactive web-activated response system \n(IVRS/IWRS) will manage the treatment assignment at randomization and throughout the study medication treatment \nperiod.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 12 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nSubjects currently on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) will discontinue treatment at the Day -7 Screening Visit, and will \nbegin colchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis. Subjects not on ULT will begin colchicine 0.6 mg QD on the \nDay 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will receive gout flare prophylaxis for the first six months of the study \nmedication treatment period. Alternatively, if colchicine is not tolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they \nwill be administered naproxen 250 mg twice daily (BID) with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been \nmaintained on an appropriate dose (as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) other \nthan lansoprazole, he/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In instances when subjects should not \nreceive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or prednisone may be provided \nat the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated guidelines listed under the Excluded Medications and \nTreatments section of the protocol. In the event that colchicine, naproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or \nprednisone are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage \nthe subject\u2019s gout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by the subject, 0.6 mg \nevery other day may be used.\nFollowing the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return for study visits during the first 3 months of the study based on the \nsubject\u2019s sUA response. Once a subject sUA <6.0 mg/dL there will be no further visits until Month 3.\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a Week 4 and Month 3 visit. \nIf the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit \nwill occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week \n4, and the next visit will occur at Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be \ndispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 6 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8 and the next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study medication at the Month 3 \nvisit. After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be made. All subjects will have a Month 3 and Month 6 \nvisits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the study. In addition, \nsubjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) and/or subjects who are elderly (\u226565 years of \nage) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor the liver function tests (LFTs). Subjects who are withdrawn \nfrom study medication treatment but have not withdrawn consent will be contacted every 2 months for the duration of \nthe study or until the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE. A Data Monitoring \nCommittee (DMC) unblinded to treatment assignment will periodically review results obtained in the study, including \nresults at 3 planned interim analyses. They will monitor the progress and the ongoing safety of subjects enrolled into \nthe study. An Independent CV Endpoints Committee will prospectively review all suspected serious CV events using \nblinded data. All investigational sites will be required to collect relevant clinical information required for adjudication \nof all deaths and potential CV SAEs.\nPrimary Objective:\nThe objective of this study is to compare the risk of predefined MACE during treatment with febuxostat and \nallopurinol in subjects with gout and CV comorbidities.\nSubject Population:\nMale subjects \u226550 years of age and female subjects \u226555 years of age and at least 2-years post-menopausal with gout \nand a prior history of major CV or cerebrovascular disease.\nNumber of Subjects:\nEstimated total of 7500 subjects:\n3750 subjects randomized to febuxostat\n3750 subjects randomized to allopurinol\nNumber of Sites:\nApproximately 465 sites (United States, Canada, and \nMexico)\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 13 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDose Level(s):\nFebuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg QD\nAllopurinol 200 mg to 600 mg QD in 100 mg increments\nRoute of Administration:\nOral\nDuration of Treatment:\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number \nof predefined MACE; however, the maximum length of \nparticipation is expected to be approximately 9 years.

The sample size will \nprovide at least 90% power to meet a noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio (febuxostat relative to \nallopurinol) for the primary endpoint assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0 at a 1-sided 2.5% significance level. For the \ndetermination of noninferiority between the febuxostat treatment group and the allopurinol treatment group, the \nsample size calculation assumed constant proportional hazards and exponential survival curves, annual adjudicated \nMACE composite rate of 2.8%, maximum length of participation of 5 years, accrual time of 2.5 years and annual \ndrop-out rate of 10%. This study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE. These assumptions were used prior to \nthe initiation of the study to calculate the number of subjects to be enrolled in order to obtain the required number of \nMACE.\nStatistical Considerations:\nThe primary endpoint and all other analyses by treatment group will be analyzed according to the randomized \ntreatment using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of all subjects who were randomized and received \nat least one dose of double-blind study medication. If a subject reports a MACE after treatment discontinuation, then \nthe reported event will be counted toward the treatment to which they were randomized.\nSafety Analyses\nAssuming constant proportional hazards, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint will be computed based on \nfebuxostat and allopurinol estimated hazard rates. The febuxostat treatment group will be compared to the allopurinol \ntreatment group to test for non-inferiority in the MACE composite rate using a Cox proportional hazards model with \ntreatment and baseline renal function as factors in the model. Non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol will be \ndeclared at an interim analysis or at the final analysis if the current 1-sided upper CI for the hazard ratio (febuxostat \nversus allopurinol) calculated with critical values obtained using the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending \nfunction, which preserves an overall 1-sided false-rejection rate of 2.5%, is less than 1.3.\nAnalysis of the secondary and other safety endpoints will be conducted similarly using a Cox proportional hazards \nmodel. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.\nAdditional analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using Cox-proportional hazards model \ncontrolling for the effect of NSAIDs use. The model will include treatment group, baseline renal function, and use of \nNSAIDs as explanatory variables. A similar analysis will control for the effect of low-dose aspirin use.\nInterim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination.\nThis study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE for assessing non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to \nallopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0 and 90% power. Interim analyses will \nbe conducted when approximately 25%, 50% and 75% of the events have occurred, followed by a final analysis. At \neach analysis, if the upper one-sided confidence limit of the hazard ratio is less than 1.3, the study will be stopped and \nthe non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk will be declared.\nPeriodically during the course of the study a blinded assessment of the annual adjudicated composite MACE rate will \nbe made. The number of subjects planned to be enrolled in this study was based on an event rate of 2.8%, which was \nbased on limited information. Based on the overall blinded composite MACE rate observed, an assessment will be \nmade to determine whether or not to adjust the number of subjects planned for enrollment.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 16 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n3.0\nSTUDY REFERENCE INFORMATION\n3.1\nStudy-Related Responsibilities\nThe sponsor will perform all study-related activities with the exception of those identified below. \nThe identified vendors will perform these activities in full or in partnership with the sponsor.\nActivity\nUS and Canada\nMexico\nSite Monitoring\nCentral laboratory\nData management\nStatistical analysis\nInteractive voice-activated response \nsystem\nClinical supply packaging and \ndistribution\nClinical supply return\nPPD\nPPD\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 17 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n3.2\nPrincipal Investigator\nTakeda Development Center Americas, Inc.

Gout is a serious health condition characterized by flares of acute arthritis, \nchronic gouty arthropathy, tophi, and uric acid urolithiasis, and is associated with a broad range of \ncomorbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) disease, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic \nsyndrome [4-6]. The underlying metabolic aberration in gout is hyperuricemia, which is defined as \nan elevation in serum uric acid (sUA) level \u22656.8 mg/dL. Hyperuricemia develops into gout when \nurate crystals are formed from supersaturated body fluids and are deposited in joints, tophi, and \nparenchymal organs eliciting acute inflammatory responses.\nUrate-lowering therapy (ULT) is used to treat hyperuricemia in subjects with gout. The goal of \ntherapy is to reduce sUA to 6.0 mg/dL or less, below the concentration at which monosodium urate \nsaturates extracellular fluid. Using ULT to reduce and maintain sUA levels <6.0 mg/dL ultimately \nimproves the clinical symptoms of gout by reducing the frequency of gout flares, decreasing size \nand number of tophi, and improving quality of life. Due to the potential for paradoxical flares \ncaused by urate crystal mobilization, anti-inflammatory agents and/or colchicine are given as \nprophylaxis with ULT during the first 6 months of treatment [7].\nGout subjects also have a high incidence of comorbidities that may be associated with \nhyperuricemia, gout, or both. This is supported by a growing body of literature demonstrating that \nsUA level is an independent predictive factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) when the effects of \nother risk factors have been controlled. Several recent studies report an increased risk of CV death, \nmyocardial infarction (MI), and stroke associated with higher sUA levels. For example, the \nPreventive Cardiology Information System Database Cohort Study, which assessed the prognostic \nvalue of sUA in 3098 persons at risk for CVD, found that sUA was an independent predictor of \ndeath from all causes; for every 1 mg/dL elevation in sUA level, the risk of death from all cause in \nsubjects at high risk of CVD increased by 39% (hazard ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.28-1.50) without \nadjusting for other risk factors. After adjusting for other risk factors, the sUA level remained a \npredictor of death from all causes (hazard ratio=1.26, 95% CI 1.15-1.38) [8]. In the Framingham \nHeart study, sUA was not an independent predictor of coronary artery disease in men without gout, \nbut there was a 60% excess incidence of coronaryartery disease in men with gout never treated \nwith diuretics [9]. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study reported a direct \nrole for hyperuricemia in CV events and mortality, tying sUA levels to increasing CV mortality. \nThese findings persisted even after adjustments were made for age, sex, race, body mass index, \nsmoking, hypertension, and diabetes [10].\n4.1.1\nMechanism of Action\nFebuxostat is a potent, nonpurine, selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO) that exhibits \nantihyperuricemic activity by reducing the formation of uric acid. Uric acid is the end product of \npurine metabolism and is generated in the cascade of hypoxanthine\u2192xanthine\u2192uric acid. Both \nsteps in this transformation are catalyzed by XO. Febuxostat has been shown to potently inhibit \nboth the oxidized and reduced forms of XO. Unlike febuxostat, administration of allopurinol does \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 21 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nnot provide persistent enzyme inhibition and has weaker hypouricemic activity. More importantly, \nbecause allopurinol and its metabolites are purine analogs, they also inhibit other enzymes \ninvolved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. In contrast, febuxostat is a selective inhibitor of \nXO.\n4.1.2\nNonclinical Data Summary\nRelevant CV related nonclinical data are summarized below.\nFebuxostat is a nonpurine, selective inhibitor of XO that inhibits the formation of uric acid from \nhypoxanthine and xanthine. XO inhibition is not known to cause CV adverse effects.\nNonclinical safety pharmacology and secondary pharmacology studies demonstrated no \nmechanisms associating febuxostat with CV effects at therapeutic exposures. CV safety \npharmacology studies included in vitro electrophysiology investigation on cardiac action potential \nparameters and ion channels (potassium [human ether-\u00e0-go-go\u2013related gene], sodium, and \ncalcium), and in vivo studies for hemodynamic and electrocardiogram (ECG) effects in both \nanesthetized and conscious telemetry-monitored dogs. In addition, the in vitro effects of \nfebuxostat on the hemostatic system, protease generation, and platelet function were explored \nusing human blood. Febuxostat did not significantly inhibit nor augment platelet or coagulation \nresponses and did not have any interactions in vitro with heparin, warfarin, or aspirin.\nFurthermore, in a long-term (52-week) toxicology study in dogs, no CV toxicity was observed \nbased on electrocardiographic, organ weight, and histopathological examinations.\nFebuxostat was also shown to have no detrimental CV effects in animal CV models. Overall, when \nstudied in 6 different animal models specific for CV diseases, febuxostat had no detrimental CV \neffect, but rather appeared to have beneficial CV effects. In summary, no biological mechanism \nwas identified to be associated with febuxostat that could cause potential CV adverse effects.\n4.2\nRATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED STUDY\nThe febuxostat Phase 3 randomized controlled studies revealed a small number of cardiovascular \nthromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions and non-fatal \nstrokes) in subjects treated with febuxostat (0.74 per 100 PY with 95% CI 0.36-1.37) compared to \nallopurinol (0.60 per 100 PY with 95% CI 0.16-1.53). In the phase 3 clinical program for \nfebuxostat approximately 60% of subjects had 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors (including \ndiabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking).\nIn order to further explore the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat, Takeda has committed to \nconduct a randomized, controlled trial of adequate size and duration to determine whether the use \nof febuxostat is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular \noutcomes as compared to allopurinol.\nThis study will enroll subjects with a high cardiovascular risk profile, characterized by the \npresence of documented history of any of the following: cerebrovascular, coronary, peripheral \nvascular disease, or the diagnosis of diabetes with microvascular or macrovascular complications. \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 22 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nThis randomized controlled study will attempt to enroll populations of interest including women \n(5%), elderly (20%) and renally impaired (30%).\nThe primary endpoint of the study will be a pre-defined composite of major adverse cardiovascular \nevents (MACE).

Approximately 7500 subjects will be randomly assigned to study \nmedication treatment.\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of predefined MACE. The length of \nstudy is expected to be approximately 9 years. The length of study participation for each subject \nwill vary due to the event driven study design. This study is designed to have a maximum of \n624 MACE.\nSubjects will be screened at Day -7 for entry. Subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities, gout and \n(1) a sUA \u22657 mg/dL or (2) with a sUA \u22656 mg/dL AND at least one flare in the 12 months prior to \nscreening and/or the presence of tophi) and who meet the other selection criteria will be enrolled.\nOn Study Day 1/Randomization Visit, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive \neither febuxostat once daily (QD) or allopurinol QD. Randomization will be stratified based on \nbaseline renal function: subjects with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated \ncreatinine clearance [(eCLcr) \u226560 mL/min] versus subjects with moderate renal impairment \n[eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min]).\nSubjects randomized to febuxostat will initially receive the 40 mg dose QD. Subjects will remain \non 40 mg remainder of the study if their sUA is <6.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days). If their \nsUA is \u22656.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days) they will receive febuxostat 80 mg QD at Week \n4 visit (\uf0b13 days), and will remain on this dose for the remainder of the study. No dose adjustment \nwill be made in the febuxostat based on renal function.\nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have normal renal function or mild renal impairment \n(eCLcr \u226560 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 300 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 600 mg QD is \nachieved. Subjects randomized to allopurinol who have moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \n\u226530 but <60 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 200 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 400 mg QD is \nachieved.\nTo maintain the double-blind nature of the study, febuxostat and allopurinol tablets will be \nover-encapsulated and matching placebo capsules will be manufactured which are identical in \nappearance. Subjects will orally self administer 2 capsules each morning in the appropriate \ncombination for their assigned dose and treatment. For details regarding the appropriate dose \ncombination, please see Section 8.1.3.\nSerum urate levels will be unblinded to the investigator and Takeda through the Week 10 Visit of \nthe study to facilitate dose increases based on sUA response. After the Week 10 Visit, sUA \nmeasurements will be blinded to Takeda and the investigator. The interactive voice-activated \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 26 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nresponse system/interactive web-activated response system (IVRS/IWRS) will manage the \ntreatment assignment at randomization and throughout the study medication treatment period.\nSubjects currently on ULT will discontinue treatment at the Day -7 Screening Visit, and will begin \ncolchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis. Subjects not on ULT will begin colchicine \n0.6 mg QD on the Day 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will receive gout flare prophylaxis for \nthe first six months of the study medication treatment period. Alternatively, if colchicine is not \ntolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they will be administered naproxen 250 mg twice \ndaily (BID) with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been maintained on an appropriate dose \n(as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) other than lansoprazole, \nhe/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In instances when subjects should not \nreceive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or \nprednisone may be provided at the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated \nguidelines listed under the Excluded Medications and Treatments section of the protocol. In the \nevent that colchicine, naproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or prednisone are not \ntolerated or are contraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage \nthe subject\u2019s gout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by \nthe subject, 0.6 mg every other day may be used. Following the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return for \nstudy visits during the first 3 months of the study based on the subject\u2019s sUA response. Once a \nsubject sUA <6.0 mg/dL there will be no further visits until Month 3 (Figure 6.b).\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a \nWeek 4 and Month 3 visit. If the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed \nstudy medication at Week 4, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit will occur \nat Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the \nsubject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If \nthe Week 6 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8 and \nthe next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study \nmedication at the Month 3 visit. After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be made. \nAll subjects will have a Month 3 and Month 6 visits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the \nstudy. In addition, subjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) and/or \nsubjects who are elderly (\u226565 years of age) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor \nthe liver function tests (LFTs). Subjects who are withdrawn from study medication treatment but \nhave not withdrawn consent will be contacted every 2 months for the duration of the study or until \nthe subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE.\nA Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) unblinded to the treatment assignment will periodically \nreview results obtained in the enrolled into the study. An independent CV Endpoints Committee \nwill be established to prospectively review all suspected CV events using blinded data.

Prophylaxis medications can be taken on the \nmorning of the study visit. The prophylaxis medications will remain unblinded. Drug \naccountability will be performed on all Takeda supplied prophylaxis medications.\n7.3.1\nMedications and Treatments Not Provided Directly by Sponsor\nDuring the first six months subjects should be provided additional treatments as appropriate for \ngout flares by their study physician. In addition to dispensing the gout flare prophylaxis, the \ninvestigator may provide the subject with a prescription for an anti-inflammatory/analgesic agent \nof the investigator\u2019s choosing to be used in the event the subject experiences a gout flare during the \nstudy. The Investigator may use a reduced colchicine regimen (for example, colchicine 0.6 mg on \nalternate days) if required because of concomitant medications (medications with potential \ndrug-drug interactions with colchicine, including verapamil, diltiazem, etc. (see Section 7.3.2), \nco-morbid conditions including chronic kidney disease, or patient preference based on prior \nexperience with colchicine.

In addition to dispensing the gout flare prophylaxis, the \ninvestigator may provide the subject with a prescription for an anti-inflammatory/analgesic agent \nof the investigator\u2019s choosing to be used in the event the subject experiences a gout flare during the \nstudy. \nAfter the first six months of gout flare prophylaxis, the United States (US) subjects only will be \nable to receive medication to treat gout flares during the study (eg, colchicine, naproxen and \nlansoprazole, Medrol dose pack, prednisone, indomethacin) using a prescription card to ensure \nthey have adequate medications available to treat gout flares. The study physician should \ndetermine which medication is appropriate for each subject for treatment of gout flares.\nThese medications should be documented in the subject\u2019s source documents and on the \nappropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).\n7.3.2\nExcluded Medications and Treatments\nSubjects may not take any medication (other than study medication) for the purpose of lowering \nsUA levels from at least 7 days prior to the Day 1 Randomization Visit to the End of \nStudy/Discontinuation of Treatment/Early Termination Visit. Medications prescribed for another \nindication but which have an incidental urate lowering effect (for example losartan, fenofibrate) \nare not excluded.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 35 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nSubjects who have taken any of the excluded medications listed below can be enrolled into the \nstudy if the excluded medication is discontinued at least 7 days prior to the Day 1 Randomization \nVisit. These medications may not be administered during the treatment phase. All medication use \nshould be documented in the subject\u2019s source documents and on the appropriate eCRF.\nSubjects who have terminated study drug but remain in the study (eg, bimonthly follow-up \ncontacts) may have their gout treated in keeping with the physician\u2019s accepted practice.\nAdditionally, the following medications are not to be administered within 7 days prior to the Day 1 \nRandomization Visit and throughout the study medication treatment phase:\n\uf0b7\nAny urate-lowering drug other than study medication. \n\uf0b7\nSalicylates (chronic use of aspirin \u2264325 mg/day is allowed).\n\uf0b7\nAzathioprine.\n\uf0b7\nMercaptopurine.\n\uf0b7\nTheophylline.\n\uf0b7\nIntravenous colchicine.\n\uf0b7\nPyrazinamide.\n\uf0b7\nSulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.\n\uf0b7\nMacrolides or ketolides, only when a subject is receiving concomitant colchicine.\n\uf0b7\nSubjects with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine in conjunction with \nP-gp or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Follow-up contacts will occur \nevery 2 months (\u00b110 days).\nThe primary reason for permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment should be noted using \nthe following categories:\n1. AE. The subject has experienced an AE that requires early termination because continued \nparticipation imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject\u2019s health or the subject is unwilling to \ncontinue because of the AE.\nNOTE: Subjects who experience ALT or AST >3xULN in conjunction with elevated total \nbilirubin >2\u00d7ULN and satisfy the following 2 criteria: (1) The liver injury is hepatocellular in \nnature and there is not a prominent cholestatic component, or (2) there is no more likely \nalternative cause than drug induced liver injury, such as acute viral hepatitis A or B, or other \nacute liver disease, should be permanently discontinued from the study drug treatment.\n2. Major protocol deviation. The discovery post randomization that the subject failed to meet \nprotocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol requirements, and continued participation \nposes an unnecessary risk to the subject\u2019s health.\n3. Voluntary withdrawal. The subject (or subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative) wishes to \nwithdraw from taking study drug treatment. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be \nrecorded in the eCRF.\nNOTE: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal \nand, where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded.\n4. Pregnancy. The subject is found to be pregnant.\n5. Lost to follow-up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject \nwere unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented. \n6. Study termination. The sponsor, IRB, ethics committee (EC), or regulatory agency terminates \nthe study.\n7. Other. The specific reasons should be recorded in the \u201cspecify\u201d field of the eCRF.\nThe primary reason that the subject prematurely discontinued study drug should be listed on the \nEnd of Study Drug page of the eCRF. End of Study Drug eCRF should be completed when the \nsubject discontinues study medication or completes the full cycle of study medication; end of \nStudy Drug eCRF completion is independent of the decision to continue participation in the study \nvia follow-up contacts.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 37 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nThese subjects should undergo all procedures required as part of the Discontinuation of Treatment \nVisit when the subject stops study drug treatment. In the event that these subjects later withdraw \nconsent from participation in the study, an additional final Early Termination visit does not need to \nbe performed.\nAt each follow-up contact, sites will ask the subject if they have taken any new medications (over \nthe counter or prescription) since the last contact, or have stopped taking any ongoing medications \nrecorded at the last contact. If yes, the generic medication name, start date, and end date and reason \nfor use will be recorded on the Medication Information Obtained During Follow-up Contact \neCRF.\nSites will also ask the subject at each follow-up contact if they have had any serious adverse events \n(SAEs) or any potential cardiovascular adverse events since the last contact. If yes, these will be \nrecorded on the AE eCRF, and sites should follow the instructions in the Protocol Section 10.2.2, \nCollection and Reporting of SAEs if applicable. All SAEs should be followed up until resolution \nor permanent outcome of the event.\nIf the subject has had a potential serious CV event, he/she should bring the event related \ndocuments (labs, hospital discharge summary, etc) to the clinic. The study team will notify the site \nin writing upon a positive MACE adjudication when it is no longer necessary to follow a subject.\nEfforts will be made to prevent any subject being lost to follow-up during the conduct of the study. \nInvestigators should refer to Section 9.0 for gout flare assessment and Section 9.1.15 for gout flare \ntreatment. Before a subject is considered lost to follow-up, a minimum of two documented \ntelephone contact attempts must have been made and one certified letter must have been sent \nwithin 4 weeks of the most recently missed telephone call to the subject and/or emergency contact \nin an effort to contact the subject.\n7.5\nProcedures for Early Termination of a Subject from the Study (Both Drug and \nVisits)\nA subject may discontinue his or her participation from the study without giving a reason at any \ntime during the study. In addition, efforts should be made to perform all procedures required as \npart of the Early Termination Visit, even if the subject withdrew consent.\nThe primary reason for discontinuation of study participation should be noted using the following \ncategories:\n1. Adverse Event. A subject taking study medication has experienced a pretreatment event or AE \nthat requires early termination because continued participation imposes an unacceptable risk to \nthe subject\u2019s health or the subject is unwilling to continue because of the event. Also applies to \nsubjects no longer taking study medication who are in follow-up who experience a serious CV \nevent that is positively adjudicated as a MACE. NOTE: this reason is not intended to be \nselected for subjects in follow-up experiencing non-MACE AEs as these subjects can, and \nshould, continue participation.\n2. Lost to follow-up. The subject did not return to the clinic and/or attempts to contact the subject \nwere unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented. Before a subject is \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 38 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nconsidered lost to follow-up, a minimum of two documented telephone contact attempts and \none certified letter within 4 weeks of the most recently missed study visit must be sent in an \neffort to contact the subject.\n3. Voluntary withdrawal. The subject (or subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative) wishes to \nwithdraw from the study. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the \neCRF.\n4. Major protocol deviation. The discovery post randomization that the subject failed to meet \nprotocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol requirements, and continued participation \nposes an unnecessary risk to the subject\u2019s health.\n5. Study termination. The sponsor, IRB, EC, or regulatory agency terminates the study.\n6. Other. The specific reasons should be recorded in the \u201cspecify\u201d field of the eCRF.\nThe primary reason that the subject prematurely discontinued planned study visits, including the \nplanned follow-up contacts, should be listed on the End of Study Visits page of the eCRF. End of \nStudy Visits eCRF should be completed when the subject discontinues from the study visits, \nincluding the follow-up contacts, independent of the decision to discontinue study medication.\nInvestigators should refer to Section 9.0 for gout flare assessment and Section 9.1.15 for gout flare \ntreatment.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 39 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n8.0\nSTUDY MEDICATION AND TREATMENTS\n8.1\nStudy Medication and Treatments\nOral administration of:\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 40 mg tablet of febuxostat (35 count [ct.] bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 80 mg tablet of febuxostat (35 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing two 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (35 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing three 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (35 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOne matching placebo capsule (35 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 40 mg tablet of febuxostat (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 80 mg tablet of febuxostat (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing two 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing three 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOne matching placebo capsule (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 40 mg tablet of febuxostat (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 80 mg tablet of febuxostat (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing two 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing three 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOne matching placebo capsule (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nProphylaxis treatment: colchicine 0.6 mg tablet (100 ct. bottle) OR naproxen 250 mg tablet \n(100 ct. bottle) and lansoprazole 15 mg capsule (30 ct. bottle) will be provided for the first \n6 months.\n8.1.1\nDosage Form, Manufacturing, Packaging, and Labeling\nDouble-Blind Study Medication (febuxostat 40 mg, 80 mg and Allopurinol 200 mg, 300 mg)\nDouble-blind study medication will consist of over-encapsulated febuxostat 40 mg, febuxostat \n80 mg, allopurinol 200 mg, allopurinol 300 mg and matching placebo capsules which are identical \nin appearance.\nThe capsules will be packaged into 3 different sizes of high density polyethylene bottles with child \nresistant caps containing 35 capsules, 100 capsules and 200 capsules each.

Subjects should not \nreceive colchicine if they have a history of hypersensitivity to colchicine. Subjects with renal or \nhepatic impairment should not be given colchicine in conjunction with P-gp or strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitors. In these patients, life-threatening and fatal colchicine toxicity has been reported with \ncolchicine taken in therapeutic doses. In addition, the following warnings and precautions are \nnoted for colchicine use:\n\uf0b7\nFatal overdoses have been reported with colchicine in adults and children. Keep colchicine out \nof the reach of children.\n\uf0b7\nMyelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia \nhave been reported with colchicine at therapeutic doses.\n\uf0b7\nColchicine-induced neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with \nchronic treatment at therapeutic doses. Patients with renal dysfunction and elderly patients, \neven those with normal renal and hepatic function, are at increased risk. Concomitant use of \natorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, \nbenzafibrate or cyclosporine with colchicine may potentiate the development of myopathy. \nOnce colchicine is stopped, the symptoms generally resolve within one week to several months \n[12].\n\uf0b7\nCo-administration of colchicine with P-gp and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors have been demonstrated \nto alter the concentration of colchicine resulting in life-threatening interaction and death.

An alternative antibiotic treatment option is recommended, when possible. However, \nif no alternative is available, a subject who is on colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis or treatment, \nand who requires treatment with a macrolide or ketolide must be temporarily discontinued from \ncolchicine and switched to naproxen, when possible, for the duration of the macrolide or ketolide \ntreatment and remain off of colchicine for 3 days following the last dose of the macrolide or \nketolide. Subjects may resume colchicine on the fourth day following the last dose of the \nmacrolide or ketolide. Subjects, who are temporarily switched from colchicine to naproxen for \ngout flare prophylaxis during the course of the macrolide or ketolide prescription, and for the \n3 days following the last dose, should be provided with a prescription for naproxen for the duration \nthey need to take it. However, if subjects are permanently switched from colchicine to naproxen as \na result of requiring a concurrent macrolide or ketolide, the sites may contact the IVRS/IWRS to \nhave naproxen supplies administered. If naproxen is not tolerated by a subject, the Takeda Medical \nMonitor should be contacted to discuss alternative prophylaxis options. Although it is preferred \nthat a subject who requires a macrolide or ketolide be switched to naproxen (or an alternative \nprophylaxis), gout flare prophylaxis may be interrupted entirely, but is not recommended as the \nrisk of a gout flare may increase. Subjects who are on naproxen for gout flare prophylaxis may take \na concomitant macrolide or ketolide without stopping naproxen.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 44 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nNaproxen\nNaproxen \n.)

The medication number of the investigational drug to be dispensed will be provided by the \nIVRS/IWRS.\n8.5\nUnblinding Procedure\nThe investigational drug blind shall not be broken by the investigator unless information \nconcerning the study medication is necessary for the medical treatment of the subject. The sponsor \nmust be notified before the investigational drug blind is broken unless a medical emergency \nrequiring unblinding occurs. In this case the investigator (or designee) at the site should contact the \nsponsor (see contact information listed in Section 1.1) within 24 hours.\nFor unblinding a subject, the investigational drug blind can be obtained by accessing the IVRS. \nPlease refer to IVRS Unblinding Worksheet packet. \nThe date, time, and reason the blind was broken must be recorded in the source document and on \nthe appropriate eCRF.\nIf the investigator is unblinded, investigational drug must be stopped immediately. Subjects will \nhave the End of Study/Discontinuation of Treatment/Early Termination visit but will continue to \nbe followed until the end of the study via follow-up contacts.\n8.6\nAccountability and Destruction of Sponsor-Supplied Drugs\nDrug supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being returned.\nUpon receipt of delivery of study medication and prophylaxis medications, the investigator (or \ninvestigator\u2019s designee) must access the IVRS/IWRS to confirm receipt of study medication and \nprophylaxis medications and verify the contents and condition of the shipment against the packing \nlist. Any discrepancies between the packing list and the actual contents must be communicated to \nthe assigned study monitor or a Takeda designee to resolve the issue. The packing list should then \nbe filed in the investigator\u2019s essential document file. Once this process is completed, the study \nmedication and prophylaxis medications should be stored in an appropriate, secure location as \ndescribed in Section 8.0. Resupplies will be handled via IVRS/IWRS. The number of \ncapsules/tablets dispensed and returned will be documented in the subject\u2019s source documents, \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 47 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\neCRF, and recorded on drug accountability logs retained with the investigator\u2019s essential \ndocument file.\nThe investigator must maintain 100% accountability for all sponsor-supplied drugs received and \ndispensed during his or her entire participation in the study. Proper drug accountability includes, \nbut is not limited to:\n\uf0b7\nFrequently verifying that actual inventory matches documented inventory.\n\uf0b7\nVerifying that all bottles used are documented accurately on the log.\n\uf0b7\nVerifying that required fields are completed accurately and legibly.\nIf any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately.\nThe investigator must maintain a current inventory (Drug Accountability Log) of all \nsponsor-supplied study medication delivered to the site, inventory at the site, and subject\u2019s use \nrecords. This log must accurately reflect the drug accountability of the study medication at all \ntimes. The following information will be recorded at a minimum: protocol number and title, name \nof investigator, site identifier and number, description of sponsor-supplied medication and amount \ndispensed, and the date and amount returned to the site by the subject, including the initials of the \nperson dispensing and receiving the study medication. The log should include all required \ninformation as a separate entry for each subject to whom study medication is dispensed.\nPrior to site closure or at appropriate intervals, a representative from the sponsor or its designee \nwill perform clinical study material accountability and reconciliation before clinical study \nmaterials are returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction. The investigator will retain the \ncopy of the original documentation regarding clinical study material accountability, return, and/or \ndestruction, and the original will be sent to the sponsor.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 48 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n9.0\nSTUDY PLAN\n9.1\nStudy Procedures\nThe following sections describe the procedures to be completed at Screening and during the study. \nSubjects are to be assessed by the same investigator or site personnel whenever possible. The \nSchedule of Study Procedures is found in Appendix A.\n9.1.1\nInformed Consent Procedure\nThe requirements of the informed consent are described in Section 15.2.\nInformed consent must be obtained prior to the subject entering into the study, and before any \nprotocol-directed procedures are performed.\nA unique subject identification number (subject number) will be assigned via IVRS/IWRS to each \nsubject at the time that informed consent is obtained and this subject number will be used \nthroughout the study.\n9.1.2\nDemographics, Medical History, and Medication History Procedure\nDemographic information to be obtained will include date of birth, sex, Hispanic ethnicity, race as \ndescribed by the subject, height, weight, alcohol use, and smoking status of the subject at \nScreening.\nA complete medical, CV, and social history, will be obtained at Screening (at the time of informed \nconsent). The general medical history will include a review of all major organ systems. The social \nhistory will include tobacco and alcohol use. The CV history will include CV medications and \ndetailed history of prior CV procedures and/or events that stopped. Ongoing conditions are \nconsidered concurrent medical conditions (see Section 9.1.7).\nSubjects will also be asked about their gout disease history, including frequency of acute gout \nattacks and the related symptoms experienced.\nMedication history information to be obtained includes any medication stopped at or within \n30 days prior to the Screening Visit, and will be documented in the subject\u2019s source documents and \non the appropriate eCRF. Prior NSAID and aspirin use will be collected for the year prior to \ninformed consent.\n9.1.3\nPhysical Examination Procedure\nA complete physical examination (defined as the pretreatment assessment immediately prior to the \nstart of study medication) will consist of the following body systems: (1) eyes; (2) ears, nose, \nthroat; (3) CV system; (4) respiratory system; (5) gastrointestinal system; (6) dermatologic \nsystem; (7) extremities; (8) musculoskeletal system; (9) nervous system; (10) lymph nodes; and \n(11) genitourinary system (optional) and (12) other. All subsequent physical examinations should \nassess clinically significant changes from the baseline examination. A complete physical \nexamination will be performed at Day 1, Month 12, and annually until End of Study/DoT/Early \nTermination.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 49 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n9.1.4\nWeight and Height Procedure\nThe subject\u2019s body weight will be collected (in kilograms) at Screening and End of \nStudy/DoT/Early Termination. The subject\u2019s height will be collected at Screening. A subject \nshould have weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and with shoes off.\n9.1.5\nVital Sign Procedure\nVital signs will be obtained at every scheduled clinic visit (Appendix A). Vital sign \nmeasurements include: body temperature (oral), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood \npressure), and pulse/beats per minute (bpm). Measurements will be made prior to dosing where \napplicable. One measurement of blood pressure and pulse will be measured while subjects are in a \nsitting position after they have been seated for at least 5 minutes and in accordance with American \nHeart Association guidelines (arm supported heart level, proper cuff size, etc).\n9.1.6\nDocumentation of Concomitant Medications\nAt each study visit, subjects will be asked whether they have taken any medication other than the \nstudy medication (used from Screening through End of Study/DoT/Early Termination), and all \nmedication, including vitamin supplements, over-the-counter medications, and oral herbal \npreparations must be recorded in the eCRF, along with Reason for Use. Changes in medication for \nsubjects that have discontinued treatment but remain in follow-up should be recorded on the \nMedication Information Obtained During Follow-up Contact eCRF, and not on the Concomitant \nMedications eCRF.\n9.1.7\nDocumentation of Concurrent Medical Conditions\nConcurrent medical conditions are those significant ongoing conditions or diseases that are present \nat Screening (at time of informed consent). This includes clinically significant laboratory, ECG, or \nphysical examination abnormalities. The condition (ie, diagnosis) should be described, and the \ndate that the condition began should be documented.\n9.1.8\nProcedures for Clinical Laboratory Samples\nLaboratory samples will be taken at the time points stipulated in the Schedule of Study Procedures \n(Appendix A). All samples will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures. \nDetails of these procedures and required safety monitoring will be given in the laboratory manual.\n",

Any medication treatment and any sponsor-supplied drug should be \nimmediately discontinued.\nIf the pregnancy occurs during administration of active study medication, (eg, after Screening or \nwithin 30 days of the last dose of study medication) the pregnancy should be reported \nimmediately, using a pregnancy notification form, to the contact listed in Section 1.1.\nShould the pregnancy occur during or after administration of blinded drug, the investigator must \ninform the subject of her right to receive treatment information. If the subject chooses to receive \nunblinded treatment information, the individual blind should be broken by the investigator.\nIf the subject agrees to the primary care physician being informed, the investigator should notify \nthe subject\u2019s primary care physician that she was participating in a clinical study at the time she \nbecame pregnant and provide details of treatment the subject received (blinded or unblinded, as \napplicable).\nAll reported pregnancies will be followed up to final outcome, using the pregnancy form. The \noutcome, including any premature termination, must be reported to the sponsor.\n9.1.10 ECG Procedure\nA standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed and recorded at the Day 1 and End \nof Study/ DoT/Early Termination, using the site\u2019s ECG equipment. The investigator will interpret \nthe ECG using one of the following categories: within normal limits, abnormal but not clinically \nsignificant, or abnormal and clinically significant. Paper copies of the ECG tracings will be \nincluded in each subject\u2019s source document and details of the findings will be captured in the \nsource and eCRF. For subjects who experience a CV AE that potentially meets the predefined \nMACE criteria, all available ECG tracings must be forwarded to the sponsor, along with all ECGs \nassociated with the AE.\n9.1.11 Documentation of Screen Failure\nInvestigators must account for all subjects who sign the informed consent form.\nIf the subject is found to be ineligible at the Screening Visit, and they have not taken a dose of \nprophylaxis medication, the site personnel should complete the screen failure eCRF. The \nIVRS/IWRS should be contacted as a notification of screen failure, and the primary reason for \nscreen failure should be recorded in the eCRF.\nThe primary reason for screen failure is recorded using the following categories:\n\uf0b7\nPretreatment event/AE.\n\uf0b7\nDid not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria (specific inclusion/exclusion \ncriteria should be recorded in the eCRF).\n\uf0b7\nMajor protocol deviation.\n\uf0b7\nLost to follow-up.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 52 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\uf0b7\nVoluntary withdrawal of the consent (The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be \nrecorded in the eCRF).\n\uf0b7\nStudy termination.\n\uf0b7\nPregnancy.\n\uf0b7\nOther (The specific reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF).\nSubject numbers assigned to subjects who fail screening should not be reused.\n9.1.12 Documentation of Washout Failure\nIf the subject signs the informed consent, and takes at least one dose of prophylaxis medication, \nbut does not randomize to double-blind study medication, they are considered a washout failure. \nThe primary reason for washout failure is recorded using the following categories:\n\uf0b7\nPretreatment event/AE.\n\uf0b7\nDid not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria (The specific inclusion criteria \nnot met or the specific exclusion criteria met should be recorded in the eCRF.)\n\uf0b7\nMajor protocol deviation.\n\uf0b7\nLost to follow-up.\n\uf0b7\nVoluntary withdrawal of the consent (The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be \nrecorded in the eCRF.)\n\uf0b7\nStudy termination.\n\uf0b7\nPregnancy.\n\uf0b7\nOther (The specific reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF.)\n9.1.13 Documentation of Study Entrance/Randomization\nOnly subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible \nfor randomization into the treatment phase.\nIf the subject is found to be ineligible for randomization the investigator should record the primary \nreason for failure on the applicable eCRF.\n9.1.14 Gout Flare Prophylaxis\nAll subjects will remain on gout flare prophylaxis for the first 6 months of the study.\nSubjects currently on ULT will discontinue these treatments at the Day -7 Screening Visit, and \nwill begin taking colchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis.\nSubjects not currently taking ULT will begin taking colchicine 0.6 mg QD at the \nDay 1/Randomization Visit.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 53 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nAlternatively, if colchicine is not tolerated by the subject and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min \nthey will be administered naproxen 250 mg BID with lansoprazole 15 mg QD.\nIn instances when subjects should not receive colchicine or naproxen, other NSAIDs or prednisone \nmay be provided at the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated guidelines listed \nunder Excluded Medications and Treatments (Section 7.3.2). In the event that colchicine, \nnaproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or prednisone are not tolerated or are \ncontraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage the subject\u2019s \ngout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by the subject, \n0.6 mg every other day may be used.\nProphylaxis medication is only provided until the Month 6 visit, but upon the Investigator\u2019s \nrequest, continued prescription may be allowed. Please note that study prescription cards intended \nto pay for acute gout flare medication cannot be used to pay for ongoing prophylaxis medication.\n9.1.15 Treatment of Gout Flares\nSubjects who experience a gout flare and who are taking colchicine for prophylaxis and have taken \ntheir daily dose, may take an additional colchicine 0.6 mg tablet at the onset of the flare, with \nanother tablet one hour later, for a maximum of 3 tablets (1.8 mg) in a 24 hour period. After \n12 hours, the original prophylaxis dose may be resumed [12].\nSubjects experiencing a gout flare and who are taking naproxen for prophylaxis, may take \nnaproxen 500 mg BID (2 additional doses of naproxen 250 mg) on the day the gout flare starts \nfollowed by 1 additional 250 mg dose on each subsequent day until the flare subsides. Gout flares \nmay also be treated at the discretion of the investigator, as long as this treatment is in compliance \nwith the prohibited medications for this study.\nAt the Day -7 Screening Visit in addition to dispensing the gout flare prophylaxis, the investigator \nshould provide the subject with a prescription for an anti-inflammatory/analgesic agent of the \ninvestigator\u2019s choosing, to be used in the event the subject experiences a gout flare during the \nstudy and an increase of the prophylaxis medication dose is not efficacious in treating the flare. \nThis may be done at the discretion of the investigator and in accordance with their practice \nguidelines.\nSubjects are to be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as they begin to have a gout flare. \nAn unscheduled visit can be conducted if deemed appropriate by the investigator. All subjects that \nexperience flares while on the study will have the option to receive acute gout flare treatment if \ndeemed appropriate by the principal investigator. The investigator may also consult with the \nTakeda Medical Monitor for further discussion. A Gout Flare Assessment Worksheet (sample \nshown in Appendix G) will be used to collect the gout flare information.\n9.1.16 Gout Flare Assessment\nSubjects will be assessed for gout flares beginning at the Day -7 Screening Visit and throughout \nthe duration of the study. Subjects are to be instructed to call the investigator as soon as they think \nthey may be having a gout flare. The Gout Flare Assessment Worksheet, developed with \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 54 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDrs. Schumacher, Gaffo, Saag and Singh [13] (sample shown in Appendix G) will be completed \nby the site personnel (ie, study coordinator, study nurse, or the investigator).\nAll gout flares should be followed until complete resolution. Subjects should be instructed to \ncontact the site when the flare has resolved (typically 7-10 days after onset). The study site will \ncontact the subject 7 days after the initial report if the subject fails to report the end date of the gout \nflare. The attempts to contact the subject to obtain the end date of the gout flare must be \ndocumented (2 documented telephone contact attempts).\nSubjects will be instructed to report the following information: the onset and end date of the flare, \nthe kind of prophylaxis medication they are taking at the time of the event, whether or not the \nattack required medication (including type) and dates of treatment, the location of the flare, signs \nand symptoms regarding the flare including: swelling, redness, tenderness and joint warmth the \nworst pain of the gout flare (pain at rest), the assessment of current gout flare compared with all \nprevious gout flares in any joints. The investigator will review the information provided and assess \nwhether or not they believe the subject experienced a gout flare and/or document an alternative \netiology.\nThe Gout Flare Assessment Worksheet will be maintained with the subject\u2019s source documents. \nAll confirmed gout flares will be transcribed from the worksheet onto the Gout Flare eCRF page. \nThese entries should not to be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF (unless they meet SAE \ncriteria). If the investigator feels it is appropriate, an unscheduled visit may be scheduled.\n9.1.17 Physical Assessment of Tophi\nSubjects will be assessed for the presence of tophi by palpation at the Day 1 visit. The most easily \nidentified and palpable tophus will be designated as \u201cprimary\u201d and the presence or absence of this \ntophus should be assessed annually and at the End of Study/DoT/Early Termination visit. In \naddition, all tophi will be counted and the number recorded on the Tophi eCRF page at all tophi \nassessment visits.\n9.1.18 Rash Assessment\nAEs of rash will be collected beginning at the Day -7 Visit until 30 days after study medication is \ndiscontinued. AEs of rash will be documented on the Rash Adverse Event Worksheet (sample \nshown in Appendix F) that will be maintained with the subject\u2019s source documents. Rash AEs \nrecorded on the Rash Adverse Event Worksheet will be transcribed over to the Adverse Event \neCRF. So long as the event is not deemed a SAE, the completed Rash Adverse Event Worksheet \nwill be faxed to Takeda, in accordance with the instructions on the worksheet, within 48 hours of \nthe site\u2019s knowledge of the event. If the event is deemed a serious adverse event, follow procedure \nin 10.2.2.\n9.1.19 Management, Withdrawal and Follow-Up of Subjects With Liver Enzyme Elevations\nIf the ALT or AST value rises to >3\u00d7ULN, laboratory tests (at minimum, serum alkaline \nphosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and INR) should be repeated within 48 to 72 hours. If the \nALT or AST value remains elevated >3\u00d7ULN when repeated, and this observation cannot be \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 55 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nexplained by concomitant disease or another alternative etiology, the abnormality must be \nrecorded as an AE, if it has not already. In these cases, additional tests are required to rule out other \netiologies. The investigator must contact the Takeda Medical Monitor for determination of \nadditional testing, consideration of immediate discontinuation of study medication, discussion of \nthe relevant subject details, and possible alternative etiologies.\nIn addition, study medication should be temporarily discontinued with appropriate clinical \nfollow-up, including repeat laboratory tests, until a subject\u2019s laboratory profile has returned to \nnormal, if the following circumstances occur at any time during study medication treatment phase:\n\uf0b7\nALT or AST >8\u00d7ULN, or\n\uf0b7\nALT or AST >5\u00d7ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks, or\n\uf0b7\nALT or AST >3\u00d7ULN in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin >2\u00d7ULN or INR >1.5, or\n\uf0b7\nALT or AST >3\u00d7ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain \nor tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%).\nSubjects who experience ALT or AST >3\u00d7ULN in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin \n>2\u00d7ULN and who also satisfy one of the following criteria should be permanently discontinued \nfrom the study medication treatment phase:\n\uf0b7\nThe liver injury is hepatocellular in nature and there is not a prominent cholestatic component; \nor\n\uf0b7\nThere is no more likely alternative cause than drug induced liver injury, such as acute viral \nhepatitis A or B, or other acute liver disease.\nAdditional information will be collected in the eCRF for liver enzyme AEs that cannot be \nexplained by concomitant disease. This information will include recent history (if any), of alcohol \nuse, blood transfusions, occupational/toxic exposure, tattooing, recreational drug use, special diet, \nsurgery/general anesthesia, travel, or use of herbal supplements or teas. This information will also \ninclude signs and symptoms (if any) associated with the AE and results of any additional \ndiagnostic tests performed.\n9.2\nMonitoring Subject Compliance\nSubjects will be required to bring study medication containers to each clinic visit, regardless of\nwhether the study medication container is empty.\nIf a subject is persistently noncompliant with the sponsor-supplied double blind study drugs\n(<80% or >120% of the allocated medication for the period since the last visit) it may be \nappropriate to withdraw the subject from the study medication treatment and continue in the study \nto monitor for potential CV events. All subjects should be reinstructed about the dosing \nrequirement during study visits. The authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must \ndocument the process in the subject source records.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 56 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n9.3\nSchedule of Observations and Procedures\nThe schedule for all study-related procedures for all evaluations is shown in Appendix A. \nAssessments should be completed at the designated visit/time point(s). Study days/weeks and visit \nwindows should be calculated after randomization and should be calculated from the day of the \nfirst dose of double-blind treatment (Day 1).\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of the predefined MACE; the study \nwill end when the required number of events has accrued. The duration of the study is expected to \nbe 9 years. The length of study participation for each subject will vary (due to the event driven \nstudy design).\nSubjects are required to bring all of the Sponsor supplied medication to every visit.\n9.3.1\nScreening\nSubjects will be evaluated for enrollment based on all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects will be \nevaluated for enrollment based on their prior history of a major CV or cerebrovascular event. \nSubjects currently receiving ULT will begin the 7 day washout and should receive prophylaxis \nmedication.\nIf a subject has a gout flare at the Screening Visit, the visit procedures should be delayed and the \nsubject should be treated for the gout flare and return to the study site no earlier than 2, but no later \nthan 3, weeks after the resolution of the flare. Please contact the Medical Monitor if randomization \ndoes not occur within four weeks of the Screening visit. Screening may be less than 7 days for \nsubjects not washing off of ULTs.

This additional test should occur no earlier than two weeks \nbut no later than three weeks after the initial test.\n9.3.2\nStudy Randomization\nStudy Randomization will take place on Day 1. If the subject has satisfied all of the inclusion \ncriteria and none of the exclusion criteria for randomization, the subject should be randomized \nusing the IVRS/IWRS, as described in Section 8.4. Subjects will be asked to take the first dose of \nstudy medication in the office after randomization, as described in Section 8.4. The procedure for \ndocumenting Screening failures is provided in Section 9.1.11.\nIf a subject has a gout flare at the Randomization (Day 1) Visit, the visit procedures should be \ndelayed and the subject should be treated for the gout flare and return to the study site no earlier \nthan 2 but no later than 3 weeks after the resolution of the flare. If the subject had a flare that started \nafter the screening visit, the randomization visit procedures should be delayed until no earlier than \n2 but no later than 3 weeks after the resolution of the flare.\nThe following procedures will be performed and documented during Study Randomization:\n\uf0b7\nReview of inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\uf0b7\nAccess IVRS/IWRS and dispense assigned study medication with dosing instructions.\n\uf0b7\nPhysical examination.\n\uf0b7\nCollect vital signs.\n\uf0b7\nTophus assessment (includes primary tophus assessment and counting of all other tophi).\n\uf0b7\nCollect laboratory assessments (fasting if at all possible, however if the subject is not fasting \ncontinue with visit).\n\uf0b7\n12-lead ECG.\n\uf0b7\nAssess for pretreatment events.\n\uf0b7\nAEs assessment.\n\uf0b7\nGout flare assessment.\n\uf0b7\nConcomitant medication assessment.\n\uf0b7\nDispense prophylaxis medication, with dosing instructions (for subjects not taking ULTs at \nScreening).\n\uf0b7\nEducate subject on reporting of potential CV events and gout flares.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 58 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\uf0b7\nAssess compliance of prophylaxis medication and re-dispense (for subjects discontinuing prior \nULT at Day -7).\n\uf0b7\nVerify subject\u2019s contact information (including details of emergency contact).\n\uf0b7\nReview the Retention Program (subjects in the US and Canada only).

(Intermittent \nevents for pre-existing conditions or underlying disease should be not considered PTEs or \nAEs).\n\uf0b7\nNecessitate therapeutic intervention.\n\uf0b7\nRequire an invasive diagnostic procedure.\n\uf0b7\nRequire discontinuation or a change in dose of study medication or a concomitant medication.\n\uf0b7\nBe considered unfavorable by the investigator for any reason.\nDiagnoses versus signs and symptoms:\n\uf0b7\nEach event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including \nabnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as \nadditional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded \nappropriately as a pretreatment event(s) or as an AE(s).\nLaboratory values and ECG findings:\n\uf0b7\nChanges in laboratory values or ECG parameters are only considered to be pretreatment events \nor AEs if they are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervention is \nrequired or if the investigator judges the change to be beyond the range of normal physiologic \nfluctuation). A laboratory retest and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value are not \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 65 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nconsidered an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for \nverification, evaluation or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an intervention.\n\uf0b7\nIf abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an \noverall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be \nreported appropriately as a pretreatment event or as an AE.\n\uf0b7\nIf the ALT or AST value rises to >3\u00d7ULN, laboratory tests (at minimum, serum alkaline \nphosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and INR) should be repeated within 48 to 72 hours. If \nthe ALT or AST value remains elevated >3\u00d7ULN when repeated, and this observation cannot \nbe explained by concomitant disease or another alternative etiology, the abnormality must be \nrecorded as an AE, if it has not already.\n\uf0b7\nPre-existing conditions: Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing of informed \nconsent) are considered concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as \npretreatment events or AEs. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication \nof such a concurrent condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded \nappropriately as a pretreatment event (worsening or complication occurs before start of study \nmedication) or an AE (worsening or complication occurs after start of study medication). \nInvestigators should ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condition \n(eg, \u201dworsening of\u2026\u201d).\n\uf0b7\nIf a subject has a pre-existing episodic condition (eg, asthma, epilepsy) any occurrence of an \nepisode should only be captured as a PTE/AE if the episodes become more frequent, serious or \nsevere in nature, that is, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the \nchange in the condition from Baseline (eg, \u201cworsening of\u2026\u201d)\n\uf0b7\nIf a subject has a degenerative concurrent condition (eg, cataracts), worsening of the condition \nshould only be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater extent to that which would be \nexpected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in \nthe condition (eg, \u201cworsening of\u2026\u201d).\nWorsening of pretreatment or AEs:\n\uf0b7\nIf the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a pretreatment event after starting \nadministration of the study medication, the worsening or complication should be recorded \nappropriately as an AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the \nchange in the condition (eg, \u201cworsening of\u2026\u201d).\n\uf0b7\nIf the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in study \nmedication, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators \nshould ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, \u201cworsening \nof\u2026\u201d).\nChanges in severity of AEs/PTEs/SAEs:\n\uf0b7\nIf the subject experiences changes in severity of an AE/PTE/SAE, the event should be captured \nonce with the maximum severity recorded.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 66 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nPreplanned surgeries or procedures:\n\uf0b7\nPreplanned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to signing of \ninformed consent are not considered pretreatment events or AEs. However, if a preplanned \nprocedure is performed early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing \ncondition, the worsening of the condition should be captured appropriately as a pretreatment \nevent or an AE. Complications resulting from any planned surgery should be reported as \nadverse events.\nElective surgeries or procedures:\n\uf0b7\nElective procedures performed where there is no change in the subject\u2019s medical condition \nshould not be recorded as pretreatment events or AEs, but should be documented in the \nsubject\u2019s source documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be \nreported as adverse events.\nInsufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):\n\uf0b7\nInsufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic action, should NOT be recorded as \nan AE. The principal investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of \npre-existing illness and lack of therapeutic efficacy.\nOverdose:\n\uf0b7\nCases of overdose with any medication without manifested side effects are NOT considered \npretreatment events or AEs, but will instead be documented on an Overdose page of the eCRF. \nAny manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE \npage of the eCRF.\n10.1.4 SAEs\nAn SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:\n1. Results in DEATH.\n2. Is LIFE THREATENING.\n\uf0b7\nThe term \u201clife threatening\u201d refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the \ntime of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death \nif it were more severe.\n3. Requires subject HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of existing hospitalization.\n4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.\n5. Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT.\n6.

Approximately 7500 subjects will be randomly assigned to study medication treatment.\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of predefined major cardiovascular events (MACE). The \nlength of study is expected to be approximately 9 years. The length of study participation for each subject will vary \ndue to the event driven study design. This study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE.\nSubjects will be screened at Day -7 for entry. Subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities, gout and (1) a serum urate \nlevel (sUA) \u22657 mg/dL or (2) with a sUA \u22656 mg/dL AND at least 1 flare in the 12 months prior to screening and/or the \npresence of tophi) and who meet the other selection criteria will be enrolled.\nOn Study Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat once daily (QD) or \nallopurinol QD. Randomization will be stratified based on baseline renal function: subjects with normal renal function \nor mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance [eCLcr] \u226560 mL/min) versus subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min).\nSubjects randomized to febuxostat will initially receive the 40 mg dose QD. Subjects will remain on 40 mg for the \nremainder of the study if their sUA is <6.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days). If their sUA is \u22656.0 mg/dL at the \nWeek 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days) they will receive febuxostat 80 mg QD at Week 4 visit (\uf0b13 days), and will remain on this dose \nfor the remainder of the study. No dose adjustment will be made in the febuxostat based on renal function.\nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have normal renal function or mild renal impairment (eCLcr \u226560 mL/min) \nwill initially receive allopurinol 300 mg QD with the dose increased in 100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA \n<6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 600 mg QD is achieved. Subjects randomized to allopurinol who have moderate \nrenal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 200 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 400 mg QD is achieved.\nTo maintain the double-blind nature of the study, febuxostat and allopurinol tablets will be over-encapsulated and \nmatching placebo capsules will be manufactured which are identical in appearance. Subjects will orally self administer \n2 capsules each morning in the appropriate combination for their assigned dose and treatment. For details regarding \nthe appropriate dose combination, please see Section 8.1.3.\nSerum urate levels will be unblinded to the investigator and Takeda through the Week 10 Visit of the study to facilitate \ndose increases based on sUA response. After the Week 10 Visit, sUA measurements will be blinded to Takeda and the \ninvestigator. The interactive voice-activated response system/interactive web-activated response system \n(IVRS/IWRS) will manage the treatment assignment at randomization and throughout the study medication treatment \nperiod.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 12 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nSubjects currently on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) will discontinue treatment at the Day -7 Screening Visit, and will \nbegin colchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis. Subjects not on ULT will begin colchicine 0.6 mg QD on the \nDay 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will receive gout flare prophylaxis for the first six months of the study \nmedication treatment period. Alternatively, if colchicine is not tolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they \nwill be administered naproxen 250 mg twice daily (BID) with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been \nmaintained on an appropriate dose (as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) other \nthan lansoprazole, he/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In instances when subjects should not \nreceive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or prednisone may be provided \nat the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated guidelines listed under the Excluded Medications and \nTreatments section of the protocol. In the event that colchicine, naproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or \nprednisone are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage \nthe subject\u2019s gout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by the subject, 0.6 mg \nevery other day may be used.\nFollowing the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return for study visits during the first 3 months of the study based on the \nsubject\u2019s sUA response. Once a subject sUA <6.0 mg/dL there will be no further visits until Month 3.\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a Week 4 and Month 3 visit. \nIf the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit \nwill occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week \n4, and the next visit will occur at Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be \ndispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 6 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8 and the next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study medication at the Month 3 \nvisit. After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be made. All subjects will have a Month 3 and Month 6 \nvisits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the study. In addition, \nsubjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) and/or subjects who are elderly (\u226565 years of \nage) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor the liver function tests (LFTs). Subjects who are withdrawn \nfrom study medication treatment but have not withdrawn consent will be contacted every 2 months for the duration of \nthe study or until the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE. A Data Monitoring \nCommittee (DMC) unblinded to treatment assignment will periodically review results obtained in the study, including \nresults at 3 planned interim analyses. They will monitor the progress and the ongoing safety of subjects enrolled into \nthe study.

The sample size will \nprovide at least 90% power to meet a noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio (febuxostat relative to \nallopurinol) for the primary endpoint assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0 at a 1-sided 2.5% significance level. For the \ndetermination of noninferiority between the febuxostat treatment group and the allopurinol treatment group, the \nsample size calculation assumed constant proportional hazards and exponential survival curves, annual adjudicated \nMACE composite rate of 2.8%, maximum length of participation of 5 years, accrual time of 2.5 years and annual \ndrop-out rate of 10%. This study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE. These assumptions were used prior to \nthe initiation of the study to calculate the number of subjects to be enrolled in order to obtain the required number of \nMACE.\nStatistical Considerations:\nThe primary endpoint and all other analyses by treatment group will be analyzed according to the randomized \ntreatment using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of all subjects who were randomized and received \nat least one dose of double-blind study medication. If a subject reports a MACE after treatment discontinuation, then \nthe reported event will be counted toward the treatment to which they were randomized.\nSafety Analyses\nAssuming constant proportional hazards, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint will be computed based on \nfebuxostat and allopurinol estimated hazard rates. The febuxostat treatment group will be compared to the allopurinol \ntreatment group to test for non-inferiority in the MACE composite rate using a Cox proportional hazards model with \ntreatment and baseline renal function as factors in the model. Non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol will be \ndeclared at an interim analysis or at the final analysis if the current 1-sided upper CI for the hazard ratio (febuxostat \nversus allopurinol) calculated with critical values obtained using the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending \nfunction, which preserves an overall 1-sided false-rejection rate of 2.5%, is less than 1.3.\nAnalysis of the secondary and other safety endpoints will be conducted similarly using a Cox proportional hazards \nmodel. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.\nAdditional analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using Cox-proportional hazards model \ncontrolling for the effect of NSAIDs use. The model will include treatment group, baseline renal function, and use of \nNSAIDs as explanatory variables. A similar analysis will control for the effect of low-dose aspirin use.\nInterim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination.\nThis study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE for assessing non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to \nallopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0 and 90% power. Interim analyses will \nbe conducted when approximately 25%, 50% and 75% of the events have occurred, followed by a final analysis. At \neach analysis, if the upper one-sided confidence limit of the hazard ratio is less than 1.3, the study will be stopped and \nthe non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk will be declared.\nPeriodically during the course of the study a blinded assessment of the annual adjudicated composite MACE rate will \nbe made. The number of subjects planned to be enrolled in this study was based on an event rate of 2.8%, which was \nbased on limited information. Based on the overall blinded composite MACE rate observed, an assessment will be \nmade to determine whether or not to adjust the number of subjects planned for enrollment.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 16 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n3.0\nSTUDY REFERENCE INFORMATION\n3.1\nStudy-Related Responsibilities\nThe sponsor will perform all study-related activities with the exception of those identified below. \nThe identified vendors will perform these activities in full or in partnership with the sponsor.\nActivity\nUS and Canada\nMexico\nSite Monitoring\nCentral laboratory\nData management\nStatistical analysis\nInteractive voice-activated response \nsystem\nClinical supply packaging and \ndistribution\nClinical supply return\nPPD\nPPD\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 17 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n3.2\nPrincipal Investigator\nTakeda Development Center Americas, Inc.

Gout is a serious health condition characterized by flares of acute arthritis, \nchronic gouty arthropathy, tophi, and uric acid urolithiasis, and is associated with a broad range of \ncomorbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) disease, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic \nsyndrome [4-6]. The underlying metabolic aberration in gout is hyperuricemia, which is defined as \nan elevation in serum uric acid (sUA) level \u22656.8 mg/dL. Hyperuricemia develops into gout when \nurate crystals are formed from supersaturated body fluids and are deposited in joints, tophi, and \nparenchymal organs eliciting acute inflammatory responses.\nUrate-lowering therapy (ULT) is used to treat hyperuricemia in subjects with gout. The goal of \ntherapy is to reduce sUA to 6.0 mg/dL or less, below the concentration at which monosodium urate \nsaturates extracellular fluid. Using ULT to reduce and maintain sUA levels <6.0 mg/dL ultimately \nimproves the clinical symptoms of gout by reducing the frequency of gout flares, decreasing size \nand number of tophi, and improving quality of life. Due to the potential for paradoxical flares \ncaused by urate crystal mobilization, anti-inflammatory agents and/or colchicine are given as \nprophylaxis with ULT during the first 6 months of treatment [7].\nGout subjects also have a high incidence of comorbidities that may be associated with \nhyperuricemia, gout, or both. This is supported by a growing body of literature demonstrating that \nsUA level is an independent predictive factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) when the effects of \nother risk factors have been controlled. Several recent studies report an increased risk of CV death, \nmyocardial infarction (MI), and stroke associated with higher sUA levels. For example, the \nPreventive Cardiology Information System Database Cohort Study, which assessed the prognostic \nvalue of sUA in 3098 persons at risk for CVD, found that sUA was an independent predictor of \ndeath from all causes; for every 1 mg/dL elevation in sUA level, the risk of death from all cause in \nsubjects at high risk of CVD increased by 39% (hazard ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.28-1.50) without \nadjusting for other risk factors. After adjusting for other risk factors, the sUA level remained a \npredictor of death from all causes (hazard ratio=1.26, 95% CI 1.15-1.38) [8]. In the Framingham \nHeart study, sUA was not an independent predictor of coronary artery disease in men without gout, \nbut there was a 60% excess incidence of coronaryartery disease in men with gout never treated \nwith diuretics [9]. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study reported a direct \nrole for hyperuricemia in CV events and mortality, tying sUA levels to increasing CV mortality. \nThese findings persisted even after adjustments were made for age, sex, race, body mass index, \nsmoking, hypertension, and diabetes [10].\n4.1.1\nMechanism of Action\nFebuxostat is a potent, nonpurine, selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO) that exhibits \nantihyperuricemic activity by reducing the formation of uric acid. Uric acid is the end product of \npurine metabolism and is generated in the cascade of hypoxanthine\u2192xanthine\u2192uric acid. Both \nsteps in this transformation are catalyzed by XO. Febuxostat has been shown to potently inhibit \nboth the oxidized and reduced forms of XO. Unlike febuxostat, administration of allopurinol does \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 21 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nnot provide persistent enzyme inhibition and has weaker hypouricemic activity. More importantly, \nbecause allopurinol and its metabolites are purine analogs, they also inhibit other enzymes \ninvolved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. In contrast, febuxostat is a selective inhibitor of \nXO.\n4.1.2\nNonclinical Data Summary\nRelevant CV related nonclinical data are summarized below.\nFebuxostat is a nonpurine, selective inhibitor of XO that inhibits the formation of uric acid from \nhypoxanthine and xanthine. XO inhibition is not known to cause CV adverse effects.\nNonclinical safety pharmacology and secondary pharmacology studies demonstrated no \nmechanisms associating febuxostat with CV effects at therapeutic exposures. CV safety \npharmacology studies included in vitro electrophysiology investigation on cardiac action potential \nparameters and ion channels (potassium [human ether-\u00e0-go-go\u2013related gene], sodium, and \ncalcium), and in vivo studies for hemodynamic and electrocardiogram (ECG) effects in both \nanesthetized and conscious telemetry-monitored dogs. In addition, the in vitro effects of \nfebuxostat on the hemostatic system, protease generation, and platelet function were explored \nusing human blood. Febuxostat did not significantly inhibit nor augment platelet or coagulation \nresponses and did not have any interactions in vitro with heparin, warfarin, or aspirin.\nFurthermore, in a long-term (52-week) toxicology study in dogs, no CV toxicity was observed \nbased on electrocardiographic, organ weight, and histopathological examinations.\nFebuxostat was also shown to have no detrimental CV effects in animal CV models. Overall, when \nstudied in 6 different animal models specific for CV diseases, febuxostat had no detrimental CV \neffect, but rather appeared to have beneficial CV effects. In summary, no biological mechanism \nwas identified to be associated with febuxostat that could cause potential CV adverse effects.\n4.2\nRATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED STUDY\nThe febuxostat Phase 3 randomized controlled studies revealed a small number of cardiovascular \nthromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions and non-fatal \nstrokes) in subjects treated with febuxostat (0.74 per 100 PY with 95% CI 0.36-1.37) compared to \nallopurinol (0.60 per 100 PY with 95% CI 0.16-1.53). In the phase 3 clinical program for \nfebuxostat approximately 60% of subjects had 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors (including \ndiabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking).\nIn order to further explore the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat, Takeda has committed to \nconduct a randomized, controlled trial of adequate size and duration to determine whether the use \nof febuxostat is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular \noutcomes as compared to allopurinol.\nThis study will enroll subjects with a high cardiovascular risk profile, characterized by the \npresence of documented history of any of the following: cerebrovascular, coronary, peripheral \nvascular disease, or the diagnosis of diabetes with microvascular or macrovascular complications. \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 22 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nThis randomized controlled study will attempt to enroll populations of interest including women \n(5%), elderly (20%) and renally impaired (30%).\nThe primary endpoint of the study will be a pre-defined composite of major adverse cardiovascular \nevents (MACE).

Approximately 7500 subjects will be randomly assigned to study \nmedication treatment.\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of predefined MACE. The length of \nstudy is expected to be approximately 9 years. The length of study participation for each subject \nwill vary due to the event driven study design. This study is designed to have a maximum of \n624 MACE.\nSubjects will be screened at Day -7 for entry. Subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities, gout and \n(1) a sUA \u22657 mg/dL or (2) with a sUA \u22656 mg/dL AND at least one flare in the 12 months prior to \nscreening and/or the presence of tophi) and who meet the other selection criteria will be enrolled.\nOn Study Day 1/Randomization Visit, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive \neither febuxostat once daily (QD) or allopurinol QD. Randomization will be stratified based on \nbaseline renal function: subjects with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated \ncreatinine clearance [(eCLcr) \u226560 mL/min] versus subjects with moderate renal impairment \n[eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min]).\nSubjects randomized to febuxostat will initially receive the 40 mg dose QD. Subjects will remain \non 40 mg remainder of the study if their sUA is <6.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days). If their \nsUA is \u22656.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days) they will receive febuxostat 80 mg QD at Week \n4 visit (\uf0b13 days), and will remain on this dose for the remainder of the study. No dose adjustment \nwill be made in the febuxostat based on renal function.\nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have normal renal function or mild renal impairment \n(eCLcr \u226560 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 300 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 600 mg QD is \nachieved. Subjects randomized to allopurinol who have moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \n\u226530 but <60 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 200 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 400 mg QD is \nachieved.\nTo maintain the double-blind nature of the study, febuxostat and allopurinol tablets will be \nover-encapsulated and matching placebo capsules will be manufactured which are identical in \nappearance. Subjects will orally self administer 2 capsules each morning in the appropriate \ncombination for their assigned dose and treatment. For details regarding the appropriate dose \ncombination, please see Section 8.1.3.\nSerum urate levels will be unblinded to the investigator and Takeda through the Week 10 Visit of \nthe study to facilitate dose increases based on sUA response. After the Week 10 Visit, sUA \nmeasurements will be blinded to Takeda and the investigator. The interactive voice-activated \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 26 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nresponse system/interactive web-activated response system (IVRS/IWRS) will manage the \ntreatment assignment at randomization and throughout the study medication treatment period.\nSubjects currently on ULT will discontinue treatment at the Day -7 Screening Visit, and will begin \ncolchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis. Subjects not on ULT will begin colchicine \n0.6 mg QD on the Day 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will receive gout flare prophylaxis for \nthe first six months of the study medication treatment period. Alternatively, if colchicine is not \ntolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they will be administered naproxen 250 mg twice \ndaily (BID) with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been maintained on an appropriate dose \n(as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) other than lansoprazole, \nhe/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In instances when subjects should not \nreceive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or \nprednisone may be provided at the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated \nguidelines listed under the Excluded Medications and Treatments section of the protocol. In the \nevent that colchicine, naproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or prednisone are not \ntolerated or are contraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage \nthe subject\u2019s gout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by \nthe subject, 0.6 mg every other day may be used. Following the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return for \nstudy visits during the first 3 months of the study based on the subject\u2019s sUA response. Once a \nsubject sUA <6.0 mg/dL there will be no further visits until Month 3 (Figure 6.b).\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a \nWeek 4 and Month 3 visit. If the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed \nstudy medication at Week 4, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit will occur \nat Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the \nsubject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If \nthe Week 6 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8 and \nthe next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study \nmedication at the Month 3 visit.

Approximately 7500 subjects will be randomly assigned to study medication treatment.\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of predefined major cardiovascular events (MACE). The \nlength of study is expected to be approximately 9 years. The length of study participation for each subject will vary \ndue to the event driven study design. This study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE.\nSubjects will be screened at Day -7 for entry. Subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities, gout and (1) a serum urate \nlevel (sUA) \u22657 mg/dL or (2) with a sUA \u22656 mg/dL AND at least 1 flare in the 12 months prior to screening and/or the \npresence of tophi) and who meet the other selection criteria will be enrolled.\nOn Study Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat once daily (QD) or \nallopurinol QD. Randomization will be stratified based on baseline renal function: subjects with normal renal function \nor mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance [eCLcr] \u226560 mL/min) versus subjects with moderate renal \nimpairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min).\nSubjects randomized to febuxostat will initially receive the 40 mg dose QD. Subjects will remain on 40 mg for the \nremainder of the study if their sUA is <6.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days). If their sUA is \u22656.0 mg/dL at the \nWeek 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days) they will receive febuxostat 80 mg QD at Week 4 visit (\uf0b13 days), and will remain on this dose \nfor the remainder of the study. No dose adjustment will be made in the febuxostat based on renal function.\nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have normal renal function or mild renal impairment (eCLcr \u226560 mL/min) \nwill initially receive allopurinol 300 mg QD with the dose increased in 100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA \n<6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 600 mg QD is achieved. Subjects randomized to allopurinol who have moderate \nrenal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 200 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 400 mg QD is achieved.\nTo maintain the double-blind nature of the study, febuxostat and allopurinol tablets will be over-encapsulated and \nmatching placebo capsules will be manufactured which are identical in appearance. Subjects will orally self administer \n2 capsules each morning in the appropriate combination for their assigned dose and treatment. For details regarding \nthe appropriate dose combination, please see Section 8.1.3.\nSerum urate levels will be unblinded to the investigator and Takeda through the Week 10 Visit of the study to facilitate \ndose increases based on sUA response. After the Week 10 Visit, sUA measurements will be blinded to Takeda and the \ninvestigator. The interactive voice-activated response system/interactive web-activated response system \n(IVRS/IWRS) will manage the treatment assignment at randomization and throughout the study medication treatment \nperiod.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 12 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nSubjects currently on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) will discontinue treatment at the Day -7 Screening Visit, and will \nbegin colchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis. Subjects not on ULT will begin colchicine 0.6 mg QD on the \nDay 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will receive gout flare prophylaxis for the first six months of the study \nmedication treatment period. Alternatively, if colchicine is not tolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they \nwill be administered naproxen 250 mg twice daily (BID) with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been \nmaintained on an appropriate dose (as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) other \nthan lansoprazole, he/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In instances when subjects should not \nreceive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or prednisone may be provided \nat the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated guidelines listed under the Excluded Medications and \nTreatments section of the protocol. In the event that colchicine, naproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or \nprednisone are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage \nthe subject\u2019s gout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by the subject, 0.6 mg \nevery other day may be used.\nFollowing the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return for study visits during the first 3 months of the study based on the \nsubject\u2019s sUA response. Once a subject sUA <6.0 mg/dL there will be no further visits until Month 3.\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a Week 4 and Month 3 visit. \nIf the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit \nwill occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week \n4, and the next visit will occur at Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be \ndispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 6 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8 and the next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study medication at the Month 3 \nvisit. After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be made. All subjects will have a Month 3 and Month 6 \nvisits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the study. In addition, \nsubjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) and/or subjects who are elderly (\u226565 years of \nage) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor the liver function tests (LFTs). Subjects who are withdrawn \nfrom study medication treatment but have not withdrawn consent will be contacted every 2 months for the duration of \nthe study or until the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE. A Data Monitoring \nCommittee (DMC) unblinded to treatment assignment will periodically review results obtained in the study, including \nresults at 3 planned interim analyses. They will monitor the progress and the ongoing safety of subjects enrolled into \nthe study. An Independent CV Endpoints Committee will prospectively review all suspected serious CV events using \nblinded data. All investigational sites will be required to collect relevant clinical information required for adjudication \nof all deaths and potential CV SAEs.\nPrimary Objective:\nThe objective of this study is to compare the risk of predefined MACE during treatment with febuxostat and \nallopurinol in subjects with gout and CV comorbidities.\nSubject Population:\nMale subjects \u226550 years of age and female subjects \u226555 years of age and at least 2-years post-menopausal with gout \nand a prior history of major CV or cerebrovascular disease.\nNumber of Subjects:\nEstimated total of 7500 subjects:\n3750 subjects randomized to febuxostat\n3750 subjects randomized to allopurinol\nNumber of Sites:\nApproximately 465 sites (United States, Canada, and \nMexico)\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 13 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDose Level(s):\nFebuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg QD\nAllopurinol 200 mg to 600 mg QD in 100 mg increments\nRoute of Administration:\nOral\nDuration of Treatment:\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number \nof predefined MACE; however, the maximum length of \nparticipation is expected to be approximately 9 years.

The sample size will \nprovide at least 90% power to meet a noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio (febuxostat relative to \nallopurinol) for the primary endpoint assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0 at a 1-sided 2.5% significance level. For the \ndetermination of noninferiority between the febuxostat treatment group and the allopurinol treatment group, the \nsample size calculation assumed constant proportional hazards and exponential survival curves, annual adjudicated \nMACE composite rate of 2.8%, maximum length of participation of 5 years, accrual time of 2.5 years and annual \ndrop-out rate of 10%. This study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE. These assumptions were used prior to \nthe initiation of the study to calculate the number of subjects to be enrolled in order to obtain the required number of \nMACE.\nStatistical Considerations:\nThe primary endpoint and all other analyses by treatment group will be analyzed according to the randomized \ntreatment using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of all subjects who were randomized and received \nat least one dose of double-blind study medication. If a subject reports a MACE after treatment discontinuation, then \nthe reported event will be counted toward the treatment to which they were randomized.\nSafety Analyses\nAssuming constant proportional hazards, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint will be computed based on \nfebuxostat and allopurinol estimated hazard rates. The febuxostat treatment group will be compared to the allopurinol \ntreatment group to test for non-inferiority in the MACE composite rate using a Cox proportional hazards model with \ntreatment and baseline renal function as factors in the model. Non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol will be \ndeclared at an interim analysis or at the final analysis if the current 1-sided upper CI for the hazard ratio (febuxostat \nversus allopurinol) calculated with critical values obtained using the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending \nfunction, which preserves an overall 1-sided false-rejection rate of 2.5%, is less than 1.3.\nAnalysis of the secondary and other safety endpoints will be conducted similarly using a Cox proportional hazards \nmodel. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.\nAdditional analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using Cox-proportional hazards model \ncontrolling for the effect of NSAIDs use. The model will include treatment group, baseline renal function, and use of \nNSAIDs as explanatory variables. A similar analysis will control for the effect of low-dose aspirin use.\nInterim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination.\nThis study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE for assessing non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to \nallopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0 and 90% power. Interim analyses will \nbe conducted when approximately 25%, 50% and 75% of the events have occurred, followed by a final analysis. At \neach analysis, if the upper one-sided confidence limit of the hazard ratio is less than 1.3, the study will be stopped and \nthe non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk will be declared.\nPeriodically during the course of the study a blinded assessment of the annual adjudicated composite MACE rate will \nbe made. The number of subjects planned to be enrolled in this study was based on an event rate of 2.8%, which was \nbased on limited information. Based on the overall blinded composite MACE rate observed, an assessment will be \nmade to determine whether or not to adjust the number of subjects planned for enrollment.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 16 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n3.0\nSTUDY REFERENCE INFORMATION\n3.1\nStudy-Related Responsibilities\nThe sponsor will perform all study-related activities with the exception of those identified below. \nThe identified vendors will perform these activities in full or in partnership with the sponsor.\nActivity\nUS and Canada\nMexico\nSite Monitoring\nCentral laboratory\nData management\nStatistical analysis\nInteractive voice-activated response \nsystem\nClinical supply packaging and \ndistribution\nClinical supply return\nPPD\nPPD\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 17 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n3.2\nPrincipal Investigator\nTakeda Development Center Americas, Inc.

Gout is a serious health condition characterized by flares of acute arthritis, \nchronic gouty arthropathy, tophi, and uric acid urolithiasis, and is associated with a broad range of \ncomorbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) disease, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic \nsyndrome [4-6]. The underlying metabolic aberration in gout is hyperuricemia, which is defined as \nan elevation in serum uric acid (sUA) level \u22656.8 mg/dL. Hyperuricemia develops into gout when \nurate crystals are formed from supersaturated body fluids and are deposited in joints, tophi, and \nparenchymal organs eliciting acute inflammatory responses.\nUrate-lowering therapy (ULT) is used to treat hyperuricemia in subjects with gout. The goal of \ntherapy is to reduce sUA to 6.0 mg/dL or less, below the concentration at which monosodium urate \nsaturates extracellular fluid. Using ULT to reduce and maintain sUA levels <6.0 mg/dL ultimately \nimproves the clinical symptoms of gout by reducing the frequency of gout flares, decreasing size \nand number of tophi, and improving quality of life. Due to the potential for paradoxical flares \ncaused by urate crystal mobilization, anti-inflammatory agents and/or colchicine are given as \nprophylaxis with ULT during the first 6 months of treatment [7].\nGout subjects also have a high incidence of comorbidities that may be associated with \nhyperuricemia, gout, or both. This is supported by a growing body of literature demonstrating that \nsUA level is an independent predictive factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) when the effects of \nother risk factors have been controlled. Several recent studies report an increased risk of CV death, \nmyocardial infarction (MI), and stroke associated with higher sUA levels. For example, the \nPreventive Cardiology Information System Database Cohort Study, which assessed the prognostic \nvalue of sUA in 3098 persons at risk for CVD, found that sUA was an independent predictor of \ndeath from all causes; for every 1 mg/dL elevation in sUA level, the risk of death from all cause in \nsubjects at high risk of CVD increased by 39% (hazard ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.28-1.50) without \nadjusting for other risk factors. After adjusting for other risk factors, the sUA level remained a \npredictor of death from all causes (hazard ratio=1.26, 95% CI 1.15-1.38) [8]. In the Framingham \nHeart study, sUA was not an independent predictor of coronary artery disease in men without gout, \nbut there was a 60% excess incidence of coronaryartery disease in men with gout never treated \nwith diuretics [9]. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study reported a direct \nrole for hyperuricemia in CV events and mortality, tying sUA levels to increasing CV mortality. \nThese findings persisted even after adjustments were made for age, sex, race, body mass index, \nsmoking, hypertension, and diabetes [10].\n4.1.1\nMechanism of Action\nFebuxostat is a potent, nonpurine, selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO) that exhibits \nantihyperuricemic activity by reducing the formation of uric acid. Uric acid is the end product of \npurine metabolism and is generated in the cascade of hypoxanthine\u2192xanthine\u2192uric acid. Both \nsteps in this transformation are catalyzed by XO. Febuxostat has been shown to potently inhibit \nboth the oxidized and reduced forms of XO. Unlike febuxostat, administration of allopurinol does \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 21 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nnot provide persistent enzyme inhibition and has weaker hypouricemic activity. More importantly, \nbecause allopurinol and its metabolites are purine analogs, they also inhibit other enzymes \ninvolved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. In contrast, febuxostat is a selective inhibitor of \nXO.\n4.1.2\nNonclinical Data Summary\nRelevant CV related nonclinical data are summarized below.\nFebuxostat is a nonpurine, selective inhibitor of XO that inhibits the formation of uric acid from \nhypoxanthine and xanthine. XO inhibition is not known to cause CV adverse effects.\nNonclinical safety pharmacology and secondary pharmacology studies demonstrated no \nmechanisms associating febuxostat with CV effects at therapeutic exposures. CV safety \npharmacology studies included in vitro electrophysiology investigation on cardiac action potential \nparameters and ion channels (potassium [human ether-\u00e0-go-go\u2013related gene], sodium, and \ncalcium), and in vivo studies for hemodynamic and electrocardiogram (ECG) effects in both \nanesthetized and conscious telemetry-monitored dogs. In addition, the in vitro effects of \nfebuxostat on the hemostatic system, protease generation, and platelet function were explored \nusing human blood. Febuxostat did not significantly inhibit nor augment platelet or coagulation \nresponses and did not have any interactions in vitro with heparin, warfarin, or aspirin.\nFurthermore, in a long-term (52-week) toxicology study in dogs, no CV toxicity was observed \nbased on electrocardiographic, organ weight, and histopathological examinations.\nFebuxostat was also shown to have no detrimental CV effects in animal CV models. Overall, when \nstudied in 6 different animal models specific for CV diseases, febuxostat had no detrimental CV \neffect, but rather appeared to have beneficial CV effects. In summary, no biological mechanism \nwas identified to be associated with febuxostat that could cause potential CV adverse effects.\n4.2\nRATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED STUDY\nThe febuxostat Phase 3 randomized controlled studies revealed a small number of cardiovascular \nthromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions and non-fatal \nstrokes) in subjects treated with febuxostat (0.74 per 100 PY with 95% CI 0.36-1.37) compared to \nallopurinol (0.60 per 100 PY with 95% CI 0.16-1.53). In the phase 3 clinical program for \nfebuxostat approximately 60% of subjects had 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors (including \ndiabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking).\nIn order to further explore the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat, Takeda has committed to \nconduct a randomized, controlled trial of adequate size and duration to determine whether the use \nof febuxostat is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular \noutcomes as compared to allopurinol.\nThis study will enroll subjects with a high cardiovascular risk profile, characterized by the \npresence of documented history of any of the following: cerebrovascular, coronary, peripheral \nvascular disease, or the diagnosis of diabetes with microvascular or macrovascular complications. \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 22 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nThis randomized controlled study will attempt to enroll populations of interest including women \n(5%), elderly (20%) and renally impaired (30%).\nThe primary endpoint of the study will be a pre-defined composite of major adverse cardiovascular \nevents (MACE).

Approximately 7500 subjects will be randomly assigned to study \nmedication treatment.\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of predefined MACE. The length of \nstudy is expected to be approximately 9 years. The length of study participation for each subject \nwill vary due to the event driven study design. This study is designed to have a maximum of \n624 MACE.\nSubjects will be screened at Day -7 for entry. Subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities, gout and \n(1) a sUA \u22657 mg/dL or (2) with a sUA \u22656 mg/dL AND at least one flare in the 12 months prior to \nscreening and/or the presence of tophi) and who meet the other selection criteria will be enrolled.\nOn Study Day 1/Randomization Visit, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive \neither febuxostat once daily (QD) or allopurinol QD. Randomization will be stratified based on \nbaseline renal function: subjects with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated \ncreatinine clearance [(eCLcr) \u226560 mL/min] versus subjects with moderate renal impairment \n[eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min]).\nSubjects randomized to febuxostat will initially receive the 40 mg dose QD. Subjects will remain \non 40 mg remainder of the study if their sUA is <6.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days). If their \nsUA is \u22656.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit (\uf0b13 days) they will receive febuxostat 80 mg QD at Week \n4 visit (\uf0b13 days), and will remain on this dose for the remainder of the study. No dose adjustment \nwill be made in the febuxostat based on renal function.\nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have normal renal function or mild renal impairment \n(eCLcr \u226560 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 300 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 600 mg QD is \nachieved. Subjects randomized to allopurinol who have moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \n\u226530 but <60 mL/min) will initially receive allopurinol 200 mg QD with the dose increased in \n100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 400 mg QD is \nachieved.\nTo maintain the double-blind nature of the study, febuxostat and allopurinol tablets will be \nover-encapsulated and matching placebo capsules will be manufactured which are identical in \nappearance. Subjects will orally self administer 2 capsules each morning in the appropriate \ncombination for their assigned dose and treatment. For details regarding the appropriate dose \ncombination, please see Section 8.1.3.\nSerum urate levels will be unblinded to the investigator and Takeda through the Week 10 Visit of \nthe study to facilitate dose increases based on sUA response. After the Week 10 Visit, sUA \nmeasurements will be blinded to Takeda and the investigator. The interactive voice-activated \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 26 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nresponse system/interactive web-activated response system (IVRS/IWRS) will manage the \ntreatment assignment at randomization and throughout the study medication treatment period.\nSubjects currently on ULT will discontinue treatment at the Day -7 Screening Visit, and will begin \ncolchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis. Subjects not on ULT will begin colchicine \n0.6 mg QD on the Day 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will receive gout flare prophylaxis for \nthe first six months of the study medication treatment period. Alternatively, if colchicine is not \ntolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they will be administered naproxen 250 mg twice \ndaily (BID) with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been maintained on an appropriate dose \n(as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump inhibitor (PPI) other than lansoprazole, \nhe/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In instances when subjects should not \nreceive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or \nprednisone may be provided at the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated \nguidelines listed under the Excluded Medications and Treatments section of the protocol. In the \nevent that colchicine, naproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or prednisone are not \ntolerated or are contraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage \nthe subject\u2019s gout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by \nthe subject, 0.6 mg every other day may be used. Following the Day 1 Visit, subjects will return for \nstudy visits during the first 3 months of the study based on the subject\u2019s sUA response. Once a \nsubject sUA <6.0 mg/dL there will be no further visits until Month 3 (Figure 6.b).\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a \nWeek 4 and Month 3 visit. If the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed \nstudy medication at Week 4, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit will occur \nat Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the \nsubject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If \nthe Week 6 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8 and \nthe next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study \nmedication at the Month 3 visit. After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be made. \nAll subjects will have a Month 3 and Month 6 visits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the \nstudy. In addition, subjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr \u226530 but <60 mL/min) and/or \nsubjects who are elderly (\u226565 years of age) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor \nthe liver function tests (LFTs). Subjects who are withdrawn from study medication treatment but \nhave not withdrawn consent will be contacted every 2 months for the duration of the study or until \nthe subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE.\nA Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) unblinded to the treatment assignment will periodically \nreview results obtained in the enrolled into the study. An independent CV Endpoints Committee \nwill be established to prospectively review all suspected CV events using blinded data.

In addition to dispensing the gout flare prophylaxis, the \ninvestigator may provide the subject with a prescription for an anti-inflammatory/analgesic agent \nof the investigator\u2019s choosing to be used in the event the subject experiences a gout flare during the \nstudy. The Investigator may use a reduced colchicine regimen (for example, colchicine 0.6 mg on \nalternate days) if required because of concomitant medications (medications with potential \ndrug-drug interactions with colchicine, including verapamil, diltiazem, etc. (see Section 7.3.2), \nco-morbid conditions including chronic kidney disease, or patient preference based on prior \nexperience with colchicine. Subjects should be provided additional treatments as appropriate for \ngout flares by their study physician. In addition to dispensing the gout flare prophylaxis, the \ninvestigator may provide the subject with a prescription for an anti-inflammatory/analgesic agent \nof the investigator\u2019s choosing to be used in the event the subject experiences a gout flare during the \nstudy. \nAfter the first six months of gout flare prophylaxis, the United States (US) subjects only will be \nable to receive medication to treat gout flares during the study (eg, colchicine, naproxen and \nlansoprazole, Medrol dose pack, prednisone, indomethacin) using a prescription card to ensure \nthey have adequate medications available to treat gout flares. The study physician should \ndetermine which medication is appropriate for each subject for treatment of gout flares.\nThese medications should be documented in the subject\u2019s source documents and on the \nappropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).\n7.3.2\nExcluded Medications and Treatments\nSubjects may not take any medication (other than study medication) for the purpose of lowering \nsUA levels from at least 7 days prior to the Day 1 Randomization Visit to the End of \nStudy/Discontinuation of Treatment/Early Termination Visit.

Follow-up contacts will occur \nevery 2 months (\u00b110 days).\nThe primary reason for permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment should be noted using \nthe following categories:\n1. AE. The subject has experienced an AE that requires early termination because continued \nparticipation imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject\u2019s health or the subject is unwilling to \ncontinue because of the AE.\nNOTE: Subjects who experience ALT or AST >3xULN in conjunction with elevated total \nbilirubin >2\u00d7ULN and satisfy the following 2 criteria: (1) The liver injury is hepatocellular in \nnature and there is not a prominent cholestatic component, or (2) there is no more likely \nalternative cause than drug induced liver injury, such as acute viral hepatitis A or B, or other \nacute liver disease, should be permanently discontinued from the study drug treatment.\n2. Major protocol deviation. The discovery post randomization that the subject failed to meet \nprotocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol requirements, and continued participation \nposes an unnecessary risk to the subject\u2019s health.\n3. Voluntary withdrawal. The subject (or subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative) wishes to \nwithdraw from taking study drug treatment. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be \nrecorded in the eCRF.\nNOTE: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal \nand, where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded.\n4. Pregnancy. The subject is found to be pregnant.\n5. Lost to follow-up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject \nwere unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented. \n6. Study termination. The sponsor, IRB, ethics committee (EC), or regulatory agency terminates \nthe study.\n7. Other. The specific reasons should be recorded in the \u201cspecify\u201d field of the eCRF.\nThe primary reason that the subject prematurely discontinued study drug should be listed on the \nEnd of Study Drug page of the eCRF. End of Study Drug eCRF should be completed when the \nsubject discontinues study medication or completes the full cycle of study medication; end of \nStudy Drug eCRF completion is independent of the decision to continue participation in the study \nvia follow-up contacts.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 37 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nThese subjects should undergo all procedures required as part of the Discontinuation of Treatment \nVisit when the subject stops study drug treatment. In the event that these subjects later withdraw \nconsent from participation in the study, an additional final Early Termination visit does not need to \nbe performed.\nAt each follow-up contact, sites will ask the subject if they have taken any new medications (over \nthe counter or prescription) since the last contact, or have stopped taking any ongoing medications \nrecorded at the last contact. If yes, the generic medication name, start date, and end date and reason \nfor use will be recorded on the Medication Information Obtained During Follow-up Contact \neCRF.\nSites will also ask the subject at each follow-up contact if they have had any serious adverse events \n(SAEs) or any potential cardiovascular adverse events since the last contact. If yes, these will be \nrecorded on the AE eCRF, and sites should follow the instructions in the Protocol Section 10.2.2, \nCollection and Reporting of SAEs if applicable. All SAEs should be followed up until resolution \nor permanent outcome of the event.\nIf the subject has had a potential serious CV event, he/she should bring the event related \ndocuments (labs, hospital discharge summary, etc) to the clinic. The study team will notify the site \nin writing upon a positive MACE adjudication when it is no longer necessary to follow a subject.\nEfforts will be made to prevent any subject being lost to follow-up during the conduct of the study. \nInvestigators should refer to Section 9.0 for gout flare assessment and Section 9.1.15 for gout flare \ntreatment. Before a subject is considered lost to follow-up, a minimum of two documented \ntelephone contact attempts must have been made and one certified letter must have been sent \nwithin 4 weeks of the most recently missed telephone call to the subject and/or emergency contact \nin an effort to contact the subject.\n7.5\nProcedures for Early Termination of a Subject from the Study (Both Drug and \nVisits)\nA subject may discontinue his or her participation from the study without giving a reason at any \ntime during the study. In addition, efforts should be made to perform all procedures required as \npart of the Early Termination Visit, even if the subject withdrew consent.\nThe primary reason for discontinuation of study participation should be noted using the following \ncategories:\n1. Adverse Event. A subject taking study medication has experienced a pretreatment event or AE \nthat requires early termination because continued participation imposes an unacceptable risk to \nthe subject\u2019s health or the subject is unwilling to continue because of the event. Also applies to \nsubjects no longer taking study medication who are in follow-up who experience a serious CV \nevent that is positively adjudicated as a MACE. NOTE: this reason is not intended to be \nselected for subjects in follow-up experiencing non-MACE AEs as these subjects can, and \nshould, continue participation.\n2. Lost to follow-up. The subject did not return to the clinic and/or attempts to contact the subject \nwere unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented. Before a subject is \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 38 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nconsidered lost to follow-up, a minimum of two documented telephone contact attempts and \none certified letter within 4 weeks of the most recently missed study visit must be sent in an \neffort to contact the subject.\n3. Voluntary withdrawal. The subject (or subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative) wishes to \nwithdraw from the study. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the \neCRF.\n4. Major protocol deviation. The discovery post randomization that the subject failed to meet \nprotocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol requirements, and continued participation \nposes an unnecessary risk to the subject\u2019s health.\n5. Study termination. The sponsor, IRB, EC, or regulatory agency terminates the study.\n6. Other. The specific reasons should be recorded in the \u201cspecify\u201d field of the eCRF.\nThe primary reason that the subject prematurely discontinued planned study visits, including the \nplanned follow-up contacts, should be listed on the End of Study Visits page of the eCRF. End of \nStudy Visits eCRF should be completed when the subject discontinues from the study visits, \nincluding the follow-up contacts, independent of the decision to discontinue study medication.\nInvestigators should refer to Section 9.0 for gout flare assessment and Section 9.1.15 for gout flare \ntreatment.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 39 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n8.0\nSTUDY MEDICATION AND TREATMENTS\n8.1\nStudy Medication and Treatments\nOral administration of:\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 40 mg tablet of febuxostat (35 count [ct.] bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 80 mg tablet of febuxostat (35 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing two 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (35 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing three 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (35 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOne matching placebo capsule (35 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 40 mg tablet of febuxostat (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 80 mg tablet of febuxostat (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing two 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing three 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOne matching placebo capsule (100 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 40 mg tablet of febuxostat (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing 80 mg tablet of febuxostat (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing two 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOver-encapsulated capsule containing three 100 mg tablets of allopurinol (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nOne matching placebo capsule (200 ct. bottle).\n\uf0b7\nProphylaxis treatment: colchicine 0.6 mg tablet (100 ct. bottle) OR naproxen 250 mg tablet \n(100 ct. bottle) and lansoprazole 15 mg capsule (30 ct. bottle) will be provided for the first \n6 months.\n8.1.1\nDosage Form, Manufacturing, Packaging, and Labeling\nDouble-Blind Study Medication (febuxostat 40 mg, 80 mg and Allopurinol 200 mg, 300 mg)\nDouble-blind study medication will consist of over-encapsulated febuxostat 40 mg, febuxostat \n80 mg, allopurinol 200 mg, allopurinol 300 mg and matching placebo capsules which are identical \nin appearance.\nThe capsules will be packaged into 3 different sizes of high density polyethylene bottles with child \nresistant caps containing 35 capsules, 100 capsules and 200 capsules each.

In these patients, life-threatening and fatal colchicine toxicity has been reported with \ncolchicine taken in therapeutic doses. In addition, the following warnings and precautions are \nnoted for colchicine use:\n\uf0b7\nFatal overdoses have been reported with colchicine in adults and children. Keep colchicine out \nof the reach of children.\n\uf0b7\nMyelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia \nhave been reported with colchicine at therapeutic doses.\n\uf0b7\nColchicine-induced neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with \nchronic treatment at therapeutic doses. Patients with renal dysfunction and elderly patients, \neven those with normal renal and hepatic function, are at increased risk. Concomitant use of \natorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, \nbenzafibrate or cyclosporine with colchicine may potentiate the development of myopathy. \nOnce colchicine is stopped, the symptoms generally resolve within one week to several months \n[12].\n\uf0b7\nCo-administration of colchicine with P-gp and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors have been demonstrated \nto alter the concentration of colchicine resulting in life-threatening interaction and death.

An alternative antibiotic treatment option is recommended, when possible. However, \nif no alternative is available, a subject who is on colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis or treatment, \nand who requires treatment with a macrolide or ketolide must be temporarily discontinued from \ncolchicine and switched to naproxen, when possible, for the duration of the macrolide or ketolide \ntreatment and remain off of colchicine for 3 days following the last dose of the macrolide or \nketolide. Subjects may resume colchicine on the fourth day following the last dose of the \nmacrolide or ketolide. Subjects, who are temporarily switched from colchicine to naproxen for \ngout flare prophylaxis during the course of the macrolide or ketolide prescription, and for the \n3 days following the last dose, should be provided with a prescription for naproxen for the duration \nthey need to take it. However, if subjects are permanently switched from colchicine to naproxen as \na result of requiring a concurrent macrolide or ketolide, the sites may contact the IVRS/IWRS to \nhave naproxen supplies administered. If naproxen is not tolerated by a subject, the Takeda Medical \nMonitor should be contacted to discuss alternative prophylaxis options. Although it is preferred \nthat a subject who requires a macrolide or ketolide be switched to naproxen (or an alternative \nprophylaxis), gout flare prophylaxis may be interrupted entirely, but is not recommended as the \nrisk of a gout flare may increase. Subjects who are on naproxen for gout flare prophylaxis may take \na concomitant macrolide or ketolide without stopping naproxen.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 44 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nNaproxen\nNaproxen \n.)

Subjects will be assigned, in the order in which they are \nenrolled into the study, to receive their treatment according to the schedule allocated.\nThe investigator or the investigator\u2019s designee will contact the IVRS/IWRS to register the subject \ninto the study at Screening. During this contact, the investigator or designee will provide the \nnecessary subject-identifying information. At subsequent drug-dispensing visits, the investigator \nor designee will again contact the IVRS/IWRS to request additional investigational drug for a \nsubject. The medication number of the investigational drug to be dispensed will be provided by the \nIVRS/IWRS.\n8.5\nUnblinding Procedure\nThe investigational drug blind shall not be broken by the investigator unless information \nconcerning the study medication is necessary for the medical treatment of the subject. The sponsor \nmust be notified before the investigational drug blind is broken unless a medical emergency \nrequiring unblinding occurs. In this case the investigator (or designee) at the site should contact the \nsponsor (see contact information listed in Section 1.1) within 24 hours.\nFor unblinding a subject, the investigational drug blind can be obtained by accessing the IVRS. \nPlease refer to IVRS Unblinding Worksheet packet. \nThe date, time, and reason the blind was broken must be recorded in the source document and on \nthe appropriate eCRF.\nIf the investigator is unblinded, investigational drug must be stopped immediately. Subjects will \nhave the End of Study/Discontinuation of Treatment/Early Termination visit but will continue to \nbe followed until the end of the study via follow-up contacts.\n8.6\nAccountability and Destruction of Sponsor-Supplied Drugs\nDrug supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being returned.\nUpon receipt of delivery of study medication and prophylaxis medications, the investigator (or \ninvestigator\u2019s designee) must access the IVRS/IWRS to confirm receipt of study medication and \nprophylaxis medications and verify the contents and condition of the shipment against the packing \nlist. Any discrepancies between the packing list and the actual contents must be communicated to \nthe assigned study monitor or a Takeda designee to resolve the issue. The packing list should then \nbe filed in the investigator\u2019s essential document file. Once this process is completed, the study \nmedication and prophylaxis medications should be stored in an appropriate, secure location as \ndescribed in Section 8.0. Resupplies will be handled via IVRS/IWRS. The number of \ncapsules/tablets dispensed and returned will be documented in the subject\u2019s source documents, \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 47 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\neCRF, and recorded on drug accountability logs retained with the investigator\u2019s essential \ndocument file.\nThe investigator must maintain 100% accountability for all sponsor-supplied drugs received and \ndispensed during his or her entire participation in the study. Proper drug accountability includes, \nbut is not limited to:\n\uf0b7\nFrequently verifying that actual inventory matches documented inventory.\n\uf0b7\nVerifying that all bottles used are documented accurately on the log.\n\uf0b7\nVerifying that required fields are completed accurately and legibly.\nIf any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately.\nThe investigator must maintain a current inventory (Drug Accountability Log) of all \nsponsor-supplied study medication delivered to the site, inventory at the site, and subject\u2019s use \nrecords. This log must accurately reflect the drug accountability of the study medication at all \ntimes. The following information will be recorded at a minimum: protocol number and title, name \nof investigator, site identifier and number, description of sponsor-supplied medication and amount \ndispensed, and the date and amount returned to the site by the subject, including the initials of the \nperson dispensing and receiving the study medication. The log should include all required \ninformation as a separate entry for each subject to whom study medication is dispensed.\nPrior to site closure or at appropriate intervals, a representative from the sponsor or its designee \nwill perform clinical study material accountability and reconciliation before clinical study \nmaterials are returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction. The investigator will retain the \ncopy of the original documentation regarding clinical study material accountability, return, and/or \ndestruction, and the original will be sent to the sponsor.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 48 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n9.0\nSTUDY PLAN\n9.1\nStudy Procedures\nThe following sections describe the procedures to be completed at Screening and during the study. \nSubjects are to be assessed by the same investigator or site personnel whenever possible. The \nSchedule of Study Procedures is found in Appendix A.\n9.1.1\nInformed Consent Procedure\nThe requirements of the informed consent are described in Section 15.2.\nInformed consent must be obtained prior to the subject entering into the study, and before any \nprotocol-directed procedures are performed.\nA unique subject identification number (subject number) will be assigned via IVRS/IWRS to each \nsubject at the time that informed consent is obtained and this subject number will be used \nthroughout the study.\n9.1.2\nDemographics, Medical History, and Medication History Procedure\nDemographic information to be obtained will include date of birth, sex, Hispanic ethnicity, race as \ndescribed by the subject, height, weight, alcohol use, and smoking status of the subject at \nScreening.\nA complete medical, CV, and social history, will be obtained at Screening (at the time of informed \nconsent). The general medical history will include a review of all major organ systems. The social \nhistory will include tobacco and alcohol use. The CV history will include CV medications and \ndetailed history of prior CV procedures and/or events that stopped. Ongoing conditions are \nconsidered concurrent medical conditions (see Section 9.1.7).\nSubjects will also be asked about their gout disease history, including frequency of acute gout \nattacks and the related symptoms experienced.\nMedication history information to be obtained includes any medication stopped at or within \n30 days prior to the Screening Visit, and will be documented in the subject\u2019s source documents and \non the appropriate eCRF. Prior NSAID and aspirin use will be collected for the year prior to \ninformed consent.\n9.1.3\nPhysical Examination Procedure\nA complete physical examination (defined as the pretreatment assessment immediately prior to the \nstart of study medication) will consist of the following body systems: (1) eyes; (2) ears, nose, \nthroat; (3) CV system; (4) respiratory system; (5) gastrointestinal system; (6) dermatologic \nsystem; (7) extremities; (8) musculoskeletal system; (9) nervous system; (10) lymph nodes; and \n(11) genitourinary system (optional) and (12) other. All subsequent physical examinations should \nassess clinically significant changes from the baseline examination. A complete physical \nexamination will be performed at Day 1, Month 12, and annually until End of Study/DoT/Early \nTermination.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 49 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n9.1.4\nWeight and Height Procedure\nThe subject\u2019s body weight will be collected (in kilograms) at Screening and End of \nStudy/DoT/Early Termination. The subject\u2019s height will be collected at Screening. A subject \nshould have weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and with shoes off.\n9.1.5\nVital Sign Procedure\nVital signs will be obtained at every scheduled clinic visit (Appendix A). Vital sign \nmeasurements include: body temperature (oral), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood \npressure), and pulse/beats per minute (bpm). Measurements will be made prior to dosing where \napplicable. One measurement of blood pressure and pulse will be measured while subjects are in a \nsitting position after they have been seated for at least 5 minutes and in accordance with American \nHeart Association guidelines (arm supported heart level, proper cuff size, etc).\n9.1.6\nDocumentation of Concomitant Medications\nAt each study visit, subjects will be asked whether they have taken any medication other than the \nstudy medication (used from Screening through End of Study/DoT/Early Termination), and all \nmedication, including vitamin supplements, over-the-counter medications, and oral herbal \npreparations must be recorded in the eCRF, along with Reason for Use. Changes in medication for \nsubjects that have discontinued treatment but remain in follow-up should be recorded on the \nMedication Information Obtained During Follow-up Contact eCRF, and not on the Concomitant \nMedications eCRF.\n9.1.7\nDocumentation of Concurrent Medical Conditions\nConcurrent medical conditions are those significant ongoing conditions or diseases that are present \nat Screening (at time of informed consent). This includes clinically significant laboratory, ECG, or \nphysical examination abnormalities. The condition (ie, diagnosis) should be described, and the \ndate that the condition began should be documented.\n9.1.8\nProcedures for Clinical Laboratory Samples\nLaboratory samples will be taken at the time points stipulated in the Schedule of Study Procedures \n(Appendix A). All samples will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures. \nDetails of these procedures and required safety monitoring will be given in the laboratory manual.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 50 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nTable 9.a\nClinical Laboratory Tests\nHematology\nSerum Chemistry\nUrinalysis\nRed blood cell count\nWhite blood cell count with auto \ndifferential\nHemoglobin\nHematocrit\nPlatelet count\nMean corpuscular volume\nMean corpuscular\nhemoglobin\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin \nconcentration\nALT\nAlbumin\nAlkaline phosphatase\nAST \nTotal bilirubin\nTotal protein\nCreatinine (b)\nBlood urea nitrogen\nCreatine kinase\n\uf067-Glutamyl transferase\nPotassium\nSodium\nCalcium\nMagnesium\nGlucose\nSerum urate (a)\nTriglycerides\nCholesterol\nQualitative\nAppearance\nColor\npH\nSpecific gravity\nKetones\nProtein\nGlucose\nNitrite\nUrobilinogen\nBlood\nOTHER:\nCoagulation: prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time (only for subjects on warfarin) \nInternational normalized ratio (only for subjects on warfarin)\nLipid panel (fasting) (c)\n(a) sUA results will be unblinded to the Sponsor and study site through the Week 10 Visit. \n(b) Estimated Creatinine clearance will be calculated by Central Lab.\n(c) Lipid panel only at Day 1.\nSerum urate values will be blinded to the Sponsor and study site after the Week 10 Visit.

Any medication treatment and any sponsor-supplied drug should be \nimmediately discontinued.\nIf the pregnancy occurs during administration of active study medication, (eg, after Screening or \nwithin 30 days of the last dose of study medication) the pregnancy should be reported \nimmediately, using a pregnancy notification form, to the contact listed in Section 1.1.\nShould the pregnancy occur during or after administration of blinded drug, the investigator must \ninform the subject of her right to receive treatment information. If the subject chooses to receive \nunblinded treatment information, the individual blind should be broken by the investigator.\nIf the subject agrees to the primary care physician being informed, the investigator should notify \nthe subject\u2019s primary care physician that she was participating in a clinical study at the time she \nbecame pregnant and provide details of treatment the subject received (blinded or unblinded, as \napplicable).\nAll reported pregnancies will be followed up to final outcome, using the pregnancy form. The \noutcome, including any premature termination, must be reported to the sponsor.\n9.1.10 ECG Procedure\nA standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed and recorded at the Day 1 and End \nof Study/ DoT/Early Termination, using the site\u2019s ECG equipment. The investigator will interpret \nthe ECG using one of the following categories: within normal limits, abnormal but not clinically \nsignificant, or abnormal and clinically significant. Paper copies of the ECG tracings will be \nincluded in each subject\u2019s source document and details of the findings will be captured in the \nsource and eCRF. For subjects who experience a CV AE that potentially meets the predefined \nMACE criteria, all available ECG tracings must be forwarded to the sponsor, along with all ECGs \nassociated with the AE.\n9.1.11 Documentation of Screen Failure\nInvestigators must account for all subjects who sign the informed consent form.\nIf the subject is found to be ineligible at the Screening Visit, and they have not taken a dose of \nprophylaxis medication, the site personnel should complete the screen failure eCRF. The \nIVRS/IWRS should be contacted as a notification of screen failure, and the primary reason for \nscreen failure should be recorded in the eCRF.\nThe primary reason for screen failure is recorded using the following categories:\n\uf0b7\nPretreatment event/AE.\n\uf0b7\nDid not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria (specific inclusion/exclusion \ncriteria should be recorded in the eCRF).\n\uf0b7\nMajor protocol deviation.\n\uf0b7\nLost to follow-up.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 52 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\uf0b7\nVoluntary withdrawal of the consent (The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be \nrecorded in the eCRF).\n\uf0b7\nStudy termination.\n\uf0b7\nPregnancy.\n\uf0b7\nOther (The specific reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF).\nSubject numbers assigned to subjects who fail screening should not be reused.\n9.1.12 Documentation of Washout Failure\nIf the subject signs the informed consent, and takes at least one dose of prophylaxis medication, \nbut does not randomize to double-blind study medication, they are considered a washout failure. \nThe primary reason for washout failure is recorded using the following categories:\n\uf0b7\nPretreatment event/AE.\n\uf0b7\nDid not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria (The specific inclusion criteria \nnot met or the specific exclusion criteria met should be recorded in the eCRF.)\n\uf0b7\nMajor protocol deviation.\n\uf0b7\nLost to follow-up.\n\uf0b7\nVoluntary withdrawal of the consent (The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be \nrecorded in the eCRF.)\n\uf0b7\nStudy termination.\n\uf0b7\nPregnancy.\n\uf0b7\nOther (The specific reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the eCRF.)\n9.1.13 Documentation of Study Entrance/Randomization\nOnly subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible \nfor randomization into the treatment phase.\nIf the subject is found to be ineligible for randomization the investigator should record the primary \nreason for failure on the applicable eCRF.\n9.1.14 Gout Flare Prophylaxis\nAll subjects will remain on gout flare prophylaxis for the first 6 months of the study.\nSubjects currently on ULT will discontinue these treatments at the Day -7 Screening Visit, and \nwill begin taking colchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis.\nSubjects not currently taking ULT will begin taking colchicine 0.6 mg QD at the \nDay 1/Randomization Visit.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 53 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nAlternatively, if colchicine is not tolerated by the subject and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min \nthey will be administered naproxen 250 mg BID with lansoprazole 15 mg QD.\nIn instances when subjects should not receive colchicine or naproxen, other NSAIDs or prednisone \nmay be provided at the investigator\u2019s discretion in accordance with the stated guidelines listed \nunder Excluded Medications and Treatments (Section 7.3.2). In the event that colchicine, \nnaproxen or other NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors or prednisone are not tolerated or are \ncontraindicated, the Investigator may choose not to use prophylaxis but to manage the subject\u2019s \ngout flares as they occur. Alternatively, if colchicine 0.6 mg daily is not tolerated by the subject, \n0.6 mg every other day may be used.\nProphylaxis medication is only provided until the Month 6 visit, but upon the Investigator\u2019s \nrequest, continued prescription may be allowed. Please note that study prescription cards intended \nto pay for acute gout flare medication cannot be used to pay for ongoing prophylaxis medication.\n9.1.15 Treatment of Gout Flares\nSubjects who experience a gout flare and who are taking colchicine for prophylaxis and have taken \ntheir daily dose, may take an additional colchicine 0.6 mg tablet at the onset of the flare, with \nanother tablet one hour later, for a maximum of 3 tablets (1.8 mg) in a 24 hour period. After \n12 hours, the original prophylaxis dose may be resumed [12].\nSubjects experiencing a gout flare and who are taking naproxen for prophylaxis, may take \nnaproxen 500 mg BID (2 additional doses of naproxen 250 mg) on the day the gout flare starts \nfollowed by 1 additional 250 mg dose on each subsequent day until the flare subsides. Gout flares \nmay also be treated at the discretion of the investigator, as long as this treatment is in compliance \nwith the prohibited medications for this study.\nAt the Day -7 Screening Visit in addition to dispensing the gout flare prophylaxis, the investigator \nshould provide the subject with a prescription for an anti-inflammatory/analgesic agent of the \ninvestigator\u2019s choosing, to be used in the event the subject experiences a gout flare during the \nstudy and an increase of the prophylaxis medication dose is not efficacious in treating the flare. \nThis may be done at the discretion of the investigator and in accordance with their practice \nguidelines.\nSubjects are to be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as they begin to have a gout flare. \nAn unscheduled visit can be conducted if deemed appropriate by the investigator. All subjects that \nexperience flares while on the study will have the option to receive acute gout flare treatment if \ndeemed appropriate by the principal investigator. The investigator may also consult with the \nTakeda Medical Monitor for further discussion. A Gout Flare Assessment Worksheet (sample \nshown in Appendix G) will be used to collect the gout flare information.\n9.1.16 Gout Flare Assessment\nSubjects will be assessed for gout flares beginning at the Day -7 Screening Visit and throughout \nthe duration of the study. Subjects are to be instructed to call the investigator as soon as they think \nthey may be having a gout flare. The Gout Flare Assessment Worksheet, developed with \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 54 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDrs. Schumacher, Gaffo, Saag and Singh [13] (sample shown in Appendix G) will be completed \nby the site personnel (ie, study coordinator, study nurse, or the investigator).\nAll gout flares should be followed until complete resolution. Subjects should be instructed to \ncontact the site when the flare has resolved (typically 7-10 days after onset). The study site will \ncontact the subject 7 days after the initial report if the subject fails to report the end date of the gout \nflare. The attempts to contact the subject to obtain the end date of the gout flare must be \ndocumented (2 documented telephone contact attempts).\nSubjects will be instructed to report the following information: the onset and end date of the flare, \nthe kind of prophylaxis medication they are taking at the time of the event, whether or not the \nattack required medication (including type) and dates of treatment, the location of the flare, signs \nand symptoms regarding the flare including: swelling, redness, tenderness and joint warmth the \nworst pain of the gout flare (pain at rest), the assessment of current gout flare compared with all \nprevious gout flares in any joints. The investigator will review the information provided and assess \nwhether or not they believe the subject experienced a gout flare and/or document an alternative \netiology.\nThe Gout Flare Assessment Worksheet will be maintained with the subject\u2019s source documents. \nAll confirmed gout flares will be transcribed from the worksheet onto the Gout Flare eCRF page. \nThese entries should not to be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF (unless they meet SAE \ncriteria). If the investigator feels it is appropriate, an unscheduled visit may be scheduled.\n9.1.17 Physical Assessment of Tophi\nSubjects will be assessed for the presence of tophi by palpation at the Day 1 visit. The most easily \nidentified and palpable tophus will be designated as \u201cprimary\u201d and the presence or absence of this \ntophus should be assessed annually and at the End of Study/DoT/Early Termination visit. In \naddition, all tophi will be counted and the number recorded on the Tophi eCRF page at all tophi \nassessment visits.\n9.1.18 Rash Assessment\nAEs of rash will be collected beginning at the Day -7 Visit until 30 days after study medication is \ndiscontinued. AEs of rash will be documented on the Rash Adverse Event Worksheet (sample \nshown in Appendix F) that will be maintained with the subject\u2019s source documents. Rash AEs \nrecorded on the Rash Adverse Event Worksheet will be transcribed over to the Adverse Event \neCRF. So long as the event is not deemed a SAE, the completed Rash Adverse Event Worksheet \nwill be faxed to Takeda, in accordance with the instructions on the worksheet, within 48 hours of \nthe site\u2019s knowledge of the event. If the event is deemed a serious adverse event, follow procedure \nin 10.2.2.\n9.1.19 Management, Withdrawal and Follow-Up of Subjects With Liver Enzyme Elevations\nIf the ALT or AST value rises to >3\u00d7ULN, laboratory tests (at minimum, serum alkaline \nphosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and INR) should be repeated within 48 to 72 hours. If the \nALT or AST value remains elevated >3\u00d7ULN when repeated, and this observation cannot be \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 55 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nexplained by concomitant disease or another alternative etiology, the abnormality must be \nrecorded as an AE, if it has not already. In these cases, additional tests are required to rule out other \netiologies. The investigator must contact the Takeda Medical Monitor for determination of \nadditional testing, consideration of immediate discontinuation of study medication, discussion of \nthe relevant subject details, and possible alternative etiologies.\nIn addition, study medication should be temporarily discontinued with appropriate clinical \nfollow-up, including repeat laboratory tests, until a subject\u2019s laboratory profile has returned to \nnormal, if the following circumstances occur at any time during study medication treatment phase:\n\uf0b7\nALT or AST >8\u00d7ULN, or\n\uf0b7\nALT or AST >5\u00d7ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks, or\n\uf0b7\nALT or AST >3\u00d7ULN in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin >2\u00d7ULN or INR >1.5, or\n\uf0b7\nALT or AST >3\u00d7ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain \nor tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%).\nSubjects who experience ALT or AST >3\u00d7ULN in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin \n>2\u00d7ULN and who also satisfy one of the following criteria should be permanently discontinued \nfrom the study medication treatment phase:\n\uf0b7\nThe liver injury is hepatocellular in nature and there is not a prominent cholestatic component; \nor\n\uf0b7\nThere is no more likely alternative cause than drug induced liver injury, such as acute viral \nhepatitis A or B, or other acute liver disease.\nAdditional information will be collected in the eCRF for liver enzyme AEs that cannot be \nexplained by concomitant disease. This information will include recent history (if any), of alcohol \nuse, blood transfusions, occupational/toxic exposure, tattooing, recreational drug use, special diet, \nsurgery/general anesthesia, travel, or use of herbal supplements or teas. This information will also \ninclude signs and symptoms (if any) associated with the AE and results of any additional \ndiagnostic tests performed.\n9.2\nMonitoring Subject Compliance\nSubjects will be required to bring study medication containers to each clinic visit, regardless of\nwhether the study medication container is empty.\nIf a subject is persistently noncompliant with the sponsor-supplied double blind study drugs\n(<80% or >120% of the allocated medication for the period since the last visit) it may be \nappropriate to withdraw the subject from the study medication treatment and continue in the study \nto monitor for potential CV events. All subjects should be reinstructed about the dosing \nrequirement during study visits. The authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must \ndocument the process in the subject source records.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 56 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n9.3\nSchedule of Observations and Procedures\nThe schedule for all study-related procedures for all evaluations is shown in Appendix A. \nAssessments should be completed at the designated visit/time point(s). Study days/weeks and visit \nwindows should be calculated after randomization and should be calculated from the day of the \nfirst dose of double-blind treatment (Day 1).\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of the predefined MACE; the study \nwill end when the required number of events has accrued. The duration of the study is expected to \nbe 9 years. The length of study participation for each subject will vary (due to the event driven \nstudy design).\nSubjects are required to bring all of the Sponsor supplied medication to every visit.\n9.3.1\nScreening\nSubjects will be evaluated for enrollment based on all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects will be \nevaluated for enrollment based on their prior history of a major CV or cerebrovascular event. \nSubjects currently receiving ULT will begin the 7 day washout and should receive prophylaxis \nmedication.\nIf a subject has a gout flare at the Screening Visit, the visit procedures should be delayed and the \nsubject should be treated for the gout flare and return to the study site no earlier than 2, but no later \nthan 3, weeks after the resolution of the flare. Please contact the Medical Monitor if randomization \ndoes not occur within four weeks of the Screening visit. Screening may be less than 7 days for \nsubjects not washing off of ULTs.

(Intermittent \nevents for pre-existing conditions or underlying disease should be not considered PTEs or \nAEs).\n\uf0b7\nNecessitate therapeutic intervention.\n\uf0b7\nRequire an invasive diagnostic procedure.\n\uf0b7\nRequire discontinuation or a change in dose of study medication or a concomitant medication.\n\uf0b7\nBe considered unfavorable by the investigator for any reason.\nDiagnoses versus signs and symptoms:\n\uf0b7\nEach event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including \nabnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as \nadditional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded \nappropriately as a pretreatment event(s) or as an AE(s).\nLaboratory values and ECG findings:\n\uf0b7\nChanges in laboratory values or ECG parameters are only considered to be pretreatment events \nor AEs if they are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervention is \nrequired or if the investigator judges the change to be beyond the range of normal physiologic \nfluctuation). A laboratory retest and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value are not \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 65 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nconsidered an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for \nverification, evaluation or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an intervention.\n\uf0b7\nIf abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an \noverall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be \nreported appropriately as a pretreatment event or as an AE.\n\uf0b7\nIf the ALT or AST value rises to >3\u00d7ULN, laboratory tests (at minimum, serum alkaline \nphosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and INR) should be repeated within 48 to 72 hours. If \nthe ALT or AST value remains elevated >3\u00d7ULN when repeated, and this observation cannot \nbe explained by concomitant disease or another alternative etiology, the abnormality must be \nrecorded as an AE, if it has not already.\n\uf0b7\nPre-existing conditions: Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing of informed \nconsent) are considered concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as \npretreatment events or AEs. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication \nof such a concurrent condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded \nappropriately as a pretreatment event (worsening or complication occurs before start of study \nmedication) or an AE (worsening or complication occurs after start of study medication). \nInvestigators should ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condition \n(eg, \u201dworsening of\u2026\u201d).\n\uf0b7\nIf a subject has a pre-existing episodic condition (eg, asthma, epilepsy) any occurrence of an \nepisode should only be captured as a PTE/AE if the episodes become more frequent, serious or \nsevere in nature, that is, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the \nchange in the condition from Baseline (eg, \u201cworsening of\u2026\u201d)\n\uf0b7\nIf a subject has a degenerative concurrent condition (eg, cataracts), worsening of the condition \nshould only be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater extent to that which would be \nexpected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in \nthe condition (eg, \u201cworsening of\u2026\u201d).\nWorsening of pretreatment or AEs:\n\uf0b7\nIf the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a pretreatment event after starting \nadministration of the study medication, the worsening or complication should be recorded \nappropriately as an AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the \nchange in the condition (eg, \u201cworsening of\u2026\u201d).\n\uf0b7\nIf the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in study \nmedication, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators \nshould ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, \u201cworsening \nof\u2026\u201d).\nChanges in severity of AEs/PTEs/SAEs:\n\uf0b7\nIf the subject experiences changes in severity of an AE/PTE/SAE, the event should be captured \nonce with the maximum severity recorded.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 66 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nPreplanned surgeries or procedures:\n\uf0b7\nPreplanned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to signing of \ninformed consent are not considered pretreatment events or AEs. However, if a preplanned \nprocedure is performed early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing \ncondition, the worsening of the condition should be captured appropriately as a pretreatment \nevent or an AE. Complications resulting from any planned surgery should be reported as \nadverse events.\nElective surgeries or procedures:\n\uf0b7\nElective procedures performed where there is no change in the subject\u2019s medical condition \nshould not be recorded as pretreatment events or AEs, but should be documented in the \nsubject\u2019s source documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be \nreported as adverse events.\nInsufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):\n\uf0b7\nInsufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic action, should NOT be recorded as \nan AE. The principal investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of \npre-existing illness and lack of therapeutic efficacy.\nOverdose:\n\uf0b7\nCases of overdose with any medication without manifested side effects are NOT considered \npretreatment events or AEs, but will instead be documented on an Overdose page of the eCRF. \nAny manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE \npage of the eCRF.\n10.1.4 SAEs\nAn SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:\n1. Results in DEATH.\n2. Is LIFE THREATENING.\n\uf0b7\nThe term \u201clife threatening\u201d refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the \ntime of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death \nif it were more severe.\n3. Requires subject HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of existing hospitalization.\n4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.\n5. Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT.\n6.

Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed \nas \u201cNo\u201d.\n10.2\nProcedures\n10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs\n10.2.1.1 Pretreatment Event and AE Collection Period\nCollection of pretreatment events will commence from the time the subject signs the informed \nconsent to participate in the study and continue until either the administration of sponsor-supplied \ngout flare prophylaxis on Day -7 for subjects requiring ULT washout, or administration of \ndouble-blind medication at Day 1 for subjects not requiring ULT washout. For subjects who \ndiscontinue prior to any prophylaxis or double-blind study drug administration, pretreatment \nevents are collected until the subject discontinues study participation.\nCollection of AEs will commence from the time that subjects are administered sponsor-supplied \nmedication, which is at Day -7 for subjects requiring ULT washout, or administration of \ndouble-blind medication at Day 1 for subjects not requiring ULT washout. Subjects will be \ninstructed at their last study visit to call and report any AEs that occur within 30 days of last dose of\nstudy medication and any potential CV events until the completion of the study. All adverse events \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 69 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nwill be reported in detail on the appropriate eCRF and followed to a satisfactory conclusion (ie. \nuntil the adverse event resolves, and returns to baseline, or becomes stabilized).\n10.2.1.2 Pretreatment Event and AE Reporting\nAt each study visit, the investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. A \nneutral question, such as \u201cHow have you been feeling since your last visit?\u201d may be asked. \nSubjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study.\nAll non-SAEs that occur will be collected from the time the informed consent form is signed.\nSubjects experiencing a serious PTE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any \nclinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or there is a satisfactory \nexplanation for the change. Non-serious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, need \nnot to be followed-up for the purposes of the protocol.\nAll subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study medication \nor not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in \nlaboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the \nchanges observed. All pretreatment events and AEs will be documented in the pretreatment \nevent/AE page of the eCRF, whether or not the investigator concludes that the event is related to \nthe drug treatment. The following information will be documented for each event:\n\uf0b7\nEvent term.\n\uf0b7\nStart and stop date.\n\uf0b7\nSeverity.\n\uf0b7\nInvestigator\u2019s opinion of the causal relationship between the event and administration of study \ndrug(s) (the relationship should be assessed as \u201cYes\u201d if the investigator considers that there is \nreasonable possibility that an event is due to study drug (double-blind or prophylaxis). \nOtherwise, the relationship should be assessed as \u201cNo\u201d) (not completed for pretreatment \nevents).\n\uf0b7\nInvestigator\u2019s opinion of the causal relationship to study procedure(s), including the details of \nthe suspected procedure.\n\uf0b7\nAction concerning study drug (not applicable for pretreatment events).\n\uf0b7\nOutcome of event.\n10.2.2 Collection and Reporting of SAEs\nWhen an SAE occurs after informed consent through the AE collection period it should be \nreported according to the following procedure:\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 70 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nA Takeda SAE form must be completed in English and signed by the investigator immediately or \nwithin 1 working day of first onset or notification of the event.

Copies of any relevant data from the hospital \nnotes (eg, ECGs, laboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the \naddressee, if requested.\nAll SAEs should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event. The timelines \nand procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for the initial report.\n10.2.4 Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or ECs, and Regulatory Authorities\nThe sponsor will be responsible for reporting all applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, \ninvestigators and IRBs or ECs, as applicable, in accordance with national regulations in the \ncountries where the study is conducted. The sponsor will also prepare an expedited report for other \nsafety issues where these might materially alter the current benefit-risk assessment of an \ninvestigational medicinal product or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the \ninvestigational medicinal products administration or in the overall conduct of the trial.\nFor all active investigators, the sponsor will prepare an expedited report for all SAEs that are \nunexpected and potentially related to the study medication, and copies will be distributed to all \nconcerned regulatory authorities, investigator(s), and IRBs or ECs according to all applicable laws \nand regulations.

The final selection of the CV events for adjudication is done by the adjudication \ncommittee chair. Non-serious, potential CV events will not be adjudicated. \nAll investigational sites will be required to collect relevant clinical information required for \nadjudication of all deaths and selected CV SAEs. A CV worksheet will be provided to the \ninvestigational sites as a guide to ensure that supporting clinical information for each of these \nevents are collected and compiled by the site and forwarded to Takeda Pharmacovigilance when \navailable. The worksheet is not intended to be all inclusive and investigators should use medical \njudgment to determine what additional supporting documentation should be collected.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 72 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n11.0\nSTUDY-SPECIFIC COMMITTEES\n11.1\nIndependent DMC\nAn independent DMC will be established to monitor the progress and the overall safety of subjects \nenrolled in this study. This committee will periodically review study safety data and make \nrecommendations to Takeda as appropriate to ensure the safety of subjects. The committee will \ncomprise of external consultants who have expertise in the conduct and review of clinical trials. \nDetails of the DMC membership and responsibilities will be described in the DMC charter.

Drugs will be coded using the World \nHealth Organization Drug Dictionary.\n12.1\neCRFs\nCompleted eCRFs are required for each subject.\nThe sponsor or its designee will supply investigative sites with eCRFs. These forms are used to \ntransmit the information collected in the performance of this study to the sponsor and regulatory \nauthorities. eCRFs must be completed in English. Corrections to eCRFs include an audit trail that \ncaptures the old information, the new information, the name of the person making the correction, \nthe date the correction was made and the reason for change. The principal investigator must review \nthe eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and must sign and date the appropriate eCRF page as \nindicated. Furthermore, the investigator must retain full responsibility for the accuracy and \nauthenticity of all data entered on the eCRFs.\neCRFs are accessed through the Medidata remote data capture application, which allows for \non-site data entry and data management. Site users can read from and write to the Sponsor\u2019s \ndatabase where the clinical data are collected. This provides immediate, direct data transfer to the \ndatabase, as well as immediate detection of discrepancies, enabling site coordinators to resolve and \nmanage discrepancies in a timely manner. Each person involved with the study at each site will \nhave an individual identification code and password that allows for record traceability. Thus, the \nsystem, and subsequently any investigative reviews, can identify coordinators, investigators, and \nindividuals who have entered or modified records.\neCRFs will be reviewed for completeness and acceptability at the study site during periodic visits \nby study monitors for completeness and acceptability. The sponsor or its designee will be \npermitted to review the subject\u2019s medical and hospital records pertinent to the study to ensure \naccuracy of the eCRFs. The completed original eCRFs are the sole property of the sponsor and \nshould not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of \nappropriate governmental health or regulatory authorities, without written permission of the \nsponsor.\n12.2\nRecord Retention\nThe investigator agrees to keep the records stipulated in Section 12.1 and those documents that \ninclude (but are not limited to) the study-specific documents, the identification log of all \nparticipating subjects, medical records, source worksheets, all original signed and dated informed \nconsent forms, subject authorization forms regarding the use of personal health information \n(if separate from the informed consent forms), and detailed records of drug disposition to enable \nevaluations or audits from regulatory authorities, the sponsor or its designees. Each study site will \nhave access to the study data in Medidata until they receive a CD of all subject data in PDF format \nafter database lock. Furthermore, International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 4.9.5 requires \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 74 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nthe investigator to retain essential documents specified in ICH E6 (Section 8) until at least 2 years \nafter the last approval of a marketing application for a specified drug indication being investigated \nor, if an application is not approved, until at least 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and \nregulatory authorities are notified. In addition, ICH 4.9.5 states that the study records should be \nretained until an amount of time specified by applicable regulatory requirements or for a time \nspecified in the Clinical Study Site Agreement between the investigator and sponsor.\nRefer to the Clinical Study Site Agreement for the sponsor\u2019s requirements on record retention. The \ninvestigator should contact and receive written approval from the sponsor before disposing of any \nsuch documents.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 75 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n13.0\nSTATISTICAL METHODS\n13.1\nStatistical and Analytical Plans\nA statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to the first subject enrolled. \nThis document will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and \nanalysis methodology to address all study objectives.\nA periodic blind data review will be conducted prior to unblinding of subject\u2019s treatment \nassignment. This review will assess the accuracy and completeness of the study database, subject \nevaluability, and appropriateness of the planned statistical methods.\n13.1.1 Analysis Sets\nThe primary endpoint and all other analyses by treatment group will be analyzed according to the \nrandomized treatment using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of all subjects who \nwere randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind study medication. If a subject \nreports a composite MACE after treatment discontinuation, then the reported event will be counted \ntoward the treatment to which they were randomized.\n13.1.2 Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics\nDemographic and baseline characteristics (eg, age, race, gender, height, weight, body mass index \n[BMI], sUA) will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each treatment group and overall \n(eg, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum values, and the number and percent of subjects \nin specified categories). For categorical variables (eg, race, gender) the number and percent of \nsubjects in specified categories will be presented. Unless otherwise specified, descriptive statistics \non continuous variables (eg, age, height, weight, BMI, sUA) will consist of the number of subjects \n(N), mean, SD, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum. Gout history and \nCV history will also be summarized.\n13.1.3 Safety Analyses\nSafety will be assessed by evaluating the incidence of adverse events including pre-defined \nMACE, laboratory tests and vital signs. A blinded CV Endpoints Committee will adjudicate each \ndeath and selected serious cardiovascular adverse event to determine if the event meets the MACE \ncriteria.\n13.1.3.1 CV Safety Analysis\nAssuming constant proportional hazards, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint will be \ncomputed based on febuxostat and allopurinol estimated hazard rates. The febuxostat treatment \ngroup will be compared to the allopurinol treatment group to test for non-inferiority in the MACE \ncomposite rate using a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment and baseline renal function \nas factors in the model. Non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol will be declared at an interim \nor at the final analysis if the current upper 1-sided CI for the hazard ratio calculated with critical \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 76 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nvalues obtained using the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending function, which \npreserves an overall 1-sided false-rejection rate of 2.5%, is less than 1.3.\nAnalysis of the secondary and other cardiovascular endpoints will be conducted similarly using a \nCox proportional hazards model. No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.\nAdditional analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using Cox-proportional \nhazards model controlling for the effect of NSAIDs use. The model will include treatment group, \nbaseline renal function, and use of NSAIDs as explanatory variables. A similar analysis will \ncontrol for the effect of low-dose aspirin use.\n13.1.3.2 Other Safety Analysis\nTreatment-emergent AEs will be summarized using the MedDRA coding dictionary. In general \nAEs will be tabulated at each of the following levels: overall summary (subject with at least 1 AE), \nthe MedDRA system organ class (SOC), the MedDRA high level term (HLT), and the MedDRA \npreferred term (PT). Tabulations at each level of a term will present count (n) and percentage of \nsubjects reporting any event for that term. Subjects reporting more than one occurrence for the \nterm (level) being summarized will be counted only once.\n13.1.4 Efficacy Analysis\nThe percentage of subjects whose average sUA level during the period from the end of the first \nyear of treatment to the end of the study will be summarized, using the following categories\n<4.0 mg/dL, \u22654 to <5.0 mg/dL, \u22655 to <6.0 mg/dL, and \u22656.0 mg/dL.\nThe flare rate from the end of the first year of treatment to the end of the study will be summarized \nby the average sUA level during the period from the end of the first year of treatment to the end of \nthe study, using the following categories <4.0 mg/dL, \u22654 to <5.0 mg/dL, \u22655 to <6.0 mg/dL, and \n\u22656.0 mg/dL. Flare rate will be calculated as the number of flares from the end of the first year of \ntreatment to the end of the study divided by the length of time on treatment during the period after \nthe first year and through the end of the study.\nThe percentage of subjects with tophi resolution by the end of Year 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be \nsummarized by the average sUA level during the period from the end of the first year of treatment \nto the end of the study, using the following categories <4.0 mg/dL, \u22654 to <5.0 mg/dL, \u22655 to \n<6.0 mg/dL, and \u22656.0 mg/dL. The estimate for tophi resolution rate will be calculated for each \naverage post-baseline sUA category using the life-table method. In calculating the percentage of \nsubjects with tophi resolution by average post-baseline sUA, yearly intervals will be used in the \nlife-table analysis.\n13.2\nInterim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination\nThis study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE for assessing non-inferiority of \nfebuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk assuming a true hazard ratio of \n1.0 and 90% power. Interim analyses will be conducted when approximately 25%, 50% and 75% \nof the events or equivalently approximately 156, 312, and 468 events have occurred, followed by a \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 77 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nfinal analysis. In this group sequential trial with 4 equally-spaced analyses and a one-sided overall \nsignificance level of 0.025, the Lan-DeMets alpha spending approach with an O\u2019Brien-Fleming \nstopping boundary will be used. Therefore, at the 3 interim and at the final analyses, one-sided \nconfidence intervals for the hazard ratio of febuxostat relative to allopurinol for the primary \nendpoint will be constructed using critical values obtained using the Lan-DeMets \n-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. At each analysis, if the upper one-sided confidence \nlimit of the hazard ratio is less than 1.3, the study will be stopped and the non-inferiority of \nfebuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk will be declared.\nPeriodically during the course of the study, a blinded assessment of the annual adjudicated MACE \nrate will be made. The number of subjects planned to be enrolled in this study was based on an \nevent rate of 2.8%, which was based on limited information. Based on the overall blinded MACE \nrate observed, an assessment will be made to determine whether or not to adjust the number of \nsubjects planned for enrollment.\n13.3\nDetermination of Sample Size\nA total of 7500 subjects (3750 per treatment group) are planned to be enrolled into this study. This \nsample size provides at least 90% power to meet a noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio \n(febuxostat relative to allopurinol) for the primary endpoint, assuming a true hazard ratio of 1.0, at \na 1-sided 2.5% significance level. This study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE.\nFor the determination of noninferiority between the febuxostat treatment group and the allopurinol \ntreatment group, the sample size calculation used the following assumptions: \n\uf0b7\nConstant proportional hazards and exponential survival curves.\n\uf0b7\nAnnual adjudicated MACE rate of 2.8%.\n\uf0b7\nMaximum length of participation of 5 years.\n\uf0b7\nAccrual time of 2.5 years.\n\uf0b7\nAnnual drop-out rate of 10%.\nThese assumptions were used prior to the initiation of the study to calculate the number of subjects \nto be enrolled in order to obtain the required number of MACE.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 78 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n14.0\nQUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\n14.1\nStudy-Site Monitoring Visits\nMonitoring visits to the study site will be made periodically during the study to ensure that all \naspects of the protocol are followed.

At the expiration of such 60-day period, the investigator may proceed \nwith the presentation or submission for publication unless the sponsor has notified the institution \nor the investigator in writing that such proposed publication or presentation discloses the sponsor\u2019s \nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 82 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nconfidential and proprietary technical information. Further, upon the request of the sponsor, the \ninvestigator will delay the publication or presentation for an additional 90 days to permit the \nsponsor to take necessary actions to protect its intellectual property interests.\n15.4.2 Clinical Trial Registration\nIn order to ensure that information on clinical trials reaches the public in a timely manner and to \ncomply with applicable law, regulation and guidance, Takeda will, at a minimum register all \nclinical trials conducted in patients that it sponsors anywhere in the world on ClinicalTrials.gov or \nother publicly accessible websites before trial initiation. Takeda contact information, along with \ninvestigator\u2019s city, state (for US investigators), country, and recruiting status will be registered and \navailable for public viewing.\nFor some registries, Takeda will assist callers in locating trial sites closest to their homes by \nproviding the investigator name, address, and phone number to the callers requesting trial \ninformation. Once subjects receive investigator contact information, they may call the site \nrequesting enrollment into the trial. The investigative sites are encouraged to handle the trial \ninquiries according to their established subject screening process. If the caller asks additional \nquestions beyond the topic of trial enrollment, they should be referred to the sponsor.\nAny investigator who objects to Takeda providing this information to callers must provide Takeda \nwith a written notice requesting that their information not be listed on the registry site\n15.4.3 Clinical Trial Results Disclosure\nTakeda will post the results of this clinical trial, regardless of outcome, on ClinicalTrials.gov or \nother publicly accessible websites, as required by applicable laws and/or regulations.\n15.5\nInsurance and Compensation for Injury\nEach subject participating in the study must be insured in accordance with the regulations \napplicable to the site where the subject is enrolled. If a local underwriter is required, then the \nsponsor or sponsor\u2019s designee will obtain clinical study insurance against the risk of injury to \nclinical study subjects. Refer to the Clinical Study Site Agreement regarding the sponsor\u2019s policy \non subject compensation and treatment for injury. If the investigator has questions regarding this \npolicy, he or she should contact the sponsor or sponsor\u2019s designee.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 83 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n16.0\nREFERENCES\n1.

AE. The subject has experienced an AE that requires early termination because continued \nparticipation imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject\u2019s health or the subject is unwilling to \ncontinue because of the AE.\nNOTE: Subjects who experience ALT or AST >3xULN in conjunction with elevated total \nbilirubin >2\u00d7ULN and satisfy the following 2 criteria: (1) The liver injury is hepatocellular in \nnature and there is not a prominent cholestatic component, or (2) there is no more likely \nalternative cause than drug induced liver injury, such as acute viral hepatitis A or B, or other \nacute liver disease, should be permanently discontinued from the study drug treatment.\n2. Major protocol deviation. The discovery post randomization that the subject failed to meet \nprotocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol requirements, and continued participation \nposes an unnecessary risk to the subject\u2019s health.\n3. Voluntary withdrawal. The subject (or subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative) wishes to \nwithdraw from taking study drug treatment. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be \nrecorded in the eCRF.\nNOTE: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal \nand, where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded.\n4. Pregnancy. The subject is found to be pregnant\n5. Lost to follow-up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject \nwere unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented. Before a subject is \nconsidered lost to follow-up, a minimum of 2 documented telephone contact attempts and \n1 certified letter within 4 weeks of the most recently missed study visit must be sent in an effort \nto contact the subject.\n6. Study termination. The sponsor, IRB, ethics committee (EC), or regulatory agency terminates \nthe study.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 104 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n7.

End of Study Drug eCRF should be completed when the \nsubject discontinues study medication or completes the full cycle of study medication; end of \nStudy Drug eCRF completion is independent of the decision to continue participation in the study \nvia telephone contacts.\nEfforts will be made to avoid any subject being lost to follow-up during the conduct of the study. \nInvestigators should refer to Section 9.0 for gout flare assessment and Section 9.1.15 for gout flare \ntreatment.\n(Section 7.5)\nSubjects who stop taking study medication will continue in the study as long as consent is not \nwithdrawn by the subject until the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as \na MACE, the required number of study MACE events have occurred, or until the study concludes. \nThe contacts will occur via phone calls every 2 months.\nIn addition, efforts should be made to perform all procedures required as part of the Early \nTermination Visit when the subject discontinues study drug treatment, regardless of whether or \nnot the subject continues participation in the study.\nFurther, at each telephone contact, sites will ask the subject if they have taken any new \nmedications (OTC or Prescription) since the last contact, or have stopped taking any ongoing \nmedications recorded at the last contact. If yes, the generic medication name, start date, and end \ndate and reason for use will be recorded on the eCRF.\nSites will also ask the subject at each telephone contact if they have had any SAEs or any potential \ncardiovascular adverse events since the last telephone contact. If yes, these will be recorded on the \nAE eCRF, and sites should follow the instructions in the Protocol Section 10.2.2, Collection and \nReporting of SAEs if applicable. All SAEs should be followed up until resolution or permanent \noutcome of the event.\nSubjects who have withdrawn from study medication treatment but have not withdrawn consent \nwill be followed until the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE \nor until the study concludes. Subjects will be contacted by telephone every 2 months (\u00b110 days) to \ndetermine if any potential CV events have occurred.\nIf the subject has had a potential CV event, he/she should bring the event related documents (labs, \nhospital discharge summary, etc) to the clinic.\nIf after two telephone attempts a subject cannot be reached, then the subject\u2019s emergency person \nwill be contacted. Before a subject is considered lost to follow-up, a minimum of two documented \ntelephone contact attempts must have been made and 1 certified letter must have been sent within \n4 weeks of the most recently missed telephone call to the subject or emergency contact in an effort \nto contact the subject.\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 105 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nRevised Text\nSubjects who discontinue study drug treatment will continue to participate in the study through \nfollow-up contacts unless: consent is withdrawn by the subject; the subject experiences a CV \nevent that is positively adjudicated as a MACE (the study team will notify the site in writing \nwhen it is no longer necessary to follow the subject with a positive MACE adjudication); the \nrequired number of study MACE events have occurred; or until the study is ended. \nFollow-up contacts will occur every 2 months (\u00b110 days).\nThe primary reason for permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment should be noted using \nthe following categories:\n1.

If yes, these will be \nrecorded on the AE eCRF, and sites should follow the instructions in the Protocol Section 10.2.2, \nCollection and Reporting of SAEs if applicable. All SAEs should be followed up until resolution \nor permanent outcome of the event.\nIf the subject has had a potential serious CV event, he/she should bring the event related \ndocuments (labs, hospital discharge summary, etc) to the clinic. The study team will notify the \nsite in writing upon a positive MACE adjudication when it is no longer necessary to follow a \nsubject.\nEfforts will be made to prevent any subject being lost to follow-up during the conduct of the \nstudy. Investigators should refer to Section 9.0 for gout flare assessment and Section 9.1.15\nfor gout flare treatment. Before a subject is considered lost to follow-up, a minimum of two \ndocumented telephone contact attempts must have been made and one certified letter must \nhave been sent within 4 weeks of the most recently missed telephone call to the subject \nand/or emergency contact in an effort to contact the subject.\nRationale for Amendment\nCombined two sections (7.4 and 7.5) from previous protocol version to clarify and aid in proper \nprotocol for DoT subjects; which includes adding all instances where a DoT subject will no longer \nbe followed. Clarify the expectations for attempted contacts with subjects who are lost to \nfollow-up. Renamed follow-up contact procedure to indicate flexibility in method of contacting \nsubjects.\nPage 38, Section 7.5 Procedures for Early Termination of a Subject from the Study (Both \nDrug and Visits)\nExisting Text\nA subject\u2019s study medication may be temporarily suspended or permanently ceased at any time at \nthe discretion of the Investigator. \nIf consent is withdrawn for continued participation (ie, bimonthly phone calls) after discontinuing \nstudy medication treatment, the primary reason for discontinuation of study participation should \nbe noted using the following categories:\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 107 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\n1. Adverse Event. The subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE.\nRevised Text\nA subject may discontinue his or her participation from the study without giving a reason at \nany time during the study. In addition, efforts should be made to perform all procedures \nrequired as part of the Early Termination Visit, even if the subject withdrew consent.\nThe primary reason for discontinuation of study participation should be noted using the following \ncategories:\n1. Adverse Event. A subject taking study medication has experienced a pretreatment event \nor AE that requires early termination because continued participation imposes an \nunacceptable risk to the subject\u2019s health or the subject is unwilling to continue because \nof the event. Also applies to subjects no longer taking study medication who are in \nfollow-up who experience a serious CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE. \nNOTE: this reason is not intended to be selected for subjects in follow-up experiencing \nnon-MACE AEs as these subjects can, and should, continue participation.\nRationale for Amendment\nUpdated section title to more accurately reflect the content of the section. Corrected language \naround early termination due to AEs. Renamed follow-up contact procedure to indicate flexibility \nin method of contacting subjects.\nPage 40, Section 8.1.1 Dosage Form, Manufacturing, Packaging, and Labeling\nPage 44, Section 8.1.3 Dose and Regimen\nExisting Text\nColchicine 0.6 mg tablets \n or URL Pharma, Inc. \n/ Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, Inc., Philadelphia, PA) will be supplied in child resistant \nbottles containing 100 tablets each.\nNaproxen (West-ward Pharmaceutical Corp., Eatontown, NJ) will be supplied in child resistant \nbottles with 100 tablets, each tablet containing 250 mg of naproxen.\nRevised Text\nColchicine 0.6 mg tablets \n or Takeda \nPharmaceuticals America, Deerfield, IL [formerly URL Pharma, Inc. / Mutual Pharmaceutical \nCompany, Inc., Philadelphia, PA]) will be supplied in child resistant bottles containing 100 tablets \neach.\nNaproxen (\n or \n \n India) will be supplied in child resistant bottles with 100 tablets, \neach tablet containing 250 mg of naproxen.\nRationale for Amendment\nTo reflect most recent manufacturing information.\nPPD\nPPD\nPPD\nPPD\nPPD\nFebuxostat\nStudy No. TMX-67_301\nPage 108 of 115\nProtocol Incorporating Amendment No. 6\n27 August 2013\nCONFIDENTIAL\nPage 46, Section 8.5 Unblinding Procedure\nPage 86, Appendix A Schedule of Study Procedures\nExisting Text\nTelephone Contact\nRevised Text\nFollow-up contact\nRationale for Amendment\nRenamed follow-up contact procedure to indicate flexibility in method of contacting subjects.\nPage 46, Section 8.5 Unblinding Procedure\nAdded Text\nFor unblinding a subject, the investigational drug blind can be obtained by accessing the IVRS. \nPlease refer to IVRS Unblinding Worksheet packet.\nRationale for Amendment\nAdded text to offer further guidance for finding instructions on how to unblind a subject in IVRS.\nPage 49, Section 9.1.6 Documentation of Concomitant Medications\nAdded Text\nChanges in medication for subjects that have discontinued treatment but remain in \nfollow-up should be recorded on the Medication Information Obtained During Follow-up \nContact eCRF, and not on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.\nRationale for Amendment\nProvide further clarification and reminder to users about where to properly record concomitant \nmedication information collected during follow-up contact calls.

Subjects will be contacted by telephone every 2 months (\u00b110 days) to \ndetermine if any potential CV events have occurred (see Section 7.5 for telephone contact details). \nIf the subject has had a potential CV event, he/she should bring the event related documents (labs, \nhospital discharge summary, etc) to the clinic. If after two attempts a subject cannot be reached \nthen the subject\u2019s emergency person will be contacted. Before a subject is considered lost to \nfollow-up, a minimum of two documented telephone contact attempts must have been made and \n1 certified letter must have been sent within 4 weeks of the most recently missed telephone call in \nan effort to contact the subject. Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study and \nexperience a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE will no longer be followed. \nFurther, at each telephone contact, sites will ask the subject if they have taken any new \nmedications (OTC or Prescription) since the last contact, or have stopped taking any ongoing \nmedications recorded at the last contact. If yes, the generic medication name, start date, end date \nand reason for use will be recorded on the eCRF.\nSites will also ask the subject at each telephone contact if they have had any SAEs or any potential \ncardiovascular adverse events since the last telephone contact. If yes, these will be recorded on the \nAE eCRF, and sites should follow the instructions in the Protocol Section 10.2.2, Collection and \nReporting of SAEs if applicable.

Added text to clarify when drug return is not applicable.\nPage 71, Section 10.2.5 Evaluation of CV Safety\nExisting Text\nEach death, all CV serious adverse events and selected non-serious adverse events which are \nconsidered by the investigator to be potentially of cardiovascular nature, including any medically \nsignificant updates, will be sent by Takeda to a blinded CV Endpoints committee (see \nSection 11.2) for adjudication. Potential non-serious (non-hospitalized) cardiovascular adverse \nevents may include, but are not limited to, events such as chest pain, angina, dyspnea/shortness of \nbreath, arrhythmias, and syncope.\nAll investigational sites will be required to collect relevant clinical information required for \nadjudication of all deaths, all SAEs and selected nonserious events that are considered by the \ninvestigator to be potentially of CV nature. The adjudication committee may also identify \nadditional events for adjudication through periodic data review. A CV worksheet will be provided \nto the investigational sites as a guide to ensure that supporting clinical information for each of \nthese events are collected and compiled by the site and forwarded by fax or mail to Takeda \nPharmacovigilance when available.
