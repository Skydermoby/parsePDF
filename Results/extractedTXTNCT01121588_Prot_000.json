Acceptable time windows for performing each \nassessment are described in the column headings.  All cycles are 21 days in duration. After completion of 7 cycles, ongoing patients will only need to visit the clinic every \nother cycle for study assessments instead of every cycle. Enough study medication for two cycles of treatment will be dispensed at each clinic visit.  During the non-visit \ncycle, patients must telephone the clinical site to provide an update of adverse events and concomitant medications and must still have required laboratory assessments \nperformed.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 11\nFootnotes for Schedule of Activities\n2.\nCycle 1/Day 1: Blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and physical examination not required if acceptable screening assessment is performed within 7 days prior to the \nstart of study treatment.\n3.\nEnd of Treatment/Withdrawal: Obtain these assessments if not completed during the previous 4 weeks on study (during the last 6 weeks for disease assessments).\n4.\nInformed Consent: Must be obtained prior to undergoing any trial specific procedure.\n5.\nMedical/Oncological history: To include information on prior regimens, surgery, and radiation.\n6.\nMandatory Tumor Tissue for Molecular Profiling: These samples will be initially analyzed at the investigational site for the assessment by one of the following1) ALK\ngene fusion by FISH, IHC and/or RT-PCR and sequencing, 2) ALK amplification events by FISH, qPCR, or aCGH, or 3) ALK activating point mutations determined by \ndirect sequencing The genotyping test employed for a selected sample will depend on the tumor type and expected ALK genetic event.  Subsequently the tumor samples \nmust be sent to the Pfizer designated central laboratory for confirmation, though this is not required for eligibility.  Paraffin block(s) of adequate size to allow if possible for \nat least 10 slides with cuts that are 5-microns thick.  If no block is available, then the sites should try to obtain, if possible, at least 10 slides with cuts that are 5-microns are \nacceptable.  Archived or fresh tumor samples are acceptable.  The mandatory tumor tissue may be obtained and analyzed outside of the 28 day screening window.\n7.\nPhysical Examination: includes an examination of major body systems, height (at screening only); weight, blood pressure and pulse rate \n8.\nOphthalmologic Examination: includes visual acuity and slit lamp and should be performed by an ophthalmologist.  The ophthalmologic examination should be repeated \nduring the study when clinically indicated, when visual disturbances have been observed or when there has been a reported change in CTCAE grade.\n9.\nHematology, Blood Chemistry and Coagulation: Required tests are listed in Appendix 1 of protocol. For patients on crizotinib therapy: If ALT Grade \uf0b33 or ALT \nGrade \uf0b32 and total bilirubin  Grade \uf0b32, then liver function tests need to be repeated every 48-72 hours until ALT Grade \uf0a32. Crizotinib therapy should be withheld; see \nTable 3.  A 4 ml serum sample obtained just prior to the first dose of study medication will be stored frozen on-site through completion of the study for possible use as a \nbaseline reference should additional laboratory tests be indicated, for example additional liver function testing to exclude drug induced liver injury (see Section 8 AE\nreporting).\n10. 12-lead ECG: See Section 7.2.6 for collection details.\n11. Pregnancy Test: All female patients of child-bearing potential are required to have a negative pregnancy test at screening.  The test should be repeated whenever one \nmenstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period or a potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. The test should also be repeated at the end of the study to \nconfirm the patient has not become pregnant during the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per the request of IRB/IECs or if required by local regulations.\n12. Tumor Assessments: RECIST 1.1 will be used to determine the solid tumor response, and the NCI International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (Cheson \ncriteria, 2007) will be used for NHL. For patients with non-hematologic malignancies, CT or MRI scans will include chest, brain, abdomen and pelvis at screening but \nsubsequently may include just involved sites of disease.  For patients with NHL, PET and CT or MRI or PET/CT may be used for NHL at baseline and for restaging.  Scans \nmust include chest, abdomen, pelvis and neck for NHL patients at baseline, but subsequently may include only known and suspected sites of disease.  Baseline PET \nscanning is required for all NHL patients.  For all tumor types, brain must be included in subsequent tumor assessments if a patient has brain metastases, otherwise brain \nwill only be evaluated when clinically indicated. Scans will be collected for a potential independent radiology review. CT or MRI scan should also be performed whenever \ndisease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration).  Bone scans are required if bone metastases are suspected.  A bone scan is also required at the time of \nconfirmation of response for patients who have bone metastases.\n13. Adverse Events: Patients must be followed for adverse events from the time they signed the informed consent until at least 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.  \nFollow-up by the Investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that \nassessment.  Serious adverse events should be monitored and reported from the time that the patient provides informed consent as described in the protocol.\n14. Concomitant Medications/Treatments: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and up to 28 days post \nthe last dose of study treatment.  \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 12\nFootnotes for Schedule of Activities\n15. Survival Follow-Up: After discontinuation of study treatment, post-study survival status will be collected every 2 months until death or until the last patient experiences \nprogressive disease on the study.  Includes collection of information on subsequent anticancer therapies.  Telephone contact is acceptable.\n16. Tumor Tissue for Molecular Profiling:  Sample will be sent to central laboratory (Section 7.5). An optional fresh tumor sample will be collected at the end of treatment if \na patient discontinues due to disease progression.\n17. Pharmacokinetics: See Section 7.3.2 for collection details.\n18. Dipstick Urinalysis and Reflex Microscopy:  In Korea, repeat exams should be completed at Day 1 of every cycle and at the end of treatment; all other countries should \nperform as clinically indicated (for example, upon diagnosis of renal cysts).  Reflex Microscopy required if urine dipstick is positive for blood or protein.  See Section 5.6.5\nfor further details.  \n19. Bone Marrow Aspirate and/or Biopsy: optional before study start and can be performed as clinically indicated during the study.  Required at end-of-treatment visit \n(ie, within 6 to 9 weeks after the last dose of investigational product, and must be \uf0b34 weeks from the last response assessment) for patients who otherwise meet the criteria \nfor a CR unless the patient had an adequate bone marrow biopsy which was negative for lymphoma and performed within 28 days before first dose of investigational \nproduct or unless the patient had previously undergone a bone marrow procedure confirming the CR.  \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 13\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLIST OF TABLES...................................................................................................................16\nAPPENDICES .........................................................................................................................17\n1.

Crizotinib (PF-02341066) Non-Clinical Data\nCrizotinib is a competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK and c-Met/HGFR receptor\ntyrosine kinase.  The rationale for use of this mechanism to treat cancer is supported by an \nemerging paradigm in oncology that robust clinical efficacy can be obtained with \nwell-tolerated inhibitors directed toward oncogenic tyrosine kinases that are genetically \naltered through activating mutations, gene translocations, or gene amplification.  Recent \nexamples include imatinib mesylate in gastrointestinal stromal tumors with mutant c-Kit or \nchronic myelogenous leukemia with BCR-Abl gene translocations, erlotinib in non-small cell \nlung cancer with mutant EGFR, tratuzumab in breast cancers with amplified HER-2/neu, and \nsunitinib targeting the VHL-dependent VEGF pathway in renal cell carcinoma.  Crizotinib\ndemonstrated activity against NPM-ALK, an oncogenic fusion protein variant of the ALK, \nwhich results from a chromosomal translocation which is implicated in the pathogenesis of \nhuman anaplastic large cell lymphoma.10 Consistent with its predicted mechanism of action, \ncrizotinib inhibited target-dependent tumor cell proliferation or invasion, induced tumor cell \napoptosis, and inhibited angiogenesis in nonclinical tumor models including neuroblastoma.  \nOral administration of crizotinib also demonstrated efficacy, including marked cytoreductive \nantitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met/HGFR or \nNPM-ALK.  The collective rationale for investigation of crizotinib in clinical studies is built \non genetic alteration of its molecular targets, its predicted ability to target multiple processes \nthat are common to cancer progression, and non-clinical efficacy data.  \n1.2.3. Crizotinib Clinical Data\nAn ongoing Phase 1 trial (A8081001) evaluating crizotinib as an oral single agent is being \nconducted to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with \nadvanced cancer (excluding leukemias).  This trial includes a dose escalation component \nfollowed by a dose expansion component in a selected cohort of molecularly-defined patients \nreferred to as the enriched population.  During the dose escalation phase, crizotinib was \nadministered under fasting conditions QD or BID on a continuous schedule.  The objectives \nof the dose escalation component of the trial were to establish the maximum tolerated dose \n(MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), and PK of crizotinib in patients with advanced \ncancer.  Enrollment for the dose escalation part of the trial is complete and 37 patients have \nbeen dosed.  Three DLTs were observed including Grade 3 ALT increase in 1 patient at\n200 mg QD and Grade 3 fatigue in 2 patients at 300 mg BID.  The MTD was determined to \nbe 250 mg BID administered in a continuous daily dosing regimen.  The most common \ntreatment-related adverse events seen to date were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and visual \ndisturbance, which were primarily Grade 1-2 in severity. Nausea and vomiting were \nindependent of dose or duration of treatment and were managed effectively using I.V. or oral \nanti-emetics. Treatment-related visual disturbances which consisted mainly of seeing \nshadows or streaks during changes in light were observed and occurred at doses of 200 mg \nBID or above.  All of these visual events were Grade 1 in severity.  In some patients, these \nevents resolved with continued treatment but are reversible upon discontinuation of \ncrizotinib.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 20\nIn a recent review of safety for crizotinib (PF-02341066) Pfizer has determined that there are \n4 potential cases of pneumonitis which may be related to crizotinib (PF-02341066). One \nsuch case was a radiation recall pneumonitis. Based on the other 3 cases that were not linked \nto radiation treatment and relative to all enrolled adult patients (N=273) who have been \ntreated with crizotinib (PF-02341066), as of July 16 2010, the current frequency of \nnon-radiation recall pneumonitis is 1.1%.  One of the 4 cases was fatal. The 3 other patients \nrecovered from the event. One patient experienced radiation recall pneumonitis, was \nappropriately treated and was able to restart crizotinib (PF-02341066). The other 2 patients \nwere permanently discontinued from crizotinib (PF-02341066). Interpretation of the \n3 non-radiation recall cases was complicated by the underlying non-small cell lung cancer for \nwhich the patients were being treated. In addition these 3 cases were complicated by the \nco-administration of other drugs known to potentially cause pneumonitis and/or other \npulmonary complications. One of the cases was considered not related to crizotinib \n(PF-02341066) by the investigator. Based on this new safety information suspected cases of \npneumonitis will be evaluated and patients with pre-existing interstitial fibrosis or interstitial \nlung disease will be excluded from the entering the study\nThe crizotinib adverse drug reaction (ADR) list was updated in the crizotinib Investigator\u2019s\nBrochure (IB) to include the development of complex renal cysts. The development of \ncomplex renal cysts has been reported in some patients with NSCLC treated with crizotinib. \nThese cysts may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and have developed from several weeks to \nseveral months after starting crizotinib. The precise nature and significance of these cysts is \nunclear; however, while no evidence of malignancy has been found based on aspiration of cyst \nfluid and biopsy in the reported cases, complex renal cysts may be associated with renal \nmalignancy, and thus consultation with a urologist or suitable alternate medical expert is \nrecommended. Neither renal impairment nor clinically relevant proteinuria has been observed in \nany of the cases.\nAdditionally, the IB has updated the Effects on the Liver Section 7.6.4. With more than \n1400 patients who have been treated with crizotinib in clinical trials, 2 new Hy's Law cases \nand 2 cases of fatal hepatic failure have recently (March 2012) been reported as serious \nadverse events related to crizotinib treatment (a fifth Hy\u2019s Law case had previously been \nreported in an earlier version of the IB).  Of all 5 of these cases, 2 patients presented with \nanorexia, 2 patients presented with weakness and fatigue, and 1 patient presented with \nabdominal pain. Four of these 5 cases, including the 2 fatal cases, were observed within the \nfirst 2 months after the start of crizotinib treatment, while significant transaminase elevation \nwas observed after 6 months of crizotinib treatment in the fifth case.  PK data are available \nfor the first 80 patients enrolled in the ongoing Phase 1 trial. After oral administration of \ncrizotinib single doses in the fasted state, peak plasma concentrations were reached at about \n4 hours and followed by a multi-exponential decline with an average terminal half-life of 43\nto 51 hours across doses.  Following multiple oral dosing for 15 days or longer, crizotinib\nAUCtau increased with median accumulation ratios ranging 1.7-3.4 after QD dosing and \n4.0-5.9 after BID dosing, respectively. The repeated administration at 250 mg BID for \n15 days or longer produced a median trough plasma concentration of 256 ng/mL (53 nM, free \ndrug), exceeding the target efficacious levels (Ceff) predicted for inhibition of cMet and ALK\nbased on preclinical mouse tumor models. Non-linearity of pharmacokinetics was observed \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 21\nat 50 and 100 mg QD doses as the AUCtau and Cmax increased more than proportionally with \nthe dose.  However, patients receiving doses ranging from 100 mg QD to 300 mg BID \ngenerally demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics, as evidenced by proportional increases in \nmean AUCtau and Cmax after single or multiple doses.\nCrizotinib showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A isozymes in human liver \nmicrosomes with a kinact of 0.11 min-1 and Ki of 3.0 \uf06dM.  In order to assess the effect of \ncrizotinib on CYP3A activity in the GI tract and the liver, the PK of midazolam (a CYP3A \nsubstrate probe) following a single oral 2 mg dose was evaluated before (Day -7) and after \n(Cycle 2 Day 1) repeated administration of crizotinib at 250 mg BID in 13 patients.  A \n3.6-fold (90% CI: 2.7-4.9) increase in the oral midazolam AUC was observed following \n28 days of crizotinib dosing at 250 mg BID, suggesting that crizotinib is a moderate inhibitor \nof CYP3A.\nResults from a pilot food effect study suggested that co-administration with a standard \nhigh-fat meal did not to change the geometric mean of AUC24 and Cmax of crizotinib\nfollowing single 250-mg crizotinib doses in cancer patients. \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066) has shown compelling clinical activity in patients with NSCLC \nwith EML4-ALK fusions events enrolled in the expanded cohort of a Phase 1 trial. In \n50 evaluable patients, an ORR of 64% and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 90% was reported \nby E.L. Kwak at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December of 2009. To \ndate, based on the Phase 1 study (A8081001), there is a limited patient experience in patients \nwith tumors other than NSCLC with changes in their molecular genetic profile involving the \nALK gene locus. One patient with IMT achieved a PR which has been ongoing for 1.5 years \n(1PR of 2 IMT patients enrolled) and one patient with adult neuroblastoma harboring an ALK\nmutation achieved stable disease (SD) lasting in excess of 6 months (1 SD of\n1 neuroblastoma patient enrolled). One patient with ALCL associated with ALK\ntranslocation has been studied to date but failed to achieve a clinical response. In addition, in \nan ongoing pediatric study there has been preliminary evidence of activity in a patient with \nIMT based on communication with the study principal investigator.  Complete information \non crizotinib (PF-02341066) may be found in the single reference safety document (SRSD), \nwhich for this study is the investigator\u2019s brochure (IB).\n2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS\n2.1. Objectives\nPrimary Objective:\n\uf0b7\nAssess the safety of oral single agent crizotinib administered to patients with \nadvanced ALK-positive ALCL or other advanced malignancy other than NSCLC \nknown to have an ALK genetic event and screen for efficacy in these patients.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 22\nSecondary Objectives:\n\uf0b7\nTo determine PK in this patient population using population PK (POPPK) methods \nand explore correlations between PK, response and/or safety findings.\n\uf0b7\nTo correlate ALK genetic events to outcome measures.\n2.2. Endpoints\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\uf0b7\nType, incidence, severity, seriousness and relationship to study medications of \nadverse events (AE) and any laboratory abnormalities.\n\uf0b7\nORR based on RECIST version 1.11 for solid tumors and the NCI International \nResponse Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for patients with ALCL or other \nNHL (2007)2\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\uf0b7\nPFS, OS at 6 months and 1 year, OS and DR.\n\uf0b7\nPlasma concentrations of crizotinib.\n\uf0b7\nProportion of patients with each of the ALK genetic events (translocation, mutation, \namplification).\n\uf0b7\nPhosphorylation status of ALK in the tumor samples from surgery or biopsy pre and \npost treatment when available.\n3. STUDY DESIGN\nThis is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm exploratory trial of an oral agent, crizotinib, in \npatients with advanced malignancy harboring a translocation, inversion, mutation or \namplification event involving the ALK gene locus.\nAt least 40 patients are expected to be enrolled into this trial. The sample size may be \nadjusted based on the number of patients identified and safety or evidence of antitumor \nefficacy within patient groups. In addition, the eligibility criteria may be modified to exclude \npatients based on the lack of efficacy demonstrated in specific patient groups.\nOnly ALK genetic event positive patients, as determined by the investigative site, may enter \nthe study. ALK translocation/fusion, amplification, mutation and overexpression can be \nassessed by using any of the available technologies including fluorescence in-situ \nhybridication (FISH), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction \n(qPCR), quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), array \nComparative Genomic Hybridication (aCGH) or direct sequencing. The methodology of \nALK testing required will depend entirely on the malignancy in question and the existence of \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 23\npublished data supporting a given methodology of ALK testing.  For example, ALCL is the \nonly disease for which IHC alone is acceptable to document ALK positivity, as IHC has been \nshown to correlate with ALK-fusion events in ALCL and is widely accepted as a means of \ndocumenting ALK positivity in ALCL.  For diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, IHC alone is not \nsufficient for enrollment; an ALK gene fusion event must be documented by FISH or PCR.  \nFor neuroblastoma, ALK gene amplification must be documented by either FISH or aCGH, \nor a known ALK activating point mutation must be documented by PCR or direct \nsequencing; IHC alone is not acceptable.  For inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), \nIHC alone is not sufficient, unless the intercalated antibody-enhanced polymer (iAEP) \nmethod is used.12  FISH or PCR demonstrating a fusion event is acceptable for IMT.  Other \ndiseases will be considered for enrollment if publications exist supporting ALK \nmutation/fusion/amplification as an oncogenic driver for the disease in question.\nPatients may continue treatment with crizotinib on this trial as long as there is evidence of \nclinical benefit in the judgment of the investigator. \n4.

Sunlight Exposure\nPatients treated with crizotinib should avoid sunbathing, prolonged unprotected sun \nexposure, or tanning for the duration of the study period.\n4.4.3. Alcohol Consumption\nPatients should be advised to avoid alcohol consumption while receiving crizotinib.\n4.5. Sponsor\u2019s Qualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the \nstudy is documented in the study contact list located in the Investigational Site Folder.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical \nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card.  The contact card contains, \nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number, \ncontact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event \nthat the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question \nor problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients \nparticipation in the study.  The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if \nthey are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in \nthe event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and \nthe study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the \nestablished communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for \nadvice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study.  The help desk \nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they \nwill be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. STUDY TREATMENTS\n5.1. Allocation to Treatment\nAll patients will receive crizotinib.\n5.2. Drug Supplies\n5.2.1. Formulation and Packaging\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066) will be provided as capsules containing 200 mg or 250 mg of \nstudy medication and will be packaged in HDPE bottles.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 29\n5.2.2. Preparation and Dispensing\nThe study medication should be dispensed at each visit according to the schedule of \ntreatment administration (Section 5.2.3).  Dispensing will be done by a qualified staff \nmember in bottles provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule. The \npatient/caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in the bottle provided \nthroughout the course of dosing and return the bottle to the site at the next study visit. \nOnly qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to \nthem and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of \nchemotherapeutic agents.\n5.2.3. Administration\nCrizotinib (PF-2341066), 250 mg BID, will be administered orally at approximately the same \ntime each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule, ie, no break in dosing. Crizotinib may \nbe taken without regard to meals. Cycles are defined in 21-day periods to facilitate \nscheduling of visits and assessments.\nPatients will swallow the study medication whole and will not manipulate or chew the \nmedication prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed that if they vomit anytime after \ntaking a dose, then they must not \u201cmake it up\u201d with an extra dose, but instead resume \nsubsequent doses as prescribed.  Any missed dose may be taken up to 6 hours prior to the \nnext scheduled dose, otherwise it should be skipped and dosing resumed with subsequent \ndoses as prescribed.\n5.2.4. Compliance\nPatients receiving crizotinib will be required to return all bottles of study medication at the \nbeginning of each cycle or every other cycle if beyond Cycle 7.  The number of capsules\nremaining will be documented and recorded.\n5.3. Drug Storage \nThe investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all \ninvestigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under \nrecommended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nInvestigational product should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the \ndrug label.  \nStorage conditions stated in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) (ie, IB), will be \nsuperseded by storage conditions stated in the labeling.\nReturned medication for crizotinib should be stored separately from medication that needs to \nbe dispensed.  Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported \nupon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to labeled \nstorage conditions, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, including \nany actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.  \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 30\nOnce an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used \nuntil the Sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  It \nwill not be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the \ninvestigational product after the temperature excursion.  Use of the investigational product \nprior to sponsor approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding \ninformation the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site. \nReceipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where \nthe product(s) are briefly out of labeled temperature range are not considered excursions.\nSite staff will instruct patients on the storage requirements for take home medications \nincluding how to report temperature excursions.\n5.4. Drug Accountability\nThe Investigator\u2019s site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or \nother disposition of the drug supplies.  All containers must be returned to the Investigator by \nthe patient.  \nThe Sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational \nproduct (eg, at the site).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the study site, the \ninvestigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable \nenvironmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by \nPfizer and all destruction must be adequately documented.\nTo ensure adequate records, crizotinib will be accounted for in the case report form (CRF) \nand drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by the sponsor.  Unless otherwise \nauthorized, at the end of the clinical trial, all crizotinib supplies unallocated or unused by the \npatients must be returned to the sponsor or its designee.  \n5.5. Dose Modifications\nEvery effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.\nIn the event of significant toxicity, dosing may be delayed and/or reduced as described \nbelow.  In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst \ntoxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify their investigators at the first \noccurrence of any adverse event.  \nDose modifications may occur in 3 ways:\n\uf0b7\nWithin a cycle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and dose reduction, if \nrequired, during a given treatment cycle; \n\uf0b7\nBetween cycles: next cycle administration may be delayed due to persisting toxicity \nwhen a new cycle is due to start;\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 31\n\uf0b7\nIn the next cycle: dose reduction may be required in a subsequent cycle based on \ntoxicity experienced in the previous cycle.\nPatients will be monitored closely for toxicity and the dose of crizotinib may be adjusted as \nindicated in Table 3.  Dosing interruption and/or intrapatient dose reduction by 1 and if \nneeded, 2 dose level(s) will be allowed depending on the type and severity of toxicity \nencountered (Dose Level -1 is 200 mg BID; Dose Level -2 is 250 mg QD).  Management of \npatients requiring more than 2 dose reductions due to treatment-related toxicity should be \ndiscussed with the Sponsor.\nInvestigators are encouraged to employ best supportive care according to local institutional \nclinical practices and according to the guidance for selected adverse events provided below.  \n5.6. Management of Selected Crizotinib-Related Adverse Events\nInvestigators are encouraged to employ best supportive care according to local institutional \nclinical practices and according to the guidance for selected adverse events provided below.\n5.6.1. Nausea and Vomiting\nStandard anti-emetics such as prochlorperazine or ondansetron may be used for the treatment \nof vomiting.  Taking the medication with food may reduce nausea.  Prophylactic anti-emetics \nmay be used.\n5.6.2. Diarrhea\nCTCAE Grade 1: Symptomatic care such as loperamide (Imodium) or no intervention at \ninvestigator judgment. \nCTCAE Grade 2: Loperamide (4 mg at first onset, then 2 mg every 2-4 hours until symptom \nfree for 12 hours). No dose modification unless patient is intolerant or symptom is recurrent. \nCTCAE Grades 3-4 (despite use of loperamide): Withhold treatment until recovery to \nGrade \uf0a31.\n5.6.3. Bradycardia\nFor a heart rate <40 beats per minute, evaluate the patient fully including an assessment of \nconcomitant medications.  Adjust the dosage of any medication known to be associated with \nbradycardia (eg, beta-blockers).  If the bradycardia is symptomatic at any time or does not \nimprove within 7 days of adjusting the concomitant medications, hold crizotinib dosing until \nrecovery to Grade \uf0a31.  Patient may continue treatment only with the agreement of both the \nsponsor and investigator. After IRB/EC approval of Amendment 5, concurrent use of \ncrizotinib with other bradycardic agents (eg, beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium \nchannel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem, clonidine, digoxin) should be avoided to \nthe extent possible due to the increased risk of symptomatic bradycardia.  Heart rate and \nblood pressure should be monitored regularly.  Dose modification is not required in case of \nasymptomatic bradycardia. For management of patients who develop symptomatic \nbradycardia, see Table 3. \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 32\n5.6.4. Pneumonitis\nInvestigators must evaluate thoroughly patients who demonstrate potential signs/symptoms \nof pneumonitis/pneumonia. If a patient has a potential diagnosis of pneumonitis or drug-\nrelated lung injury the following evaluations/procedures should be considered to confirm or \nexclude the diagnosis of pneumonitis during this period in the absence of tumor progression \nin the lungs, other pulmonary disease, infection, or radiation effects: \n\uf0b7\nA sputum gram stain and culture (induced sputum if needed) bacterial, viral, fungal, \nprotozoal, and mycobacterial pathogens;\n\uf0b7\nBlood culture should be performed in febrile patients.  Consider appropriate \nserologies (mycoplasma, legionella, CMV, other viruses, etc.)\n\uf0b7\nThoracentesis if pleural fluid is present (culture, microbiology, cytology).\n\uf0b7\nBronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) if appropriate.

Renal Cysts\nThe development of complex renal cysts has been reported in some patients with NSCLC \ntreated with crizotinib.  These cysts may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and have\ndeveloped from 2 and 6 months after starting crizotinib.  The precise nature and significance \nof these cysts is unclear; however, while no evidence of malignancy has been found based on \naspiration of cyst fluid and biopsy in the reported cases, complex renal cysts may be \nassociated with renal malignancy, and thus consultation with a urologist or suitable alternate \nmedical expert is recommended.  \n\uf0b7\nActive surveillance with appropriate imaging (contrast-enhanced CT scanning or \nmagnetic resonance imaging) should be performed at the time of the renal cysts \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 33\ndiagnosis and as scheduled per protocol.

Concomitant Medication(s)\nAll concomitant treatments, blood products, as well as non-drug interventions \n(eg, paracentesis) received by patients from screening to 28 days after the last dose of study \ntreatment will be recorded on the CRF.\nSystemic anticancer therapy with agents other than crizotinib (including corticosteroids for \nlymphoma) is not allowed.  Medications intended solely for supportive care (ie, antiemetics, \nanalgesics, megestrol acetate for anorexia) are allowed.  \n5.7.1. Crizotinib\nThe metabolism of crizotinib is predominantly mediated by the CYP3A isozymes in human \nliver microsomes and hepatocytes.  Co-administration with drugs that are CYP3A inhibitors \nand inducers may change the plasma concentrations of crizotinib in humans.  The concurrent \nuse of potent CYP3A inhibitors, including but not limited to atazanavir, clarithromycin, \nindinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, \ntelithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice are not \nallowed in the study.  The topical use of these medications (if applicable), such as 2% \nketoconazole cream, may be allowed.  The concurrent use of potent CYP3A inducers,\nincluding but not limited to carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, \nand St. John\u2019s wort, are not allowed in the study.\nIn vitro data indicate that the most pronounced inhibitory potential of crizotinib was observed \ntoward CYP3A4 (testosterone)-mediated drug metabolism.  Crizotinib has minimal potential \nto inhibit other human CYP isoforms such as CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6.  \nCrizotinib also showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A isozymes in human liver \nmicrosomes.  In cancer patients, a mean 3.6-fold (90% CI: 2.7-4.9) increase in the oral \nmidazolam AUC was observed following 28 days of crizotinib dosing at 250 mg BID, \nsuggesting that crizotinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A.  Caution must be exercised in \npatients receiving crizotinib in combination with drugs that are predominantly metabolized \nby CYP3A, such as alfentanil, cyclosporine, fentanyl, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus.  \nIn particular, co-administration of crizotinib with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow \ntherapeutic indices including, but not limited to, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, pimozide, \nastemizole*, cisapride*, and terfenadine* (* withdrawn from U.S. market) must be avoided \nfrom the time of the first dose of crizotinib until treatment discontinuation.\nAdditionally, the concurrent use of non-prescription drugs, complimentary medicines\n(excluding vitamins) or herbal supplements is not recommended. Patients should avoid using \nacetaminophen at doses in excess of 2 grams per day.\n5.7.2. Antiemetic and Antidiarrheal Therapy\nSupportive care may include premedication with antiemetics to limit treatment-related nausea \nand vomiting.  Patients may receive prophylaxis of treatment-induced diarrhea.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 39\n5.7.3. Hematopoietic Growth Factors\nThe use of hematopoietic growth factors is at the discretion of the treating physician and is in \nline with local regulatory guidelines.  Patients who enter the study on stable doses of \nerythropoietin or darbepoietin may continue this treatment, and patients may start either drug \nduring the study at the discretion of the treating physician.  Patients with neutropenic fever or \ninfection should be treated promptly and may receive therapeutic colony-stimulating factors \nif appropriate.\n5.7.4. Other Concomitant Medications\nAnti-inflammatory or narcotic analgesics may be offered as needed.  Packed red blood cell \nand platelet transfusions should be administered as clinically indicated.\nPatients on this trial may be supported with appropriate hormone replacement therapy as \nclinically indicated in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable \ntreatment-associated toxicity.\nBisphosphonate therapy for metastatic bone disease is permitted.  Bisphosphonate therapy \nshould be given as per local medical practice.\nLow dose acetaminophen (<2 g/day) is allowed.\nMedications that are known to prolong the QT interval and bradycardic agents \n(eg, beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and \ndiltiazem, clonidine, digoxin) should be used with caution during the study.\n5.8. Concomitant Radiotherapy or Surgery\nPalliative radiotherapy to specific sites of disease is permitted if considered medically \nnecessary by the treating physician.  All attempts should be made to rule out disease \nprogression in the event of increased localized pain.  Crizotinib treatment should be \ninterrupted during palliative radiotherapy \u2013 stopping 1 day before and resuming treatment \n1 day after.\nThe effect of crizotinib in wound healing is not known and has not been investigated; \ntherefore, caution is advised on theoretical grounds (potential antiangiogenic effect) for any \nsurgical procedures during the study.  The appropriate interval of time between surgery and \ncrizotinib required to minimize the risk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been \ndetermined.  In the event elective surgery is necessary during study participation, crizotinib\ndosing should be stopped 48 hours before surgery and resumed no sooner than 48 hours after \nsurgery.  Postoperatively, the decision to reinitiate crizotinib treatment should be based on a \nclinical assessment of satisfactory wound healing and recovery from surgery.\n5.9.

Screening\nSee Table 1 for Schedule of Activities.\n6.2. Study Period\nFor procedures during the study period, see Table 1 for Schedule of Activities.  A reduced \nschedule of assessments will be followed for all ongoing patients after IRB/EC approval of \nAmendment 5 (see Table 6, Appendix 5).\nSufficient study medication for a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment will be dispensed at each \nclinic visit. During the non-clinical visit cycles, laboratory tests should be performed every \ncycle and the Investigator is responsible for ensuring the patient contacts the clinical site in \norder to provide an update of adverse events and concomitant medications.  Where possible, \nlaboratory tests should be performed at the clinical site\u2019s local laboratory. Where that is not \npossible, patients will provide the laboratory test results carried out at a non-clinical site \nlaboratory, eg, by telephone, and bring a copy of the laboratory test results at the next cycle \nvisit; process depends on local medical practice.  The copy of the laboratory test results must \nbe retained in the patient\u2019s file at the clinical site for documentation purposes.\n6.3. Follow-Up Visit\nFor follow-up visit procedures, see Table 1. After IRB/EC approval of Amendment #5, \npost-treatment follow-up visits for survival status will no longer be required (see Table 6, \nAppendix 5).\n6.4. Patient Withdrawal\nPatients may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be \nwithdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral\nreasons, or the inability of the patient to comply with the protocol-required schedule of study \nvisits or procedures at a given study site.  \nReasons for trial treatment discontinuation may include (further collection of data can still \noccur):\n\uf0b7\nDisease progression by RECIST 1.11 or NCI International Response Criteria for \nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (2007).2\n\uf0b7\nUnacceptable toxicity.\n\uf0b7\nNeed for treatment delay for more than 6 weeks due to lack of toleration should be \ndiscussed with the sponsor.\n\uf0b7\nProtocol non-compliance.\n\uf0b7\nPregnancy.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 41\nReasons for trial discontinuations (no further collection of data) withdrawal from study \nfollow up may include:\n\uf0b7\nWithdrawal of consent.\n\uf0b7\nPatient lost to follow-up (data may still be collected from other sources, eg, vital \nrecords, as allowed by local regulations.\n\uf0b7\nDeath.\n\uf0b7\nStudy terminated by Sponsor.\nIf a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the \npatient. All attempts to contact the patient and information received during contact attempts \nmust be documented in the patient\u2019s medical record. In any circumstance, every effort \nshould be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire \nabout the reason for withdrawal, request the patient to return all unused investigational \nproduct(s), request the patient to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow-up with the \npatient regarding any unresolved adverse events.\nIf the patient refuses further visits, the patient should continue to be followed for survival \nunless the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information or for further \ncontact.  In this case, no further study-specific evaluations should be performed, and no \nadditional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data \ncollected before such withdrawal of consent. \nNote: after IRB/EC approval of Amendment #5, post-treatment follow-up visits for survival \nstatus will no longer be required.  \n7. ASSESSMENTS\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are \ncompleted as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be \ncircumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to \nperform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the \nsafety and well being of the patient.  When a protocol required test can not be performed the \ninvestigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions \nwhich he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. \nThe study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.\nAssessment of efficacy, adverse events, laboratory safety assessment (hematology, \ncoagulation, and chemistry), physical examination, ECG, tumor measurements, biomarker \nsampling and PK sampling will be done according to time points specified in Table 1.\nAfter IRB/EC approval of Amendment #5, Schedule of Activities will be further reduced as \nindicated in Table 6 (Appendix 5).\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 42\n7.1. Efficacy Assessments\nOn-study tumor assessments are to be performed at the beginning of Cycle 3 and every other \ncycle up to and including Cycle 10.  After Cycle 10 tumor assessments will be performed \nevery 12 weeks, and will be reduced to every 24 weeks from Cycle \uf0b326 and to every\n52 weeks from Cycle \uf0b352.  CT or MRI scan should also be performed whenever disease \nprogression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration).  The determination of anti-tumor \nactivity will be based on objective tumor assessments made according to the RECIST version \n1.1 or NCI International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (2007)\n(Appendix 3 and Appendix 4).  The CT scans used for tumor assessments should be \nperformed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons. The same \nimaging modality should be used throughout the study to measure disease.  Tumor evaluation \nby positron emission tomography (PET) scan or by ultrasound may not substitute for CT or \nMRI scans.  CT or MRI scans will include chest, abdomen and pelvis at screening (and neck \nfor patients with NHL).  Subsequent staging scans may include only known sites of disease, \nunless scanning of additional sites is clinically indicated. CT/MRI head is required at \nscreening. Brain must be included in subsequent tumor assessments if a patient has brain \nmetastases, otherwise brain will only be evaluated when clinically indicated. Bone scans are \nrequired if bone metastases are suspected.  A bone scan is also required at the time of \nconfirmation of response for patients who have bone metastases.  Scans will be collected for \na potential independent radiology review.  PET scanning should be used to evaluate for \ncomplete response in those NHL patients whose CT/MRI scans suggest only a partial \nresponse.  Once a normal PET scan (ie, a PET scan suggesting complete response) has been \nobtained in a patient with NHL, repeat PET scanning is not required unless there is clinical \nevidence to suggest disease progression.  Bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate should also be \nperformed to document complete response for any NHL patients known to have bone \nmarrow involvement at baseline or for any NHL patient whose marrow status was unknown \nat baseline.  \nWhen new effusions or ascites are present and represent the only potential site of disease \nprogression, cytologic analysis should be performed and the results, malignant or \nnon-malignant, should be recorded on the CRF.\nMeasurable lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered target lesions \nunless increase in size has been observed following completion of radiation therapy.\nAfter IRB/EC approval of Amendment #5, tumor assessments will be performed as per local \nclinical practice (see Table 6, Appendix 5), and will no longer be recorded on the CRF. The \ncollection of scans for independent radiology review will be discontinued. However, tumor \nassessment information should be retained in the patient\u2019s file for documentation purposes.\n7.2. Safety Assessments\nSafety assessments will include collection of AEs, serious adverse events, vital signs, \nphysical examination, 12-lead ECGs, laboratory assessments including pregnancy tests, \nophthalmological examinations and verification of concomitant treatments.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 43\n7.2.1. Adverse Events \nAdverse events will be classified by type, incidence, severity (graded by the National Cancer \nInstitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Version 4.0), timing, \nseriousness, and relatedness.\nBaseline tumor-related signs and symptoms will be recorded as adverse events during the \ntrial if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.\n7.2.2. Pregnancy Testing\nPrior to IRB/EC approval of Amendment 5, for female patients of childbearing potential, \napregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be done at screening, before \ninvestigational product administration, whenever one menstrual cycle is missed during the \ntreatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), and at the end of \ntreatment visit to confirm the patient has not become pregnant during the study.\nAfter IRB/EC approval of Amendment 5, for female patients of childbearing potential, a \nserum pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be routinely performed at \nevery cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study treatment, and additionally \nwhenever one menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  \nIn the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the patient will be withdrawn from treatment \nbut may remain in the study.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested \nby IRB/ECs or if required by local regulations.\n7.2.3. Laboratory Safety Assessments\nFor a listing of hematology, coagulation and blood chemistries, see Appendix 1.\n7.2.4. Physical Examination\nA complete physical examination will include the assessment of relevant body systems, the \nmeasurement of body weight, height (screening only) and vital signs.  Blood pressure and \npulse rate will be obtained in the sitting position.  Blood pressure should be measured in the \ndominant arm, ie, writing arm, and recorded to the nearest mmHg.  The same arm should be \nused throughout the study.\n7.2.5. Performance Status\nECOG Performance Status scale will be used (see Appendix 2).\n7.2.6. ECG Measurements\nA 12-lead (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be used for all ECGs.  Triplicate ECG \nmeasurements will be obtained at all time points except a single ECG measurement at \nscreening. For triplicate measures, three consecutive 12-lead ECGS will be collected \napproximately 2 minutes apart.  It is required that the machine used has a capacity to \ncalculate the standard intervals automatically.  ECG measurements will include PR interval, \nQT interval, RR interval, and QRS complex.  Additional ECGs will be performed as \nclinically indicated. If the QTc is prolonged (\uf0b3500 msec), then the ECG should be read by a \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 44\ncardiologist at the site for confirmation, and the values obtained by the cardiologist should \nalso be entered into the CRF.  Crizotinib should be withheld until the drug relationship of the \nevent is determined (rule out electrolyte imbalance or influence of concomitant medication).  \nIn case of a QTc interval measurement \uf0b3500 msec (Grade \uf0b33) dosing should be interrupted, \nand permanently discontinued for a Grade 4 QTc prolongation.  For Grade 3 or 4 QTc \nprolongations, continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring will be done under physician \nsupervision until the QTc recovers to Grade \uf0a31.  Triplicate ECG surveillance will again be \nperformed when crizotinib is restarted on a reduced dose due to Grade 3 QTc prolongation as \ndescribed in Table 3. The timing of the triplicate assessment of ECGs should be prior to \n(0 hour) and 2-6 hours after morning dosing of crizotinib on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3.\n7.2.7. Ophthalmology Examinations\nAt screening, each patient will have an ophthalmologic exam including visual acuity and slit \nlamp.  Additional eye examinations will be performed as clinically indicated.\nFindings from the ophthalmology examinations should be reported as adverse events if a \nfinding is considered to be an adverse event by the investigator or Sponsor.\n7.3. Pharmacokinetics\n7.3.1. Plasma Pharmacokinetic Assessment\nAll efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the exact nominal time \nrelative to dosing. However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within \n6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) from dosing will not be captured as a protocol deviation, as \nlong as the exact time of the sample collection is noted on the source document and data \ncollection tool (eg, CRF).  During the trial, actual collection times may change but the \nnumber of samples will remain the same.  \nPK samples will be assayed using validated analytical method(s) in compliance with Pfizer \nstandard operating procedures.  Details regarding the sample handling and shipping will be \nprovided in the Lab Manual.\n7.3.2. Plasma Pharmacokinetic Assessment for Crizotinib\nPlasma samples for crizotinib will be obtained prior to and 2-6 hours following morning \ndosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 and 5.  No pre-dose sample is required on Day 1 of \nCycle 1. Additional blood samples may be requested from patients experiencing unexpected \nor serious adverse events.\nAs part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the study drug, samples may be used for \npotential qualitative and/or quantitative metabolite analyses and/or evaluation of the \nbioanalytical methods for crizotinib and its metabolites (if possible). The results of such \nanalyses may be included in the clinical report.\nAt each time point, blood samples (3 mL) for PK will be collected into appropriately labeled \ncollection tubes containing K2EDTA at protocol-specified times. Once collected, samples \nshould be processed immediately and kept out of direct sunlight due to the light sensitive \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 45\nnature of crizotinib.  Blood samples will be placed immediately on ice-bath and centrifuged \nat approximately 1700 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00ba C. Plasma samples will be harvested and stored \nin appropriately labeled tubes at approximately -20\u00b0C within 1 hour of collection.  \n7.4. Tumor Tissue for Molecular Profiling\nTumor sample must be provided to the designated central laboratory for retrospective \nconfirmation of ALK genetic event by a Pfizer designated central laboratory. However this \ninformation will not be used to determine eligibility to enter the trial.\n7.5. Tumor Tissue for Biomarker Analysis \nAn optional tumor sample will be collected at the end of treatment if a patient discontinues \ndue to disease progression.  The tumor tissue will be used to determine possible mechanisms \nfor resistance to crizotinib treatment.  There is no restriction on the type of tumor sample, so \ncytology specimens as an alternative to solid tumor specimens may also be collected.\n8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal \nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following \nsections. \nFor all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to \ndetermine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for \nclassification as a serious adverse event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or \nits designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient information should be \nobtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the adverse event.  The investigator \nis required to assess causality.  Follow-up by the investigator may be required until the event \nor its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs \nwith that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event \nthat is determined by the Sponsor to be serious will be reported by the Sponsor as an SAE.  \nTo assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from \nthe investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical \ntrial.  \n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor serious adverse events, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated \nrepresentative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is \nobtained prior to the patient\u2019s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any \nstudy-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including \n28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product.  Serious adverse \nevents occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to \nthe Sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 46\nevents that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to \ninvestigational product are to be reported to the Sponsor.\n\uf0b7\nAdverse events (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the case report form \n(CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of investigational product \nthrough the patient\u2019s last visit.\n\uf0b7\nIf a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period for \nnon-serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must \nbe reported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last \ndose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient\nadministered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal \nrelationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not \nlimited to:  \n\uf0b7\nAbnormal test findings;\n\uf0b7\nClinically significant symptoms and signs;\n\uf0b7\nChanges in physical examination findings;\n\uf0b7\nHypersensitivity;\n\uf0b7\nDrug abuse;\n\uf0b7\nDrug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\n\uf0b7\nDrug overdose;\n\uf0b7\nDrug withdrawal;\n\uf0b7\nDrug misuse; \n\uf0b7\nDrug interactions;\n\uf0b7\nExtravasation;\n\uf0b7\nExposure during pregnancy (EDP);\n\uf0b7\nExposure via breast feeding;\n\uf0b7\nMedication error;\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 47\n\uf0b7\nOccupational exposure;\n\uf0b7\nWorsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported \nas adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed \nby measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be \nreported as adverse events.\n8.4. Medication Errors\nMedication errors may result, in this study, from the administration or consumption of the \nwrong product, by the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  \nSuch medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication \nerror CRF which is a specific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when \nappropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified \nimmediately.\nMedication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, \nincluding:\n\uf0b7\nMedication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product;\n\uf0b7\nPotential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do \nor do not involve the participating patient.\nWhether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the \ninvestigator, the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page \nand, if applicable, any associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.\n8.5. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as \nan adverse event are as follows: \n\uf0b7\nTest result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, \nand/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, \nsignificant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result is considered to be an adverse event by the investigator or sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not \nconstitute an adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does \nnot require reporting as an adverse event.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 48\n8.6. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:\n\uf0b7\nResults in death;\n\uf0b7\nIs life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n\uf0b7\nRequires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n\uf0b7\nResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the \nability to conduct normal life functions);\n\uf0b7\nResults in congenital anomaly/birth defect;\n\uf0b7\nProgression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of \nprogression) should not be reported as a serious adverse event unless the outcome is \nfatal within the safety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of \ndisease progression should not be reported as a serious adverse event. If the \nmalignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the safety reporting period, \nthen the event leading to death must be recorded as an adverse event and as a serious \nadverse event with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)\nGrade 5 (see the section on Severity Assessment).\n\uf0b7\nLack of efficacy should be reported as an adverse event when it is associated with a \nserious adverse event.\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important \nmedical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or \nresult in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize \nthe patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse event outcomes, \nthe important medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for \nallergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization,\nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.6.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events \nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported by the \ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety \ndatabase (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).\n8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury \nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria \noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 49\ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy\u2019s law cases) and should always be considered \nimportant medical events.  \nThe threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury \ndepends on the patient\u2019s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Patients who \npresent with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to \ndefinitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:\n\uf0b7\nPatients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range \nwho subsequently present with AST or ALT values \uf0b33 times the upper limit of \nnormal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value \uf0b32 X ULN with no evidence \nof hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value \uf0a32 X ULN or not available;\n\uf0b7\nFor patients with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper \nlimit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition \nmentioned above:\n\uf0b7\nFor patients with pre-existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal \nrange: AST or ALT \uf0b32 times the baseline values and \uf0b33 X ULN, or \n\uf0b38 X ULN (whichever is smaller).\n\uf0b7\nConcurrent with\n\uf0b7\nFor patients with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: \nTotal bilirubin increased from baseline by an amount of at least one time the \nupper limit of normal or if the value reaches \uf0b33 times the upper limit of \nnormal (whichever is smaller).\nThe patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, \npreferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should \ninclude laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessment.  For oncology studies, the \npossibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered.  \nIn addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include \nalbumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl \ntransferase, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline \nphosphatase.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, \nacetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational \nexposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, \nblood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  \nFurther testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) \nmay be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria \ndefined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at \nthe time should be considered potential Hy\u2019s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the \nresults of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such \npotential Hy\u2019s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 50\n8.7. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or \nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation to an existing admission.  Admission also \nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric \nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a \ntuberculosis unit).  An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; \nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical \nimportance. \nHospitalization does not include the following:\n\uf0b7\nRehabilitation facilities;\n\uf0b7\nHospice facilities;\n\uf0b7\nRespite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n\uf0b7\nSkilled nursing facilities;\n\uf0b7\nNursing homes;\n\uf0b7\nSame day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical \nadverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include: \n\uf0b7\nAdmission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the \ndevelopment of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition \n(eg, for work-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratory abnormality);\n\uf0b7\nSocial admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);\n\uf0b7\nAdministrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);\n\uf0b7\nProtocol-specified admission during a study (eg, for a procedure required by the study \nprotocol);\n\uf0b7\nOptional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical adverse event (eg, for \nelective cosmetic surgery);\n\uf0b7\nHospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n\uf0b7\nPre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline \ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n\uf0b7\nAdmission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 51\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not \nbe reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was \nperformed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an \nacute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as \nthe adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the \nadverse event.\n8.8. Severity Assessment\nThe investigator will use the following definitions of Severity in accordance with CTCAE\nVersion 4.0 to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event.  If the event is serious, \nthe CTC grade reported in the adverse event CRF must be consistent with the description of \nCTC grade included in the narrative section of the serious adverse event report.\nGRADE\nClinical Description of Severity\n0 \nNo Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in \nthe Version 4.0 CTCAE document but may be used in certain circumstances).\n1\nMILD Adverse Event\n2\nMODERATE Adverse Event\n3\nSEVERE Adverse Event\n4\nLIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\n5\nDEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe \nevent is not necessarily a serious adverse event.  For example, a headache may be severe \n(interferes significantly with patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious \nunless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.\n8.9. Causality Assessment\nThe investigator\u2019s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events (serious \nand non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as \nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting \nrequirements if applicable.  An investigator\u2019s causality assessment is the determination of \nwhether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or \ncontributed to an adverse event; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a \ncausal relationship should be provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the \ninvestigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as \u201crelated to \ninvestigational product\u201d for reporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor (see the section on \nReporting Requirements).  If the investigator's causality assessment is \"unknown but not \nrelated to investigational product\", this should be clearly documented on study records.  \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 52\nIn addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study \nprocedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and \nCRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse \nevent reporting requirements, if applicable.\n8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during \npregnancy occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been \ndirectly exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the \ninvestigational product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after \ndiscontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product;\nAn example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with \na Pfizer product in a pregnant women (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has \nbeen exposed to chemotherapeutic products).\n2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the \ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed \nduring his partner\u2019s pregnancy.\nIf a study patient or study patient\u2019s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the \nstudy patient\u2019s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this \ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a SAE Report form and Exposure during\npregnancy (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In \naddition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a \nPfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been \nexposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EDP supplemental form.  \nThis must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of \nawareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of \ndelivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for \nall EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until \ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up \nto the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the \nneonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for \ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the \nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test \nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, \nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a \nlive born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the \ninvestigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 53\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: \n\uf0b7\nSpontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\n\uf0b7\nNeonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard \nto causality, as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as \nserious adverse events when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or \npossibly related to exposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the \ninvestigator.  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis \n(eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal \nexposure, the investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of \nInformation Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source \ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to \nprovide to his partner.\n8.11. Occupational Exposure \nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person \n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the \ninvestigational product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the \ninvestigator\u2019s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an \nassociated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study, \nthe information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed SAE report form \nis maintained in the investigator site file.\n8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also the Section on Patient Withdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other \ncauses, according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the \nappropriate adverse event CRF page.  \nWhen a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with \nthe reporting requirements defined below.\n8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events \nspontaneously reported by the study patient.  In addition, each study patient will be \nquestioned about adverse events.\n8.14. Reporting Requirements\nEach adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse \nevents.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and \ninternational regulations, as appropriate.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 54\n8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf a serious adverse event occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator \nawareness of the event.  \nIn particular, if the serious adverse event is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer \nmust be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information.  \nThis timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously \nforwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of \nexposure during pregnancy, exposure via breastfeeding, and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious \nadverse event immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment \nelsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and \ndocument the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.\nFor all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information \nto Pfizer in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an \ninvestigator may be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in \nan expedited fashion.  This information collected for serious adverse events is more detailed \nthan that captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, this will include a \ndescription of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical \nassessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Information on \nother possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines and/or illnesses \nmust be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings \nmust be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated representative. \n8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  It should be \nnoted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the \nadverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a \nconsistent manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms.  \nAdverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as \non the form for collection of SAE information.\n8.14.3. Sponsor\u2019s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAdverse events reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be \ncarried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\n9.1. Sample Size Determination\nA primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of oral, single agent crizotinib\nadministered to patients with advanced ALCL or other malignancy (other than NSCLC) \nknown to have an ALK genetic event and screen for efficacy in these patients.  Estimation \nwill be emphasized for the study endpoints. \n",

Severity of the AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.  \nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced any serious AE (SAE), treatment \nrelated AE, and treatment related SAE will also be summarized.  AE data will be presented \nacross cycles and by cycle, as appropriate.  The denominator for each cycle is defined as \nthose patients available at the start of the cycle who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib for \nthat cycle.  Emphasis in the analyses will be placed on AEs classified as treatment emergent.  \nAdditional summaries of AEs and other safety data will be presented in tabular and/or \ngraphical format and summarized descriptively, as appropriate.\n9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints\nSecondary, time to event endpoints (eg, PFS, OS), will be summarized descriptively using \nKaplan-Meier methods and displayed graphically, where appropriate.  \n9.3. Analysis of Other Endpoints\n9.3.1. Study Conduct and Patient Disposition\nAn accounting of the study patients will be tabulated.  Patients not meeting the eligibility \ncriteria will be identified.  Patients not completing the study will be listed along with the \nreason for their premature discontinuation.  Reasons for premature discontinuation will be \nsummarized.\n9.3.2. Baseline Characteristics\nDemographic characteristics such as patient age, gender, weight, ethnicity, prior cancer \ntherapy, medical history and ECOG performance status will be tabulated.\n9.3.3.

Electrocardiogram Data \nAll ECGs obtained during the study will be evaluated for safety.  The triplicate data will be \naveraged.  All summary statistics and data presentations will use the triplicate averaged data.  \nAny data obtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time points will \nnot be averaged along with the preceding triplicates. QT measurements corrected by heart \nrate (QTc) using Bazett\u2019s (QTcB) and Fridericia\u2019s (QTcF) methods will be used for data \nsummaries and interpretation.\n9.3.6. Concomitant Medications\nAll medications received during the treatment period will be considered as concomitant \nmedications and will be coded by WHO medical dictionary.  Patients who received \nconcomitant medications will be listed. Follow-up systemic therapy for the primary \ndiagnosis will be summarized by categories of follow-up therapy and will be listed for each \npatient as appropriate.\n9.3.7. Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Endpoints\nConcentration data of crizotinib will be listed by patient and by actual collection time and \nday.\nConcentration-QTc modeling analysis will be conducted using the ECG data from this study \nand/or combined data with other clinical studies of crizotinib.  A separate study specific QT \ncorrection factor will be estimated for the QT-RR measurements in each clinical study of \ncrizotinib.  Linear, log-linear, and/or saturable models will be examined for the \nconcentration-QTc relationship. Exploratory analyses (via graphical displays and/or model \nfitting) include accounting for a delayed effect and the justification for the choice of \npharmacodynamic model. Diagnostic evaluation will be included to explore the adequacy of \nthe model.\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of samples collected in this study will be performed in \naccordance with the FDA guidance on Population Pharmacokinetics (February 1999).  All \npatients treated with crizotinib and for whom drug plasma concentration results (from at least \n1 visit) are available will be included in the population analysis.  The plasma concentration \ndata set from this study will be pooled with data sets from additional crizotinib studies.  \nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis will involve mixed effects modeling performed using \nappropriate software (eg, NONMEM). The data from the analysis will describe the PK \nfollowing multiple dose administration of crizotinib and describe covariates that are \nimportant determinants of crizotinib disposition.\nIn addition, population PK/PD analysis will be explored, as necessary, based on emerging \nsafety/clinical response data.\nThe results of these modeling analyses may be reported separately from the clinical study \nreport.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 58\n9.3.8. Analysis of Molecular Profiling Endpoints\nThe types of ALK fusion/translocation, mutations, amplification and overexpression will be \ntabulated by tumor type.  Summaries of baseline molecular profiling results will be provided.  \nChanges will be summarized for those patients with both pre and post treatment and end of \ntreatment/withdrawal molecular profiling results.  \n9.4. Interim Analysis \nNo interim analysis is planned.\n9.5. Data Monitoring Committee\nAn external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study.  For the \npurpose of this protocol, Sponsor procedures for periodic safety review will be applied to \nreview individual and summary data collected in the safety and clinical databases.  \nProcedures include:\n\uf0b7\nSurveillance for serious adverse events (SAEs) according to regulatory guidelines.\n\uf0b7\nRoutine monitoring of non-serious adverse events as they are recorded in the CRFs.\n\uf0b7\nPeriodic teleconferences with the principal investigators on individual studies to share \nexperiences and ensure communication.\nFindings of the periodic safety reviews, according to Sponsor procedures will be documented \nin the project files and action taken as appropriate.  Findings having immediate implication\nfor the management of patients on study will be communicated to all principal investigators \nin the timeframe associated with unexpected and drug-related SAEs.\nIn addition, an internal review committee including at least a medical oncologist and \nstatistician will provide periodic review of safety data.\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nDuring study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure \nthat the protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents \nto confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The investigator and institution will \nallow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct \naccess to source documents to perform this verification.\nThe study site may be subject to review by the institutional review board (IRB)/ethics \ncommittee (EC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies \nworking with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory \nauthorities.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 59\nIt is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the \nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the \nprocess.\n11.

Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record\nAs used in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to \neither a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection \nmethod used in this study.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed \noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to \nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory \nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nThe investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, \nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source \ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, \nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The \nCRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the \ndata contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source \ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the \noriginal entry.\u201d\nIn most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the physician's patient chart.  In \nthese cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. \nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these \ncases, a document should be available at the investigator\u2019s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly \nidentify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the \nsource document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator \nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient \ninformation to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed \nconsent/assent documents, copies of all CRFs, serious adverse event forms, source \ndocuments, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of \nrelevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records \nshould be retained by the investigator according to International Conference on \nHarmonisation (ICH), according to local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study \nAgreement, whichever is longer.\nIf the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the \nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified.  The \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 60\nstudy records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another \ninvestigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. The \ninvestigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, even if \nretention requirements have been met.\n12. ETHICS\n12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)\nIt is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, \nprotocol amendments, informed consent/assent documents, and other relevant documents, \neg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC.  All correspondence with the \nIRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be \nforwarded to Pfizer.\nThe only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is \nwhere the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In \nthat event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after \nthe implementation.\n12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as \nthe general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical \nResearch Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical \nSciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on \nHarmonization 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2008). \nIn addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International \nConference on Harmonization guideline on Good Clinical Practice, and applicable local \nregulatory requirements and laws.\n12.3. Patient Information and Consent\nAll parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names \nor other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where \nrequired by law.  \nWhen study data is compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, patient \nnames, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical code consisting \nof a numbering system provided by Pfizer in order to de-identify the study patient. The study \nsite will maintain a confidential list of patients who participated in the study linking their \nnumerical code to the patient\u2019s actual identity. In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain \nhigh standards of confidentiality and protection of patient personal data consistent with \napplicable privacy laws.\nThe informed consent/assent documents must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local \nregulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 61\nThe informed consent/assent documents used during the informed consent process must be \nreviewed by the Sponsor, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection.\nThe investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his/her legally acceptable \nrepresentative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible \nrisks associated with participation.  \nWhenever consent is obtained from a patient\u2019s legally acceptable representative or legal \nguardian, the patient\u2019s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when \nthe patient has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC.  If the \ninvestigator determines that a patient\u2019s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot \nreasonably be consulted then, as permitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local \nregulatory and legal requirements, the patient\u2019s assent may be waived with source \ndocumentation of the reason assent was not obtained.  If the study patient does not provide \nhis/her own consent, the source documents must record why the patient did not provide \nconsent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the \nperson signing the consent was the patient\u2019s legally acceptable representative, the consent \nsigner\u2019s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent, spouse) and that the patient\u2019s assent was \nobtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally, it must be documented in the source \ndocuments.\nIf the study includes minor subjects who reach the age of majority during the study, as \nrecognized under local law, they must re-consent as adults to remain in the study.  If the \nenrollment of \u2018emancipated minors\u2019 is permitted by the study age criteria, the IRB/EC, and \nlocal law, they must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the\npermission of a parent or legal guardian.\nThe investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed \nconsent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative parent(s), or legal \nguardian and the patient\u2019s assent, when applicable, before any study-specific activity is \nperformed, unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by an IRB/EC.  The \ninvestigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent/assent document.\n12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable \nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any new \ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the \ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.  \nIn addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures \ntaken by the investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of \nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 62\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\n13.1. End of Trial in a Member State\nEnd of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is \ndeemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the \nregulatory application (ie, Clinical Trial Application [CTA]) and ethics application in the \nMember State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by \na Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal \nconclusion to the study in that Member State.\n13.2. End of Trial in All Other Participating Countries\nEnd of Trial in all other participating countries is defined as the time at which it is deemed \nthat sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the regulatory \napplication (ie, Clinical Trial Application [CTA]).\n14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, \nchange in opinion of the IRB/EC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer.  In \naddition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of crizotinib at any time.\nIf a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the \ninvestigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and \nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a timed period deemed appropriate by each \ninstitutional IRB/IEC.  As directed by Pfizer, all study materials must be collected and all \nCRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS\n15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer\nPfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the \nresults of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials \nDatabase (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with \napplicable local laws/regulations).\nIn all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and \ncomplete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in \nwhich the study was conducted.\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\nPfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer-sponsored \ninterventional studies conducted in patients that evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer \nproduct, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted.  US Basic \nResults are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date for studies in \nadult populations or within 6 months of the primary completion date for studies in pediatric \npopulations.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 63\nPrimary Completion Date is defined as the date that the final patient was examined or \nreceived an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, \nwhether the clinical study concluded according to the pre-specified protocol or was \nterminated.\nEudraCT\nPfizer posts EU Basic Results on EudraCT for all Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies that \nare in scope of EU requirements.  EU Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year \nof the primary completion date for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the \nprimary completion date for studies in pediatric populations.\nwww.pfizer.com\nPublic Disclosure Synopses (clinical study report synopses in which any data that could be \nused to identify individual patients has been removed) on www.pfizer.com for \nPfizer-sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is \nposted to www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n15.2. Publications by Investigators\nPfizer has no objection to publication by Investigator of any information collected or \ngenerated by Investigator, whether or not the results are favorable to the Investigational \nDrug. However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of Confidential Information or \nunprotected Inventions, Investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any \nproposed publication or other type of disclosure before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed.\nInvestigator will provide manuscripts, abstracts, or the full text of any other intended \ndisclosure (poster presentation, invited speaker or guest lecturer presentation, etc.) to Pfizer \nat least 30 days before they are submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If any \npatent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, Investigator agrees to delay \nthe disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days.\nInvestigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed Confidential Information \n(other than the Study results themselves) before disclosure.\nIf the Study is part of a multi-centre study, Investigator agrees that the first publication is to \nbe a joint publication covering all centers. However, if a joint manuscript has not been \nsubmitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the Study at all \nparticipating sites, Investigator is free to publish separately, subject to the other requirements \nof this Section.\nFor all publications relating to the Study, Institution will comply with recognized ethical \nstandards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II - \u201cEthical \nConsiderations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research\u201d of the Uniform Requirements for \nManuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, \nestablished by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 64\nPublication of study results is also provided for in the Clinical Study Agreement between \nPfizer and the institution.

RECIST Version 1.1 Tumor Assessment Criteria\nAt baseline, individual tumor lesions will be categorized by the investigator as either \nmeasurable or not, according to the criteria summarized below 11:\nMeasurable Lesions\nLesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the \nplane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: \n\uf0b7\n10 mm for lesions other than lymph nodes and assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice \nthickness no greater than 5 mm).\n\uf0b7\n10 mm for lesions assessed clinically by caliper measurement (lesions which cannot \nbe accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable).\n\uf0b7\n20 mm for lesions assessed by chest X-ray.\n\uf0b7\n15 mm in short axis for lymph nodes when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice \nthickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).\nNon-Measurable Lesions\nNon-measurable lesions include small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological \nlymph nodes with a \uf0b310 but <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  \nTruly non-measurable lesions include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial \neffusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal \nmasses identified by physical exam and not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.\nNodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be \nrecorded or followed. \nSpecial Considerations Regarding Specific Lesions \nBone Lesions:\n\uf0b7\nBone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques \nto measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the \npresence or disappearance of bone lesions.\n\uf0b7\nLytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue \ncomponents, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT \nor MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets \nthe definition of measurability described above.\n\uf0b7\nBlastic bone lesions are non-measurable. \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 69\nCystic Lesions:\n\uf0b7\nLesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be \nconsidered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they \nare, by definition, simple cysts.\n\uf0b7\n\u2018Cystic lesions\u2019 thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as \nmeasurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. \nHowever, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for \nselection as target lesions.\nLesions with Prior Local Treatment:\n\uf0b7\nTumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other \nloco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been \ndemonstrated progression in the lesion.\nSolitary Lesions:\nIf a measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be \nconfirmed by cytology/histology. \nRecording Tumor Measurements\nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and up to 5 in total and\nrepresentative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and \nrecorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment. Target lesions should be \nselected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameters) and their suitability for \naccurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). \nThe longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion. The sum of the longest \ndiameter of all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum diameter to \nbe used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable \ndimension of the disease during treatment. \nOne exception to the above described approach is related to pathological lymph nodes.  \nPathological lymph nodes are defined as measurable lesions and may be identified as target \nlesions if the criterion of a short axis of \uf0b315 mm by CT scan is met.  Only the short axis of \nthese nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  Nodal size is normally reported as two \ndimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the \naxial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller \nof these measures is the short axis. \nA sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all \ntarget lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The baseline \nsum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor \nregression in the measurable dimension of the disease.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should \nalso be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be \nfollowed as \u2018present\u2019, \u2018absent\u2019, or in rare cases \u2018unequivocal progression\u2019. In addition, it is \npossible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on \nthe case record form (eg, \u2018multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes\u2019 or \u2018multiple liver \nmetastases\u2019).\nDefinition of Tumor Response \nTarget Lesions\nResponse in target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. \n\uf0b7\nPartial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum \nif that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum \nmust also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one \nor more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression.\n\uf0b7\nStable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient \nincrease to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on \nstudy.\nWhen nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to \n\u2018normal\u2019 size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This \nmeasurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate \nprogression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means \nthat patients with CR may not have a total sum of \u2018zero\u2019 on the CRF.\nNon-Target Lesions\nWhile some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and \ninstead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. \nResponse in non-target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization \nof tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm \nshort axis).\n\uf0b7\nNon-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or \nmaintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 71\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.\n(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).\nCytology, Histology \nThese techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by \nprotocol (for example, residual lesions in germ cell tumors). When effusions are known to \nbe a potential adverse effect of treatment (eg, taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), \nthe cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens \nduring treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or \nstable disease in order to differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive \ndisease.\nFor patients having effusions or ascites, only cases having cytological proof of malignancy \nshould be recorded on the CRF. Effusions that have not been evaluated using cytology or \nwere found to be non-malignant should not be recorded on the CRF. \nNew Lesions \nThe appearance of new malignant lesions indicates PD. New lesion should be unequivocal\n(eg, not attributable to differences in imaging technique, or change in imaging modality or \nfindings not attributable to tumor). If a new lesion is equivocal, for example due to its small \nsize, continued therapy and follow-up assessment will clarify the etiology of the disease. If \nrepeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared \nusing the date of the initial scan. \nThe use of FDG-PET is sometimes reasonable to complement a CT scan assessment of a PD \n(particularly for possible \u2018new\u2019 disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can \nbe identified according to the following algorithm: \n\uf0b7\nNegative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up.\n\uf0b7\nNo FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow- up: if the positive \nFDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is \nPD.\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, \nadditional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring \nat that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that \nis not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.\n",

If the minimum time is not met \nwhen SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient\u2019s best response depends on the \nsubsequent assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD at \nsecond and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD. The \nsame patient lost to follow-up after the first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable. \nWhen confirmation of CR and PR is required (ie, non-randomized trials with primary \nendpoint of response), the best overall response is defined according to the tumor response \nalong the study.  Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each \nare met at a following time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).\nPatients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment \nwithout objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as\n\u2018symptomatic deterioration\u2019. Every effort should be made to document objective progression \neven after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an \nobjective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of \nsuch patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target lesions.\nIn some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. \nWhen the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the \nresidual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before assigning a status of \ncomplete response. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner \nsimilar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent \nfibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively \ndescribed in the protocol and supported by disease specific medical literature for the \nindication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false \npositive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 74\nAppendix 4. NCI International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nA. Introduction\nResponse criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) are based on the 1999 NCI \nInternational Workshop to standardize response criteria for NHL and recent updates to these \ncriteria reported in 2007.  These updates incorporate additional technologies and \nassessments, which have become more widely available and have demonstrated predictive \nvalue.  The updates also eliminate a commonly misinterpreted response category.  Response \ncriteria are based on assessments of tumor measurements and clinical findings.\nB. Required Assessments\nThe following assessments are required at screening/baseline and at each subsequent time \npoint required in the protocol:\n1. Objective tumor measurements.\n2. Clinical assessment including ECOG score, \u201cB-symptoms,\u201d (eg, fever, night sweats, \nweight loss) and liver and spleen size.\n3. Bone marrow biopsies (or aspirates if biopsies were not obtainable), preferably \nbilateral, optimally of at least 20 mm in aggregate.  Note:  A bone marrow biopsy \nmust be performed only to confirm a complete response (CR) if initially positive, or if \nclinically indicated by new abnormalities in the peripheral blood counts or blood \nsmear.\n4. Biochemical markers if definitely assignable to NHL (eg, lactate dehydrogenase).\nC. Methods of Measurement\n1. Computed tomography (CT) will be used to measure index lesions selected for \nresponse assessment; MRIs may be used if CT scans are not available or if the patient\ncannot tolerate CT scans (eg, are intolerant of CT contrast media).  Positron emission \ntomography (PET) using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), when available, should \nalso be considered together with CT results.  Conventional CT and MRI should be \nperformed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT \nshould be performed by using an 8-mm or less contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  \nCT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are required for each assessment.\nNote:  A CT scan of the neck should be obtained if cervical disease is present.\n2. Lesions on standard radiographs are not acceptable as measurable lesions.\n3. All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or \ncalipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 75\nbeginning of the investigational product treatment and never more than 4 weeks \nbefore the beginning of treatment.\n4. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to \ncharacterize each identified and reported lesion at screening/baseline and during the \nstudy.\n5. Lesions noted on physical examination, such as skin nodules and lymph nodes, will \nbe considered measurable only if they are superficial and are \uf0b310 mm at initial \nassessment.  As often as possible, the same investigator using the same method of \nmeasurement should assess these lesions at all visits.\nD. Baseline Documentation of \u201cIndex\u201d and \u201cNonIndex\u201d Lesions\n1. Up to a maximum of 6 of the largest dominant lesions should be identified and \nrecorded as Index lesions and measured at baseline.  These nodes or masses should \nbe selected according to the following features:\n\uf0b7\nThey should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions;\n\uf0b7\nThey should be from as disparate regions of the body as possible;\n\uf0b7\nThey should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever \nthese sites are involved; and\n\uf0b7\nThey should be suitable for accurate repeated measurements (eg, relationship to \nidentifiable landmarks).\n2. The product of the longest transverse diameter and the longest perpendicular \ntransverse diameter will be recorded for all Index lesions.  The sum of the product \ndiameters (SPD) for all Index lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline \nSPD.  The baseline individual product diameters and the baseline SPD will be used as \nthe references by which the objective tumor response will be characterized.\n3. All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as NonIndex lesions and \nmust also be recorded at baseline.  Both nodal and non-nodal (eg, masses present in \nthe liver and/or spleen) are recorded.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, \nbut the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout the study.\nE. Response Criteria\n1. Complete Response (CR) requires the following:\na.\nComplete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of \ndisease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before \ntherapy.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 76\nb. All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed on CT to normal size \n(\uf0a31.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes >1.5 cm before therapy).  \nPreviously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and more \nthan 1.0 cm in their short axis before treatment must have decreased to \uf0a31 cm in \ntheir in their short axis after treatment.  NOTE for PET scans: for patients with no \npretreatment PET scan or when a PET scan was positive before treatment, a \npost-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.\nc.\nThe spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT scan, \nmust have regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical examination.  \nAny macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should \nno longer be present.  Other organs considered to be enlarged before therapy as a \nresult of involvement by lymphoma such as liver and kidneys, must have \ndecreased in size.\nd. If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate \nmust be cleared on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy of the same site.  The \nsample on which this determination is made must be adequate (\uf0b320 mm biopsy \ncore).  If a sample is indeterminate by morphology, it should be negative by \nimmunohistochemistry.  A sample that is negative by immunohistochemistry but \nthat demonstrates a small population of clonal lymphocytes by flow cytometry \nwill be considered a CR until data become available demonstrating a clear \ndifference in patient outcome.\n2. Partial Response (PR) requires the following:\na.\n\uf0b350% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.\nb. No increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.\nc.\nSplenic and hepatic nodules must regress by \uf0b350% in the SPD, or for single \nnodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.\nd. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other \norgans is usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present.\ne.\nBone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR because it is \nassessable and not measurable disease; however, if positive, the cell type \nshould be specified in the report (eg, large-cell lymphoma, or low-grade \nlymphoma such as small, lymphocytic small cleaved, or mixed small and \nlarge cells).  Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria, but who have \npersistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial \nresponders.  When the bone marrow was involved before treatment and a \nclinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after \ntreatment, patients should be considered partial responders.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 77\nf.\nNo new sites of disease.\ng. NOTES for PET: For patients with follicular, diffuse large B-cell, or \nmantle-cell lymphomas (ie, typically FDG-avid lymphomas) and with no \npretreatment PET scan or with a positive pretreatment PET scan, the \npost-treatment PET should be positive in at least one previously involved site.  \nFor patients with other NHLs (ie, variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity \nunknown) and without a pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan \nwas negative, CT criteria should be used.  In patients with follicular or \nmantle-cell lymphomas, a PET scan is only indicated with one or at most two \nresidual masses that have regressed by more than 50% on CT; those with \nmore than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be \nconsidered partial responders.\n3. Stable disease (SD) is defined as less than a PR (see above) but is NOT progressive \ndisease (see below, progressive disease).\na. NOTES for PET: For patients with follicular, diffuse large B-cell, or \nmantle-cell lymphomas (ie, typically FDG-avid lymphomas), the PET should \nbe positive at prior sites of disease with no new areas of involvement on the \npost-treatment CT or PET.  For patients with other NHLs (ie, variably \nFDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown) and without a pretreatment \nPET scan or with a negative pretreatment PET, there must be no change in \nthe size of the previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan.\n4. Relapsed disease (after CR)/ Progressive disease (after PR or SD) requires the \nfollowing:\na.\nNOTE: Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more \nthan 1.5 cm regardless of the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of \n1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is more \nthan 1.0 cm.  Lymph nodes \uf0a31.0 \uf0b4\uf0a31.0 cm will not be considered as \nabnormal for relapse or progressive disease.\nb. Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the \nend of treatment, even if other lesions are decreasing in size.  NOTE for PET: \nIncreased FDG uptake in a previously unaffected site should only be \nconsidered relapsed or progressive disease after confirmation with other \nmodalities.\nc.\nAt least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved \nnodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or \nhepatic nodules).  To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a \ndiameter of the short axis of less than 1.0 cm must increase by \uf0b350% and to a \nsize of 1.5 \uf0b41.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 78\nd. At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously \nidentified node more than 1 cm in its short axis.\ne.\nNOTE for PET: Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical \nFDG-avid lymphoma (ie, follicular, diffuse large B-cell, or mantle-cell \nlymphomas) or the lesion was PET positive before treatment unless the lesion \nis too small to be detected with current PET systems (<1.5 cm in its long axis \nby CT).\nf.\nNOTE: Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar \nto that for nodal disease.  For these recommendations, the spleen is considered \nnodal disease.  Disease that is only assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone \nlesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, while an \nabnormality is still noted by imaging studies or physical examination, it is \nfound to be histologically negative.\nEvaluation of Non-Index Lesions: Although a clear progression of \"Non Index\" \nlesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating \nphysician should prevail and the progression status should be confirmed later by \nthe review panel.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 79\nResponse Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nResponse Category\nDefinition\nNodal Masses\nSpleen, Liver\nBone Marrow\nCR\nDisappearance \nof all evidence \nof disease\nRegression to \nnormal size on \nCTa\nNot palpable, \nnodules \ndisappeared\ninfiltrate \ncleared on \nrepeat biopsyb\nPR\nRegression of \nmeasurable \ndisease and no \nnew sites\n\uf0b350% decrease \nin SPD of \uf0a36 \nlargest dominant \nmasses; no \nincrease in size \nof other nodesc\n\uf0b350% decrease \nin SPD of \nnodules;d no \nincrease in size \nof liver or \nspleen\nIrrelevant if \npositive \npretreatment; \ncell type \nshould be \nspecified\nSD\nFailure to attain \nCR, PR or \nprogressive \ndisease\nOn CT: no new \nsites; no change \nin size of \nprevious \nlesionse\nRelapsed or\nProgressive \nDisease\nNew lesion or \nincrease by \n\uf0b350% of \npreviously \ninvolved sites \nfrom nadir\nNew lesion(s) \n>1.5 cm (any \naxis); \uf0b350% \nincrease in SPD \nof >1 node; or \n\uf0b350% increase \nin longest \ndiameter of \npreviously \nidentified node \n>1 cm in short \naxisf\n>50% increase \nfrom nadir in \nthe SPD of any \nprevious\nlesions\nNew or \nrecurrent \ninvolvement\nReference: Cheson DB, Pfistner B, Juweid ME, Gascoyne RD, Specht L, Horning SJ, et al.

Response Evaluation\n1. Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of \ntreatment without objective evidence of progressive disease at that time should be \nclassified as having \"symptomatic deterioration.\"  Every effort should be made to \ndocument the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.\n2. Evaluation of Best Overall Response: The best overall response is the best response \nrecorded from the start of the treatment until progressive disease/recurrence (taking as \nreference for progressive disease, the smallest measurements recorded since the \ntreatment started).\n3. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be \nconfirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed \uf0b34 weeks after the criteria \nfor response are first met.\nG. Duration of Response\n1. Overall Response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time \nmeasurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until \nthe first date that recurrence or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking \nas reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the \ntreatment started.\n2. Stable Disease: SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for \nprogressive disease are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded \nsince the treatment started.  The minimal time interval for duration of SD is 4 weeks.\n3. Time to Progression: Time to progression is the interval from the start of the \ntreatment until the first date that recurrence or progression, or death secondary to \nprogression is documented, censored at the last evaluation.\n",

All cycles are \n3 weeks in duration. Sufficient study medication for a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment will be dispensed at each \nclinic visit.  During the non-clinical visit cycles, the Investigator is responsible for ensuring the patient contacts the \nclinical site in order to provide an update of adverse events and concomitant medications. \n2.\nEnd of Treatment/Withdrawal: Obtain blood pressure, pulse rate, hematology and LFTs, and physical examination if \nnot completed during the previous 4 weeks on study.\n3.\nPhysical Examination: Includes an examination of major body systems and weight.\n4.\nOphthalmologic Examination: Includes visual acuity, slit lamp, and fundoscopy, and should be performed by an \nophthalmologist.  The ophthalmologic examination should be repeated during the study when visual disturbances have \nbeen observed and when there is an increase in the grade for visual disturbances.  \n5.\nHematology, Liver function tests and Urinalysis: Required tests are listed in Table 7. \nWhere possible, laboratory tests should be performed preferably at the clinical site\u2019s local laboratory, and, when not \npossible, patients will provide the laboratory test results copy (from the non-clinical site laboratory), eg, by telephone,\nand bring a copy of the laboratory test results at the visit; process depends on local medical practice.  The copy of the \nlaboratory test results must be retained in the patient\u2019s file at the clinical site for documentation purposes.  If ALT or \nAST \uf0b3Grade 3 or ALT or AST \uf0b3Grade 2 and total bilirubin \uf0b3Grade 2, obtain repeat ALT or AST and total bilirubin \nwithin 48 hours and then repeat every 48-72 hours until ALT/AST Grade \uf0a31.\n6.\nReflex Microscopy required if urine dipstick is positive for blood or protein.\n7.\nSerum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test, with sensitivity of \nat least 25 mIU/mL, will be routinely performed at every cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study\ntreatment, and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise \nsuspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by institutional review board/ethics \ncommittee (IRB/ECs) or if required by local regulations.\n8.\nContraceptive Check: Male patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing \npotential will need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of at least 2 of the selected methods of \ncontraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the need to use 2 highly effective \ncontraception methods consistently and correctly and document such conversation in the patient\u2019s chart.  In addition, \nthe investigator or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately if aone or both selected \ncontraception methods is are discontinued, or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the patient\u2019s partner.  \n9.\nTumor Assessments: Will be repeated at the frequency as per local clinical practice, and will no longer be recorded on \nthe CRF. However, tumor assessment information should be retained in the patient\u2019s file for documentation purposes.\n10. Adverse Events: For serious adverse events, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative \nbegins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient\u2019s participation \nin the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and \nincluding 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product.  Adverse events (serious and \nnon-serious) should be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) from the time the patient has taken at least one dose \nof investigational product through the patient\u2019s last visit.\n11. Concomitant Medications/Treatments: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded up to 28 days post \nthe last dose of study treatment.  \n12. Tumor Tissue for Molecular Profiling:  Sample will be sent to central laboratory (see Section 7.5).  An optional fresh \ntumor sample will be collected at the end of treatment if a patient discontinues due to disease progression.\n",

This trial includes a dose escalation component followed by a dose expansion component in a selected cohort of molecularly-defined patients referred to as the enriched population.  During the dose escalation phase, crizotinib was administered under fasting conditions QD or BID on a continuous schedule.  The objectives of the dose escalation component of the trial were to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), and PK of crizotinib in patients with advanced cancer.  Enrollment for the dose escalation part of the trial is complete and 37 patients have been dosed.  Three DLTs were observed including Grade 3 ALT increase in 1 patient at200 mg QD and Grade 3 fatigue in 2 patients at 300 mg BID.  The MTD was determined to be 250 mg BID administered in a continuous daily dosing regimen.  The most common treatment-related adverse events seen to date were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and visual disturbance, which were primarily Grade 1-2 in severity. Nausea and vomiting were independent of dose or duration of treatment and were managed effectively using I.V. or oral anti-emetics. Treatment-related visual disturbances which consisted mainly of seeing shadows or streaks during changes in light were observed and occurred at doses of 200 mg BID or above.  All of these visual events were Grade 1 in severity.  In some patients, these events resolved with continued treatment but are reversible upon discontinuation of crizotinib.Crizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 20\nIn a recent review of safety for crizotinib (PF-02341066) Pfizer has determined that there are \n4 potential cases of pneumonitis which may be related to crizotinib (PF-02341066). One \nsuch case was a radiation recall pneumonitis. Based on the other 3 cases that were not linked \nto radiation treatment and relative to all enrolled adult patients (N=273) who have been \ntreated with crizotinib (PF-02341066), as of July 16 2010, the current frequency of \nnon-radiation recall pneumonitis is 1.1%.  One of the 4 cases was fatal. The 3 other patients \nrecovered from the event. One patient experienced radiation recall pneumonitis, was \nappropriately treated and was able to restart crizotinib (PF-02341066). The other 2 patients \nwere permanently discontinued from crizotinib (PF-02341066). Interpretation of the \n3 non-radiation recall cases was complicated by the underlying non-small cell lung cancer for \nwhich the patients were being treated. In addition these 3 cases were complicated by the \nco-administration of other drugs known to potentially cause pneumonitis and/or other \npulmonary complications. One of the cases was considered not related to crizotinib \n(PF-02341066) by the investigator. Based on this new safety information suspected cases of \npneumonitis will be evaluated and patients with pre-existing interstitial fibrosis or interstitial \nlung disease will be excluded from the entering the study\nThe crizotinib adverse drug reaction (ADR) list was updated in the crizotinib Investigator\u2019s\nBrochure (IB) to include the development of complex renal cysts. The development of \ncomplex renal cysts has been reported in some patients with NSCLC treated with crizotinib. \nThese cysts may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and have developed from several weeks to \nseveral months after starting crizotinib. The precise nature and significance of these cysts is \nunclear; however, while no evidence of malignancy has been found based on aspiration of cyst \nfluid and biopsy in the reported cases, complex renal cysts may be associated with renal \nmalignancy, and thus consultation with a urologist or suitable alternate medical expert is \nrecommended. Neither renal impairment nor clinically relevant proteinuria has been observed in \nany of the cases.\nAdditionally, the IB has updated the Effects on the Liver Section 7.6.4. With more than \n1400 patients who have been treated with crizotinib in clinical trials, 2 new Hy's Law cases \nand 2 cases of fatal hepatic failure have recently (March 2012) been reported as serious \nadverse events related to crizotinib treatment (a fifth Hy\u2019s Law case had previously been \nreported in an earlier version of the IB).  Of all 5 of these cases, 2 patients presented with \nanorexia, 2 patients presented with weakness and fatigue, and 1 patient presented with \nabdominal pain. Four of these 5 cases, including the 2 fatal cases, were observed within the \nfirst 2 months after the start of crizotinib treatment, while significant transaminase elevation \nwas observed after 6 months of crizotinib treatment in the fifth case.  PK data are available \nfor the first 80 patients enrolled in the ongoing Phase 1 trial. After oral administration of \ncrizotinib single doses in the fasted state, peak plasma concentrations were reached at about \n4 hours and followed by a multi-exponential decline with an average terminal half-life of 43\nto 51 hours across doses.  Following multiple oral dosing for 15 days or longer, crizotinib\nAUCtau increased with median accumulation ratios ranging 1.7-3.4 after QD dosing and \n4.0-5.9 after BID dosing, respectively. The repeated administration at 250 mg BID for \n15 days or longer produced a median trough plasma concentration of 256 ng/mL (53 nM, free \ndrug), exceeding the target efficacious levels (Ceff) predicted for inhibition of cMet and ALK\nbased on preclinical mouse tumor models. Non-linearity of pharmacokinetics was observed \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)A8081013Final Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 21at 50 and 100 mg QD doses as the AUCtau and Cmax increased more than proportionally with the dose.  However, patients receiving doses ranging from 100 mg QD to 300 mg BID generally demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics, as evidenced by proportional increases in mean AUCtau and Cmax after single or multiple doses.Crizotinib showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A isozymes in human liver microsomes with a kinact of 0.11 min-1 and Ki of 3.0 \uf06dM.  In order to assess the effect of crizotinib on CYP3A activity in the GI tract and the liver, the PK of midazolam (a CYP3A substrate probe) following a single oral 2 mg dose was evaluated before (Day -7) and after (Cycle 2 Day 1) repeated administration of crizotinib at 250 mg BID in 13 patients.  A 3.6-fold (90% CI: 2.7-4.9) increase in the oral midazolam AUC was observed following 28 days of crizotinib dosing at 250 mg BID, suggesting that crizotinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A.Results from a pilot food effect study suggested that co-administration with a standard high-fat meal did not to change the geometric mean of AUC24 and Cmax of crizotinibfollowing single 250-mg crizotinib doses in cancer patients. Crizotinib (PF-02341066) has shown compelling clinical activity in patients with NSCLC with EML4-ALK fusions events enrolled in the expanded cohort of a Phase 1 trial. In 50 evaluable patients, an ORR of 64% and clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 90% was reported by E.L. Kwak at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December of 2009. To date, based on the Phase 1 study (A8081001), there is a limited patient experience in patients with tumors other than NSCLC with changes in their molecular genetic profile involving the ALK gene locus. One patient with IMT achieved a PR which has been ongoing for 1.5 years (1PR of 2 IMT patients enrolled) and one patient with adult neuroblastoma harboring an ALKmutation achieved stable disease (SD) lasting in excess of 6 months (1 SD of1 neuroblastoma patient enrolled). One patient with ALCL associated with ALKtranslocation has been studied to date but failed to achieve a clinical response. In addition, in an ongoing pediatric study there has been preliminary evidence of activity in a patient with IMT based on communication with the study principal investigator.  Complete information on crizotinib (PF-02341066) may be found in the single reference safety document (SRSD), which for this study is the investigator\u2019s brochure (IB).",

The sample size may be adjusted based on the number of patients identified and safety or evidence of antitumor efficacy within patient groups. In addition, the eligibility criteria may be modified to exclude patients based on the lack of efficacy demonstrated in specific patient groups.Only ALK genetic event positive patients, as determined by the investigative site, may enter the study. ALK translocation/fusion, amplification, mutation and overexpression can be assessed by using any of the available technologies including fluorescence in-situ hybridication (FISH), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), array Comparative Genomic Hybridication (aCGH) or direct sequencing. The methodology of ALK testing required will depend entirely on the malignancy in question and the existence of Crizotinib (PF-02341066)A8081013Final Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 23published data supporting a given methodology of ALK testing.  For example, ALCL is the only disease for which IHC alone is acceptable to document ALK positivity, as IHC has been shown to correlate with ALK-fusion events in ALCL and is widely accepted as a means of documenting ALK positivity in ALCL.  For diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, IHC alone is not sufficient for enrollment; an ALK gene fusion event must be documented by FISH or PCR.  For neuroblastoma, ALK gene amplification must be documented by either FISH or aCGH, or a known ALK activating point mutation must be documented by PCR or direct sequencing; IHC alone is not acceptable.  For inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), IHC alone is not sufficient, unless the intercalated antibody-enhanced polymer (iAEP) method is used.12  FISH or PCR demonstrating a fusion event is acceptable for IMT.  Other diseases will be considered for enrollment if publications exist supporting ALK mutation/fusion/amplification as an oncogenic driver for the disease in question.Patients may continue treatment with crizotinib on this trial as long as there is evidence of clinical benefit in the judgment of the investigator.

The topical use of these medications (if applicable), such as 2% ketoconazole cream, may be allowed.  The concurrent use of potent CYP3A inducers,including but not limited to carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, and St. John\u2019s wort, are not allowed in the study.In vitro data indicate that the most pronounced inhibitory potential of crizotinib was observed toward CYP3A4 (testosterone)-mediated drug metabolism.  Crizotinib has minimal potential to inhibit other human CYP isoforms such as CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6.  Crizotinib also showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A isozymes in human liver microsomes.  In cancer patients, a mean 3.6-fold (90% CI: 2.7-4.9) increase in the oral midazolam AUC was observed following 28 days of crizotinib dosing at 250 mg BID, suggesting that crizotinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A.  Caution must be exercised in patients receiving crizotinib in combination with drugs that are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A, such as alfentanil, cyclosporine, fentanyl, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus.  In particular, co-administration of crizotinib with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices including, but not limited to, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, pimozide, astemizole*, cisapride*, and terfenadine* (* withdrawn from U.S. market) must be avoided from the time of the first dose of crizotinib until treatment discontinuation.Additionally, the concurrent use of non-prescription drugs, complimentary medicines(excluding vitamins) or herbal supplements is not recommended.

After Cycle 10 tumor assessments will be performed every 12 weeks, and will be reduced to every 24 weeks from Cycle \uf0b326 and to every52 weeks from Cycle \uf0b352.  CT or MRI scan should also be performed whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration).  The determination of anti-tumor activity will be based on objective tumor assessments made according to the RECIST version 1.1 or NCI International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma (2007)(Appendix 3 and Appendix 4).  The CT scans used for tumor assessments should be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons. The same imaging modality should be used throughout the study to measure disease.  Tumor evaluation by positron emission tomography (PET) scan or by ultrasound may not substitute for CT or MRI scans.  CT or MRI scans will include chest, abdomen and pelvis at screening (and neck for patients with NHL).  Subsequent staging scans may include only known sites of disease, unless scanning of additional sites is clinically indicated. CT/MRI head is required at screening. Brain must be included in subsequent tumor assessments if a patient has brain metastases, otherwise brain will only be evaluated when clinically indicated. Bone scans are required if bone metastases are suspected.  A bone scan is also required at the time of confirmation of response for patients who have bone metastases.  Scans will be collected for a potential independent radiology review.  PET scanning should be used to evaluate for complete response in those NHL patients whose CT/MRI scans suggest only a partial response.  Once a normal PET scan (ie, a PET scan suggesting complete response) has been obtained in a patient with NHL, repeat PET scanning is not required unless there is clinical evidence to suggest disease progression.  Bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate should also be performed to document complete response for any NHL patients known to have bone marrow involvement at baseline or for any NHL patient whose marrow status was unknown at baseline.  When new effusions or ascites are present and represent the only potential site of disease progression, cytologic analysis should be performed and the results, malignant or non-malignant, should be recorded on the CRF.Measurable lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered target lesions unless increase in size has been observed following completion of radiation therapy.After IRB/EC approval of Amendment #5, tumor assessments will be performed as per local clinical practice (see Table 6, Appendix 5), and will no longer be recorded on the CRF.

Target lesions should be \nselected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameters) and their suitability for \naccurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). \nThe longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion. The sum of the longest \ndiameter of all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum diameter to \nbe used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable \ndimension of the disease during treatment. \nOne exception to the above described approach is related to pathological lymph nodes.  \nPathological lymph nodes are defined as measurable lesions and may be identified as target \nlesions if the criterion of a short axis of \uf0b315 mm by CT scan is met.  Only the short axis of \nthese nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  Nodal size is normally reported as two \ndimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the \naxial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller \nof these measures is the short axis. \nA sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all \ntarget lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The baseline \nsum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor \nregression in the measurable dimension of the disease.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should \nalso be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be \nfollowed as \u2018present\u2019, \u2018absent\u2019, or in rare cases \u2018unequivocal progression\u2019. In addition, it is \npossible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on \nthe case record form (eg, \u2018multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes\u2019 or \u2018multiple liver \nmetastases\u2019).\nDefinition of Tumor Response \nTarget Lesions\nResponse in target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. \n\uf0b7\nPartial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum \nif that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum \nmust also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one \nor more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression.\n\uf0b7\nStable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient \nincrease to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on \nstudy.\nWhen nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to \n\u2018normal\u2019 size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This \nmeasurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate \nprogression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means \nthat patients with CR may not have a total sum of \u2018zero\u2019 on the CRF.\nNon-Target Lesions\nWhile some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and \ninstead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. \nResponse in non-target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization \nof tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm \nshort axis).\n\uf0b7\nNon-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or \nmaintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 71\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.\n(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).\nCytology, Histology \nThese techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by \nprotocol (for example, residual lesions in germ cell tumors). When effusions are known to \nbe a potential adverse effect of treatment (eg, taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), \nthe cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens \nduring treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or \nstable disease in order to differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive \ndisease.\nFor patients having effusions or ascites, only cases having cytological proof of malignancy \nshould be recorded on the CRF. Effusions that have not been evaluated using cytology or \nwere found to be non-malignant should not be recorded on the CRF. \nNew Lesions \nThe appearance of new malignant lesions indicates PD. New lesion should be unequivocal\n(eg, not attributable to differences in imaging technique, or change in imaging modality or \nfindings not attributable to tumor). If a new lesion is equivocal, for example due to its small \nsize, continued therapy and follow-up assessment will clarify the etiology of the disease. If \nrepeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared \nusing the date of the initial scan. \nThe use of FDG-PET is sometimes reasonable to complement a CT scan assessment of a PD \n(particularly for possible \u2018new\u2019 disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can \nbe identified according to the following algorithm: \n\uf0b7\nNegative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up.\n\uf0b7\nNo FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow- up: if the positive \nFDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is \nPD.\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, \nadditional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring \nat that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that \nis not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 72\nConfirmation of Tumor Response \nConfirmation of response is required for non-randomized trials with primary endpoint \nof response, but is not required in randomized studies since the control arm serves as \nappropriate means of interpretation of data.\nDetermination of Overall Response by RECIST version 1.1\nWhen both target and non-target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded \nseparately. The overall assessment of response will involve all parameters as depicted in\nTable 5.\nTable 5.\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\nTarget \nlesions\nNon-target \nlesions\nNew\nLesions\nOverall\nresponse\nCR\nCR\nNo\nCR\nCR\nNon-CR/non-P\nD\nNo\nPR\nCR\nNot evaluated\nNo\nPR\nPR\nNon-PD or\nnot all evaluated\nNo\nPR\nSD\nNon-PD or\nnot all evaluated\nNo\nSD\nNot all\nevaluated\nNon-PD\nNo\nNE\nPD\nAny\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nPD\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nAny\nYes\nPD\nCR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease,\nPD = progressive disease, and NE = inevaluable.\nBest Overall Response\nThe best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known. Best \nresponse in trials in which confirmation of complete or partial response is not required \n(ie, randomized trails) is defined as the best response across all time points (for example, a \npatient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment \nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 73\nhas a best overall response of PR). When SD is believed to be the best response, it must also \nmeet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline. If the minimum time is not met \nwhen SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient\u2019s best response depends on the \nsubsequent assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD at \nsecond and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD. The \nsame patient lost to follow-up after the first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable. \nWhen confirmation of CR and PR is required (ie, non-randomized trials with primary \nendpoint of response), the best overall response is defined according to the tumor response \nalong the study.  Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each \nare met at a following time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).\nPatients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment \nwithout objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as\n\u2018symptomatic deterioration\u2019. Every effort should be made to document objective progression \neven after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an \nobjective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of \nsuch patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target lesions.\nIn some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. \nWhen the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the \nresidual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before assigning a status of \ncomplete response. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner \nsimilar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent \nfibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively \ndescribed in the protocol and supported by disease specific medical literature for the \nindication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false \npositive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.\n",

The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to \ncharacterize each identified and reported lesion at screening/baseline and during the \nstudy.\n5. Lesions noted on physical examination, such as skin nodules and lymph nodes, will \nbe considered measurable only if they are superficial and are \uf0b310 mm at initial \nassessment.  As often as possible, the same investigator using the same method of \nmeasurement should assess these lesions at all visits.\nD. Baseline Documentation of \u201cIndex\u201d and \u201cNonIndex\u201d Lesions\n1. Up to a maximum of 6 of the largest dominant lesions should be identified and \nrecorded as Index lesions and measured at baseline.  These nodes or masses should \nbe selected according to the following features:\n\uf0b7\nThey should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions;\n\uf0b7\nThey should be from as disparate regions of the body as possible;\n\uf0b7\nThey should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever \nthese sites are involved; and\n\uf0b7\nThey should be suitable for accurate repeated measurements (eg, relationship to \nidentifiable landmarks).\n2. The product of the longest transverse diameter and the longest perpendicular \ntransverse diameter will be recorded for all Index lesions.  The sum of the product \ndiameters (SPD) for all Index lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline \nSPD.  The baseline individual product diameters and the baseline SPD will be used as \nthe references by which the objective tumor response will be characterized.\n3. All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as NonIndex lesions and \nmust also be recorded at baseline.  Both nodal and non-nodal (eg, masses present in \nthe liver and/or spleen) are recorded.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, \nbut the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout the study.\nE. Response Criteria\n1. Complete Response (CR) requires the following:\na.\nComplete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of \ndisease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before \ntherapy.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 76\nb. All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed on CT to normal size \n(\uf0a31.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes >1.5 cm before therapy).  \nPreviously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and more \nthan 1.0 cm in their short axis before treatment must have decreased to \uf0a31 cm in \ntheir in their short axis after treatment.  NOTE for PET scans: for patients with no \npretreatment PET scan or when a PET scan was positive before treatment, a \npost-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.\nc.\nThe spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT scan, \nmust have regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical examination.  \nAny macroscopic nodules in any organs detectable on imaging techniques should \nno longer be present.  Other organs considered to be enlarged before therapy as a \nresult of involvement by lymphoma such as liver and kidneys, must have \ndecreased in size.\nd. If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate \nmust be cleared on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy of the same site.  The \nsample on which this determination is made must be adequate (\uf0b320 mm biopsy \ncore).  If a sample is indeterminate by morphology, it should be negative by \nimmunohistochemistry.  A sample that is negative by immunohistochemistry but \nthat demonstrates a small population of clonal lymphocytes by flow cytometry \nwill be considered a CR until data become available demonstrating a clear \ndifference in patient outcome.\n2. Partial Response (PR) requires the following:\na.\n\uf0b350% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.\nb. No increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.\nc.\nSplenic and hepatic nodules must regress by \uf0b350% in the SPD, or for single \nnodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.\nd. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other \norgans is usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present.\ne.\nBone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR because it is \nassessable and not measurable disease; however, if positive, the cell type \nshould be specified in the report (eg, large-cell lymphoma, or low-grade \nlymphoma such as small, lymphocytic small cleaved, or mixed small and \nlarge cells).  Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria, but who have \npersistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial \nresponders.  When the bone marrow was involved before treatment and a \nclinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after \ntreatment, patients should be considered partial responders.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 77\nf.\nNo new sites of disease.\ng. NOTES for PET: For patients with follicular, diffuse large B-cell, or \nmantle-cell lymphomas (ie, typically FDG-avid lymphomas) and with no \npretreatment PET scan or with a positive pretreatment PET scan, the \npost-treatment PET should be positive in at least one previously involved site.  \nFor patients with other NHLs (ie, variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity \nunknown) and without a pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan \nwas negative, CT criteria should be used.  In patients with follicular or \nmantle-cell lymphomas, a PET scan is only indicated with one or at most two \nresidual masses that have regressed by more than 50% on CT; those with \nmore than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be \nconsidered partial responders.\n3. Stable disease (SD) is defined as less than a PR (see above) but is NOT progressive \ndisease (see below, progressive disease).\na. NOTES for PET: For patients with follicular, diffuse large B-cell, or \nmantle-cell lymphomas (ie, typically FDG-avid lymphomas), the PET should \nbe positive at prior sites of disease with no new areas of involvement on the \npost-treatment CT or PET.  For patients with other NHLs (ie, variably \nFDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown) and without a pretreatment \nPET scan or with a negative pretreatment PET, there must be no change in \nthe size of the previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan.\n4. Relapsed disease (after CR)/ Progressive disease (after PR or SD) requires the \nfollowing:\na.\nNOTE: Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more \nthan 1.5 cm regardless of the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of \n1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is more \nthan 1.0 cm.  Lymph nodes \uf0a31.0 \uf0b4\uf0a31.0 cm will not be considered as \nabnormal for relapse or progressive disease.\nb. Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the \nend of treatment, even if other lesions are decreasing in size.  NOTE for PET: \nIncreased FDG uptake in a previously unaffected site should only be \nconsidered relapsed or progressive disease after confirmation with other \nmodalities.\nc.\nAt least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved \nnodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or \nhepatic nodules).  To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a \ndiameter of the short axis of less than 1.0 cm must increase by \uf0b350% and to a \nsize of 1.5 \uf0b41.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 78\nd. At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously \nidentified node more than 1 cm in its short axis.\ne.\nNOTE for PET: Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical \nFDG-avid lymphoma (ie, follicular, diffuse large B-cell, or mantle-cell \nlymphomas) or the lesion was PET positive before treatment unless the lesion \nis too small to be detected with current PET systems (<1.5 cm in its long axis \nby CT).\nf.\nNOTE: Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar \nto that for nodal disease.  For these recommendations, the spleen is considered \nnodal disease.  Disease that is only assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone \nlesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, while an \nabnormality is still noted by imaging studies or physical examination, it is \nfound to be histologically negative.\nEvaluation of Non-Index Lesions: Although a clear progression of \"Non Index\" \nlesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating \nphysician should prevail and the progression status should be confirmed later by \nthe review panel.\nCrizotinib (PF-02341066)\nA8081013\nFinal Protocol Amendment 5, 13 August 2015\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 79\nResponse Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nResponse Category\nDefinition\nNodal Masses\nSpleen, Liver\nBone Marrow\nCR\nDisappearance \nof all evidence \nof disease\nRegression to \nnormal size on \nCTa\nNot palpable, \nnodules \ndisappeared\ninfiltrate \ncleared on \nrepeat biopsyb\nPR\nRegression of \nmeasurable \ndisease and no \nnew sites\n\uf0b350% decrease \nin SPD of \uf0a36 \nlargest dominant \nmasses; no \nincrease in size \nof other nodesc\n\uf0b350% decrease \nin SPD of \nnodules;d no \nincrease in size \nof liver or \nspleen\nIrrelevant if \npositive \npretreatment; \ncell type \nshould be \nspecified\nSD\nFailure to attain \nCR, PR or \nprogressive \ndisease\nOn CT: no new \nsites; no change \nin size of \nprevious \nlesionse\nRelapsed or\nProgressive \nDisease\nNew lesion or \nincrease by \n\uf0b350% of \npreviously \ninvolved sites \nfrom nadir\nNew lesion(s) \n>1.5 cm (any \naxis); \uf0b350% \nincrease in SPD \nof >1 node; or \n\uf0b350% increase \nin longest \ndiameter of \npreviously \nidentified node \n>1 cm in short \naxisf\n>50% increase \nfrom nadir in \nthe SPD of any \nprevious\nlesions\nNew or \nrecurrent \ninvolvement\nReference: Cheson DB, Pfistner B, Juweid ME, Gascoyne RD, Specht L, Horning SJ, et al.

Response Evaluation\n1. Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of \ntreatment without objective evidence of progressive disease at that time should be \nclassified as having \"symptomatic deterioration.\"  Every effort should be made to \ndocument the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.\n2. Evaluation of Best Overall Response: The best overall response is the best response \nrecorded from the start of the treatment until progressive disease/recurrence (taking as \nreference for progressive disease, the smallest measurements recorded since the \ntreatment started).\n3. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be \nconfirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed \uf0b34 weeks after the criteria \nfor response are first met.\nG. Duration of Response\n1. Overall Response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time \nmeasurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until \nthe first date that recurrence or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking \nas reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the \ntreatment started.\n2. Stable Disease: SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for \nprogressive disease are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded \nsince the treatment started.  The minimal time interval for duration of SD is 4 weeks.\n3. Time to Progression: Time to progression is the interval from the start of the \ntreatment until the first date that recurrence or progression, or death secondary to \nprogression is documented, censored at the last evaluation.\n",

All cycles are \n3 weeks in duration. Sufficient study medication for a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment will be dispensed at each \nclinic visit.  During the non-clinical visit cycles, the Investigator is responsible for ensuring the patient contacts the \nclinical site in order to provide an update of adverse events and concomitant medications. \n2.\nEnd of Treatment/Withdrawal: Obtain blood pressure, pulse rate, hematology and LFTs, and physical examination if \nnot completed during the previous 4 weeks on study.\n3.\nPhysical Examination: Includes an examination of major body systems and weight.\n4.\nOphthalmologic Examination: Includes visual acuity, slit lamp, and fundoscopy, and should be performed by an \nophthalmologist.  The ophthalmologic examination should be repeated during the study when visual disturbances have \nbeen observed and when there is an increase in the grade for visual disturbances.  \n5.\nHematology, Liver function tests and Urinalysis: Required tests are listed in Table 7. \nWhere possible, laboratory tests should be performed preferably at the clinical site\u2019s local laboratory, and, when not \npossible, patients will provide the laboratory test results copy (from the non-clinical site laboratory), eg, by telephone,\nand bring a copy of the laboratory test results at the visit; process depends on local medical practice.  The copy of the \nlaboratory test results must be retained in the patient\u2019s file at the clinical site for documentation purposes.  If ALT or \nAST \uf0b3Grade 3 or ALT or AST \uf0b3Grade 2 and total bilirubin \uf0b3Grade 2, obtain repeat ALT or AST and total bilirubin \nwithin 48 hours and then repeat every 48-72 hours until ALT/AST Grade \uf0a31.\n6.\nReflex Microscopy required if urine dipstick is positive for blood or protein.\n7.\nSerum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test, with sensitivity of \nat least 25 mIU/mL, will be routinely performed at every cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study\ntreatment, and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise \nsuspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by institutional review board/ethics \ncommittee (IRB/ECs) or if required by local regulations.\n8.\nContraceptive Check: Male patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing \npotential will need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of at least 2 of the selected methods of \ncontraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the need to use 2 highly effective \ncontraception methods consistently and correctly and document such conversation in the patient\u2019s chart.  In addition, \nthe investigator or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately if aone or both selected \ncontraception methods is are discontinued, or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the patient\u2019s partner.  \n9.\nTumor Assessments: Will be repeated at the frequency as per local clinical practice, and will no longer be recorded on \nthe CRF. However, tumor assessment information should be retained in the patient\u2019s file for documentation purposes.\n10. Adverse Events: For serious adverse events, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative \nbegins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient\u2019s participation \nin the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and \nincluding 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product.
