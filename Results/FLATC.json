        "chunk_text": "Amendment RationaleAs the final label and reimbursement guidelines were unknown at the outset of the fingolimod clinical program, some patients enrolled in the core trials and subsequently transitioned into this protocol are currently ineligible for commercially reimbursed Gilenya.  Based on the assumption that continued study participation means there is a positive benefit-risk paradigm for these patients, Novartis elected to extend this protocol for up to two additional years, to allow continued fingolimod use until countries and investigators can find alternate treatment solutions.  Therefore, this protocol is being amended to update the study design, offering continued patient participation in a subset of patients (those unable to obtain access to/reimbursement for commercial Gilenya) for an additional (approximately) two years, through June 2018.  In keeping with the original protocol objective, safety and tolerability data will continue to be collected during this time period.This study is ongoing with approximately 4,150 enrolled patients.  Endorsement of this amendment will allow patients whose disease is being managed by fingolimod to have continued access, while allowing for continued collection of long-term safety and tolerability data.Changes to the protocolChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions.The major changes made to the protocol are summarized in this section. Other minor changes are incorporated directly into the protocol.

        "chunk_text": "Amendment rationaleThe protocol is being amended to address safety updates in the investigator brochure (Edition 18) \u2013 in particular to provide additional guidance for safety monitoring for opportunistic infections and for basal cell carcinoma.  Second, this amendment provides details regarding the Study Completion visit scheduling for all patients, and re-introduces hematology testing at every visit.Notably, there have been reports of isolated cases of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with relapsing MS receiving fingolimod. As a result, the fingolimod local product labeling will be updated to guide prescribers for vigilance, early detection, and diagnosis of such cases, should they occur. Similarly, the infection safety monitoring guidance is being updated in this protocol.Basal cell carcinoma has been reported in patients receiving fingolimod. The physical examination section has been amended to ask patients about any new or worsening skin lesions and to instruct investigators to refer patients to the dermatologist in cases where suspected precancerous or cancerous skin lesions are identified.This study planned to end by 30-Jun-2016 in order to collect 60 months or more of long-term safety data for the majority of Phase II/III patients.   Guidance regarding scheduling of the Study Completion visit is provided in order to streamline the study closure processes, specifically designating the Study Completion visit to occur at or shortly after sixty months of study participation for those patients who would reach 60 months by 30-Jun-2016.  Patients not reaching 60 months by 30-Jun-2016 will have their study completion on or around 30-Jun-2016 (+/- 30 day visit window), and patient who have already reached 60 months should have their Study Completion visit at their next six monthly visit, or 30-Jun-2016, whichever comes first.Hematology testing has been re-instituted at the six monthly visits (i.e., every study visit) to provide additional lymphocyte count information to study sites.  This study is an ongoing study with approximately 4,150 enrolled patients.  These changes will ensure that study patients receive the same information and care that patients on commercial Gilenya will receive, provide additional lymphocyte monitoring, and clarify the upcoming study completion visit scheduling.NovartisConfidentialPage 13Amended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 CleanProtocol No. CFTY720D2399Changes to the protocolChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions.The major changes made to the protocol are summarized in this section.

        "chunk_text": "Amendment rationale The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the continued safety and tolerability of fingolimod over longer periods of time. The Gilenya Risk Management Plan (RMP) provides guidance for the minimum safety monitoring required. During a review of the protocol, it was identified that the protocol has more stringent monitoring frequency than recommended in the RMP and standard of care. Thus, in an effort to reduce patient and site burden, in addition to managing internal resources, some clinical monitoring has been amended to reflect current RMP guidance.This is an ongoing study with approximately 4,000 enrolled patients. These changes will reduce patient and site burden while continuing to collect data supporting the study objectives, without negatively impacting standard of care or the final study results.Changes to the protocolChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions.NovartisConfidentialPage 14Amended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 CleanProtocol No. CFTY720D2399The major changes made to the protocol are summarized in this section.

        "chunk_text": "Amendment rationaleVaricella zoster virus (VZV) antibody testing and surveillance in patients enrolled in this extension, including patients enrolled from core studies prior to implementation of mandatory pre-treatment anti-VZV antibody serology, has been clarified in accordance with the 2013 Core Data Sheet (CDS) update. The language is reinforced to ensure that previous history of varicella or varicella vaccination is adequately documented by a health care professional and wording has been strengthened regarding the need for patients to be tested for antibodies to determine prior VZV exposure and to vaccinate if negative.The title of the study was changed back to the original version in response to feedback from the central ethics committee for France. This change indicates that only uncontrolled efficacy data are collected in this study, which may be subject to bias, as compared to the more rigorous efficacy data collected in a double-blind randomized study. Furthermore, the title clarifies that only patients with relapsing MS were included in the core studies from which the patients in trial D2399 are enrolled. Several additional administrative changes were made to clarify the revised screening laboratory tests and schedule of assessments, which were implemented in Amendment 6.Reversion of title back to original title will allow French cohort of patients to continue in the trial and ensure additional awareness of VZV guidance for all countries.

        "chunk_text": "Amendment rationaleIn November 2011, there was a sudden, unexplained death of a patient within 24 hours after the administration of the first dose of fingolimod 0.5 mg.  While the cause of death wasunknown and the role of fingolimod had not been confirmed or excluded, the event prompted a thorough review of cardiac safety data from clinical trials as well as spontaneous reports in the post-marketing setting. Following this review, additional observation beyond 6 hours is recommended for individuals who may be at risk of later occurring events based on certain defined criteria.  To that end, changes to the protocol are implemented in all countries to specify which ECG abnormalities and heart rate thresholds should lead to continued observation of patients beyond the mandatory 6-hour first dose observation period.Continued observation beyond 6 hours is required for patients who, at the end of the first dose observation period, have a heart rate (HR) of <45 beats per minute (bpm), new onset second degree or higher AV block, or if the HR at 6 hours post-dose is the lowest value post-dose. Given that QT prolongation in the presence of marked bradycardia may be associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, it is specified that continued observation will also be required for patients whose QTc on the 6-hour ECG is 500 msec or greater. Continued observation should be maintained until the event leading to the continued observation hasresolved.  These criteria are in addition to those already in place, i.e. patients with symptomatic bradycardia and those in whom the 6-hour HR is the nadir of the observation period.In addition to the guidance above, patients initiating or re-initiating treatment in Germany will also require continuous ECG monitoring during the 6-hour observation period. If this continuous ECG monitoring shows either persistent second degree AV block Mobitz type I at 6 hours, second degree AV Mobitz type II or higher, AV block at any time, or a HR at 6 hours post-dose that is 20 bpm or more lower than the pre-dose HR, extended monitoring will be necessary until the event leading to the extended monitoring has resolved. These guidelines will be specified where required throughout the protocol.Patient enrollment started in September 2010.  At the time of this amendment, approximately 3750 patients have enrolled into the study.  It is not expected that the changes implemented in this amendment will affect the patient population.Changes to the protocolChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. The major changes made to the protocol are summarized in this section. Other minor changes are incorporated directly into the protocol.

        "chunk_text": "Amendment rationaleThis Amendment aims to further define the extended follow-up for patients who previously completed the phase II or III fingolimod clinical development studies in an interventional trial setting through 30-Jun-2016. It extends the enrollment to patients who have completed CFTY720D2309/E1 as well as the re-enrollment of CFTY720D2399 patients who have previously completed this study based on the original CFTY720D2399 study endpoint of local approval and reimbursement. Furthermore, this amendment will define additional assessments to evaluate the long-term efficacy of fingolimod in phase II and III trial patients. Lastly, this amendment aims to bring the study schedule of assessments as well as the safety monitoring guidelines in alignment with the fingolimod prescribing information of major countries where the medication has been registered.As indicated in Amendment 3, patients who were participating in the fingolimod phase II/III development program have 2.5 to over 8 years of long-term exposure. The patient population included in these trials is particularly suitable for long-term evaluation for several reasons: patients have met specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, are well characterized at baseline, havea well-documented clinical course throughout their participation in the individual clinical trials and include patients who were randomized to placebo or active comparator during their core studies. Thus, these patients already have documented long-term data on the safety and efficacy of fingolimod treatment, coupled with careful baseline assessments. Maintaining these patients in the context of an interventional study will allow for the continued collection of rigorous long-term data. Therefore, in addition to following long-term safety, this amendment adds assessments to obtain additional long-term efficacy data, including confirmed relapse data and EDSS-based disability progression, as well as MRI assessments measuring lesion burden and brain atrophy. Contrary to patients included in the phase II and pivotal MS studies, patients having participated in phase IIIb studies have limited fingolimod exposure in predominantly uncontrolled studies of short duration. Since these studies focused on specific safety assessments, MS baseline characteristics were not as well documented since patient selection Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 19\nAmended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 Clean\nProtocol No. CFTY720D2399\nwas not based on disease activity and history and the clinical course of MS during these short \ntrials was not followed based on rigorous efficacy assessments, such as relapse confirmation, \nblinded EDSS rating, and MRI. Therefore, these patients will continue to follow the current \nstudy endpoint of local approval and reimbursement. The patients who are not eligible for \nreimbursement will be allowed to remain in this study for an additional 180 days.  \nPhase II/III patients, who met the original study endpoint in CFTY720D2399 of approval and \nreimbursement for fingolimod in their respective countries will be invited to rejoin this study \nin order to continue participation through 30-Jun-2016 and add to the collection of long-term \nsafety and efficacy data. In addition, patients from the CFTY720D2309/E1 study who may \nnot have had the opportunity to enroll into this study based on the original study endpoint will \nalso be invited to participate in this study through 30-Jun-2016.\nThe schedule of assessments, frequency of visits, and the safety monitoring guidelines have\nbeen updated to reflect the fingolimod prescribing information of major countries where the \nmedication has already been approved. Any additional assessments required by the local \nlabels should be performed as required in the context of routine clinical care. In addition \nefficacy measurements, i.e. MRI assessments (including brain atrophy), relapse data, and \ndisability progression, have been added for patients with a documented baseline in order to \nobtain additional long-term efficacy data.\nChanges to the protocol\nChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the \nprotocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions.\nThe major changes made to the protocol are summarized in this section.

In addition, patients who have participated in and completed ongoing phase IIIb studies of fingolimod are also eligible.  Patients who participated in the phase IIIb trials initiated treatment with fingolimod only recently. Patients who were participating in the phase II/III development program have 2-7 years of continuous exposure and met specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and have very well documented clinical course over those years. These latter patients provide valuable long-term data on safety and efficacy of fingolimod treatment, coupled with careful baseline assessments.The rationale of this amendment is to allow further follow-up of those patients who previously completed the Phase II or III fingolimod clinical development trials in an interventional trial setting through 30-Jun-2016.

As of 29-Feb-2012, the MS clinical trials exposure in global and local studies is \nestimated to be approximately 16,500 patient-years, reached in more than 10,000 MS patients \ntreated with fingolimod in Phase II, III, IIIb, and IV studies and their extensions.  For updated \nexposure and safety information, please refer to current investigator brochure.\nThe safety profile observed in the fingolimod MS clinical development program can be \nsummarized as follows:\n\uf0b7\nThe overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was slightly higher\nfor the fingolimod 0.5 mg/day (10.5%) than the placebo group (8.7%), and higher again in\nthe fingolimod 1.25 mg/day group (14.1%). The overall incidence of SAEs was \ncomparable between fingolimod groups (11.6% and 10.5% for 1.25 mg/day and 0.5 \nmg/day, respectively) and placebo (12.2%). \n\uf0b7\nSpecific AEs that were reported more commonly in MS patients treated with fingolimod \nthan placebo included elevation of liver enzymes, in particular increases in ALT and GGT, \nreduction in white blood cell counts (lymphocytes and total WBC), transient bradycardia \nfollowing the post first dose of fingolimod, macular edema, hypertension, dyspnea, \nbronchitis, and diarrhea. The AEs most prominently associated with fingolimod treatment, \ne.g. liver enzyme elevations, bradycardia, and macular edema appeared to show a dose \nrelated response. There were no AEs that appeared to be specifically related to long-term\ntreatment with fingolimod.\n\uf0b7\nIn general, the AE profile of fingolimod in MS patients did not depend on gender, age, or \nprevious treatment with disease-modifying drugs. The only exception was liver enzyme \nelevations which were more frequent in male patients than in female patients treated with \nfingolimod.\n\uf0b7\nThe overall incidence of infections, including serious infections, was similar in the \nfingolimod treatment groups and the comparator arms (interferon or placebo) in both \ncompleted phase III studies. A slightly higher frequency of lower respiratory tract \ninfections (primarily bronchitis) was observed in fingolimod treated patients, with \napparent dose effect. Two fatal infections occurred in the fingolimod 1.25 mg/day group: \none case of disseminated varicella-zoster virus in a sero-negative patient receiving \nconcomitant high dose steroid therapy for an MS relapse, and one case of herpes simplex \nencephalitis in a patient in whom initiation of acyclovir therapy was delayed by one week. \nThe current data showed no clear relationship between lymphocyte count and the \nincidence of infections on fingolimod treatment.  The accumulated data from the MS \nprogram do not show an association of fingolimod therapy with the development of \nmalignancies. Cases of lymphoma (cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders or \ndiffuse B-cell lymphoma) were reported in premarketing clinical trials in MS patients \nreceiving fingolimod at, or above, the recommended dose of 0.5 mg. Based on the small \nnumber of reported cases and short duration of exposure, the relationship to fingolimod \nremains uncertain.\n\uf0b7\nInitiation of fingolimod treatment has been associated with atrio-ventricular conduction \ndelays usually as first-degree atrio-ventricular blocks (prolonged PR interval on ECG). \nSecond-degree atrio-ventricular blocks, usually Mobitz type I (Wenckebach), have been \nobserved in less than 0.5% of patients receiving fingolimod 0.5 mg in clinical trials.

        "chunk_text": " The clinical development program of fingolimod has demonstrated efficacy and a favorable  benefit/risk ratio of the fingolimod 0.5 mg/day dose in patients with relapsing-remitting  multiple sclerosis (RRMS), based on reduction in the annualized relapse rate, the reduction in  risk for disability progression, and reduction of inflammatory activity and brain atrophy in the  brain as evidenced by MRI. The safety profile of fingolimod has been well characterized in  comparison to both placebo and a first-line treatment active comparator. The specific areas of  concern in the safety profile of fingolimod have been identified and are addressed as  appropriate in this protocol. This study is designed to collect long-term safety, tolerability, efficacy and health outcomes data in eligible patients who participated in the fingolimod multiple sclerosis clinical  development program. An open-label, non-comparative single arm design is considered adequate for this type of  long-term extension. Neither a placebo-control can be justified over the long-term nor does  the logistical burden for patients and study sites justify the use of an active comparator arm. The visit and assessment schedule has been aligned with common medical practice in the care  for patients with MS and with fingolimod treatment. Based on the assumption that continued  study participation means there is a positive benefit-risk paradigm for these patients, Part Two  of the protocol has been added, offering continued patient participation in a subset of patients  (those unable to obtain access to/reimbursement for commercial Gilenya) for an additional  (approximately) two years, through June 2018.  This will allow continued fingolimod use  until countries and investigators can find alternate treatment solutions.   In Study Part One, safety and tolerability data will be collected at regular intervals, in addition  to EDSS assessments and periodic MRI scans, which will document chronic disease  progression in terms of physical disability and brain tissue loss without undue burden on the  patient. Study Part Two will collect safety and tolerability data only. ",

EDSS is a scale for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It is a two-part system including: (1) a series of scores in each of eight functional systems, and (2) the EDSS steps (ranging  from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). The functional systems are Visual, Brain Stem,  Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel and Bladder, Cerebral and other functions. It is  recommended that fatigue will not be included into the Cerebral score of the EDSS. For patients coming from phase II/III studies, EDSS will be assessed by a treating physician who has been EDSS trained.  A one-time Neurostatus certification is required for all  evaluating physicians who have patients enrolled from phase II/III studies.  If a new rater is  brought on board at any time throughout the study, proof of certification of that rater will be  required at that time before any EDSS assessments can be done by the new rater. A certified backup evaluating physician should be appointed to conduct neurological examination ONLY  when the primary evaluating physician is unavailable due to illness, vacation, or travel.  Blinding of the evaluators is not required in this protocol and the PI can serve as the rater  provided training requirements have been met.  For patients who transferred from trials other than the phase II/III trials, the individual  functional scores do not need to be collected, and the evaluating physician performing EDSS  assessments does not have to carry a certification. EDSS assessments are detailed in Table 6-1. Refer to Appendix 8 for information on  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). ",

Notable abnormalities are defined in the Criteria for \nclinically notable laboratory values and vital signs further specified in Appendix 1.\n \n \n \n6.5.4.2\nClinical Chemistry\nBlood samples will be collected as described in Table 6-1 and 6-2, and will include the \nfollowing parameters: sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, blood \nurea nitrogen (BUN), random glucose, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, ALT, AST, \nGGT, amylase, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and\nLDL. Abnormal laboratory parameters, inconsistent with clinical presentation of MS or \nsuspicious of underlying medical condition, should be repeated for accuracy.    If an increase\nof amylase above the clinically notable value (\u2265300 U/L) is observed at any subsequent visits, \na lipase should be tested to determine the origin of elevated amylase (pancreatic versus extra \npancreatic). Refer to the Guidance on monitoring patients with elevated liver function tests in\nAppendix 5.\nIt is recommended that patients without a health care professional confirmed history of \nchickenpox or documentation of a full course of vaccination with varicella vaccine undergo \nantibody testing to varicella zoster virus (VZV) before initiating fingolimod. Serology testing \nwill therefore be performed at Baseline for any patient that has not undergone this testing \nduring participation in their previous fingolimod trial to determine the patient's immune status \n(IgG antibodies will be measured) for varicella zoster virus. A full course of vaccination for \nantibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing \ntreatment with fingolimod.\nPatients who are negative for varicella-zoster virus IgG antibodies at baseline, and wish to be \nimmunized, will need to interrupt study treatment for 2 months prior to vaccination. \nFollowing vaccination, the re-initiation of study drug should be postponed for 1 month to \nallow full effect of vaccination to occur. Patients who have been tested for VZV antibodies \nand have confirmed negative test results may continue participation, provided they are \ncounseled on the importance of avoiding possible sources of exposure and the importance of \ninforming their physician promptly, should any symptoms of infection develop.  Patients who \nchoose not to be vaccinated may enroll into this trial, per discretion of the investigator. A \npositive IgG antibody result does not indicate active infection per se, but only evidence of \nprior exposure to viral antigens through past infection or vaccination. Patients with prior \ninfection may be at risk of viral reactivation (e.g. shingles) and should be instructed to inform \nthe investigator of any signs or symptoms suggestive of these conditions, so that prompt \ntreatment may be initiated.\nPatients will also be tested for uncontrolled diabetes and serological markers for hepatitis A, \nB, C and E indicating acute or chronic infection at baseline as part of the revised screening \nlaboratory assessments as described in Table 6-1.\nPlease refer to the Guidance on monitoring of patients with infections in Appendix 5.\n",

The treating physician should refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for an exam and/or OCT  if clinically warranted. An OCT and ophthalmologic exam will be performed by an  ophthalmologist at Month 3 for any patient rolling into this study from a blinded study which  has comparator treatment arms (placebo or active comparator) and for any patient who has  been off fingolimod treatment for 90 days or greater.  The OCT will be done to evaluate the  presence of any abnormalities consistent with macular edema.   Patients with a history of or newly diagnosed uveitis after initiation of study drug may require  more frequent ophthalmic evaluations. Refer to the Guidance for Ophthalmic Monitoring Appendix 7 for details on monitoring of patients with uveitis during the study. Continuation of fingolimod in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated. A  decision on whether or not study drug should be re-initiated after resolution of macular edema  needs to take into consideration the potential benefits and risks to the individual patient. Patients that are diagnosed with macular edema should be followed-up monthly after  diagnosis of macular edema and more frequently if needed, based on the ophthalmologist\u2019s  judgment. Further ophthalmologic evaluations will be conducted until such time as resolution  is confirmed or no further improvement is expected by the ophthalmologist (based on a  follow-up period of not less than 3 months). If the patient does not show definite signs of  improvement on examination by specialist testing (e.g. OCT) after 6-8 weeks after  discontinuation of study drug, then therapy for macular edema in conjunction with an  ophthalmologist experienced in the management of this condition should be initiated.

The model will include treatment and baseline volume of \nT2 lesions as continuous covariates.\nBrain volume: Percent brain volume change from baseline will be estimated based on a \nmixed effects model with repeated measures and auto-regressive within-subject covariance \nstructure of first order will be used with visit, treatment, core baseline normalized brain \nvolume, number of Gd-enhancing lesions at FDF baseline, and T2 lesion volume at FDF \nbaseline as fixed effects, and individual patient as a random effect. Kenward and Rogers\u2019 \nadjustment for the degrees of freedom will be applied. Annualized rate of brain atrophy \n(ARBA) will also be estimated based on the same mixed effects model.\n9.5.1.3\nEDSS\nDescriptive statistics on absolute EDSS scores (overall and by function), change from FDF\nbaseline, and count (%) based on EDSS change categories will be presented. The proportion\nof patients with 6-month confirmed disability progression will be presented. Data on time to \n6-month confirmed disability progression, and EDSS score of 4, 6, 7 will be summarized. \nEDSS will be used for the confirmation of MS relapse and the confirmation of disability \nprogression.  Disability progression in this study is defined as an increase in the EDSS score \nby 1.5 point for patients with an FDF baseline EDSS of 0, 1 point for patients with an FDF\nbaseline EDSS of \u22651 and \u22645.5, and by 0.5 points for patients with an FDF baseline \nEDSS >5.5, confirmed after 6 months and at all intermediate EDSS assessments.\n",

MSFC components should be administered in the following order:1. Trial 1, Timed 25-Foot Walk2. Trial 2, Timed 25-Foot Walk3. Trial 1, Dominant Hand, 9-HPT4. Trial 2, Dominant Hand, 9-HPT5. Trial 1, Non-Dominant Hand, 9-HPT6. Trial 2, Non-Dominant Hand, 9-HPT7.PASATINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TIMED 25 FOOT WALKDESCRIPTIONThe Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. It is the first component of the MSFC administered at each visit. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot (7.62 m) course and is instructed to walk 25 feet (7.62 meter) as quickly as possible, but safely. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task. In clinical trials, it is recommended that the study physician selects the appropriate assistive device for each patient.MATERIALS NEEDEDStopwatch, clipboard, Timed 25-Foot Walk Record Form, marked 25-foot (7.62 m) distance in an unobstructed hallway, assistive device (if needed).TIME LIMIT PER TRIAL3 minutes (180 seconds) per trial.Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 73\nAmended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 Clean\nProtocol No. CFTY720D2399\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE 9-HOLE PEG TEST\nDESCRIPTION\nThe 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The 9-HPT \nis the second component of the MSFC to be administered. Both the dominant and non-\ndominant hands are tested twice (two consecutive trials of the dominant hand, followed \nimmediately by two consecutive trials of the non-dominant hand). It is important that the 9-\nHPT be administered on a solid table (not a rolling hospital bedside table) and that the small \nrubber feet are fixed under the 9-HPT apparatus (or the apparatus be anchored by other \nmethod).\nMATERIALS NEEDED\n9-HPT apparatus, stopwatch, clipboard, 9-HPT Record Form\nTIME LIMIT PER TRIAL\n5 minutes (300 seconds)\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PACED AUDITORY SERIAL ADDITION TEST (PASAT)\nDESCRIPTION\nThe PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information \nprocessing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. The PASAT is the last measure \nadministered at each visit. It is presented on audio CD to control the rate of stimulus \npresentation. Single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the patient must add each new \ndigit to the one immediately prior to it. The test result is the number of correct sums given \n(out of 60 possible). To minimize familiarity with stimulus items in clinical trials and other \nserial studies, two alternate forms have been developed; the order of these should be \ncounterbalanced across testing sessions.\nMATERIALS NEEDED\nCD player, audio CD with PASAT stimuli, clipboard, PASAT Record Forms.\nNovartisConfidentialPage 74Amended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 CleanProtocol No. CFTY720D2399",

        "chunk_text": " Initiation of fingolimod treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate. After the first dose, the heart rate decrease starts within an hour and the Day 1 decline is maximal within 6 hours. With continued dosing, heart rate returns to baseline within one month of chronic treatment. In patients receiving fingolimod 0.5 mg this decrease in heart rate, as measured by pulse, averages approximately 8 beats per minute (bpm). Heart rates below 40 bpm were rarely observed. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic but some patients experienced mild to moderate symptoms.Initiation of fingolimod treatment has been associated with AV conduction delays, usually as first-degree atrio-ventricular blocks. Second-degree AV blocks, usually Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) have been observed in less than 0.5% of patients receiving Gilenya 0.5 mg in clinical trials. The conduction abnormalities typically were transient, asymptomatic, usually did not require treatment and resolved within the first 24-hours on treatment. Isolated cases of transient, spontaneously resolving complete AV block have been reported during post-marketing use of fingolimod 0.5 mg. Therefore, guidance on the monitoring of patients taking their first dose or re-initiating treatment after interruption of treatment is provided.The on-site first-dose administration monitoring is mandatory for the following patients:\uf0b7At the Baseline visit, in all patients enrolling into this trial from blinded controlled trials and patients from open-label controlled trials coming off the comparator arm.\uf0b7Patients who are off fingolimod treatment for the following durations:\uf0b7The treatment lasted for 14 days or less and was interrupted for 1 day or more, or\uf0b7The treatment lasted for more than 14 days and less than 29 days and was interrupted for more than 7 consecutive days, or\uf0b7The treatment lasted for 4 weeks or more and was interrupted for more than 14 consecutive days.If applicable, the independent first-dose monitoring physician is responsible for monitoring following the 1st intake of the study drug and management of bradycardia symptoms should these occur. He/she must review vital signs during 6-hour monitoring, post-dose ECG and assess discharge criteria at 6 hours post-dose. Baseline or pre-dose ECG should be provided by the site and be available for comparison to the post-dose ECG in order to determine if discharge criteria are met. The pre-dose ECG will help detect potential risk factors, in particular atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction and rhythm disorders. The 6-hour ECG will help detect otherwise asymptomatic electrocardiographic events (specifically conduction delays) prior to discharging the patient from the clinic.Sitting heart rate and blood pressure should be measured prior to the 1st dose of the study drug and every hour for at least 6 hours thereafter.   If required, this would be performed by the independent first-dose monitoring physician. When obtaining the pre-dose heart rate prior to the 1st dose intake, the patient should be allowed to rest sitting for 5 minutes. Then the sitting Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 76\nAmended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 Clean\nProtocol No. CFTY720D2399\nheart rate should be taken. The sitting heart rate and blood pressure measurements should be \ncollected three times to produce three baseline readings for both heart rate and blood pressure \n(prior to the 1st dose of the study drug only). For comparison to the post-dose heart rate values, \nthe lowest pre-dose value of heart rate should be used. \nPatients should receive the first dose of the study drug in the outpatient setting and at a time \nwhich will allow for the required 6-hour post-dose monitoring as well as additional \nmonitoring beyond that time point, if necessary.\nAfter 6 hours monitoring, patients may be discharged if all of the following discharge criteria \nare met:\n\uf0b7\nPulse rate at discharge must be at least 45 bpm\n\uf0b7\nPulse rate at discharge must not be the lowest hourly value measured during the \nobservation period (suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart is \nnot yet manifest)\n\uf0b7\nPatients must have no symptoms associated with decreased pulse rate or rhythm \nabnormalities\n\uf0b7\nECG at 6 hours should not show any significant abnormalities  (e.g. second-degree or \nthird-degree AV block, QTc \u2265 500 ms) \nShould post-dose bradyarrhythmia-related symptoms occur, the patient should be monitored \nuntil the symptoms have resolved.

If systolic BP \u2265140 and/or diastolic BP \u226590 mmHg values are confirmed in two sitting readings out of three in the second visit, the patient should be referred to his primary care physician, an independent internist or to the specialty hypertension clinic for evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.Patients with BP values of >160/100 mmHg on any visit during the study should be immediately referred as above for evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Newly diagnosed hypertension as well as an aggravation of a preexisting condition must be reported as an AE and discontinuation of the study drug may be considered by the investigator.Guidance on monitoring of patients with elevated liver function testsFor detailed guidance on handling specific laboratory or AE pattern, refer to Appendix 6.For any unscheduled laboratory assessments performed locally, an identical sample should also be sent to the central laboratory (Study Part One only) for analysis and capture in the central database. An interruption or discontinuation of the study drug should be clearly documented and reflected on Dosage Administration Record eCRF.  AE/SAEs need to be filed as appropriate.Guidance on monitoring of patients with notable lymphopenia Fingolimod results in sequestration of a proportion of the circulating lymphocytes in lymph nodes with resultant reduction in circulating lymphocyte counts. Average circulating lymphocytes counts are expected to be around 0.5-0.6 x109 /L or 500-600 cells/mm3.  As such, the absolute total WBC, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts will be measured at each visit y. If the absolute lymphocyte count drops below 0.2x109/L or 200 cells/mm3 lymphocyte counts should be repeated regularly, at least monthly, and the patient should be reminded of the risk of infections and instructed to promptly report any symptoms of infections to the investigator.If monthly site visits create a logistical burden for the patient, local lymphocyte testing can be performed, with an eCRF comment added that lymphocyte counts were obtained locally and reviewed by the investigator. Study drug should be temporarily interrupted at the discretion of the investigator. Recovery of lymphocyte counts is expected to take approximately 1-2 months after stopping study drug given the long half-life of fingolimod. The patient should be evaluated and monitored for infections on a regular basis during this period.Guidance on monitoring of patients with symptoms of neurologicaldeterioration, inconsistent with MS courseShould a patient develop any manifestations that, in opinion of the investigator, are atypical for multiple sclerosis including unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptom/signs (e.g. Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 79\nAmended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 Clean\nProtocol No. CFTY720D2399\nrapid cognitive decline, behavioral changes, cortical visual disturbances or any other \nneurological cortical symptoms/sign), or any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase of \nintracranial pressure or accelerated neurological deterioration, the investigator should \nschedule a complete physical and neurological examination and an MRI as soon as possible \nand before beginning any steroid treatment. Conventional MRI as defined in the protocol as \nwell as Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) and Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) \nsequences are recommended for differential diagnosis of Posterior reversible encephalopathy \nsyndrome. The MRI must be evaluated by the local neuroradiologist. The investigator will \ncontact the Medical Advisor at Novartis to discuss findings and diagnostic possibilities as \nsoon as possible. AE/SAEs need to be filed as appropriate.\nIn case of new findings in the MRI images in comparison with the previous available MRI \nwhich are not compatible with MS lesions, the study drug may be discontinued and other \ndiagnostic evaluations need to be performed at the discretion of the investigator. In case of \npresence of new hyperintense T2-weighted lesions in the MRI which may be infectious in \norigin it is recommended to collect a cerebrospinal fluid sample if indicated. Analysis of the \nCSF sample including cellular, biochemical and, microbiological analysis (e.g. herpes virus, \nJC virus), to confirm/exclude an infection (e.g. PML) should be performed. In the event of \nsuspected CNS infection, a CSF aliquot should be sent to a central laboratory (designated by \nthe sponsor) for confirmatory testing.\nOnly when the differential diagnosis evaluations have excluded other possible diagnosis than \nMS and after discussion with the Medical Advisor at Novartis, the study drug may be \nrestarted.\nGuidance on monitoring of patients with infections\nAll infections that develop during the study will be reported as AEs. Investigators are \nrequested to specifically ask about infections at each visit. Treatment and additional \nevaluations will be performed at discretion of the investigator. \nThe investigator should be vigilant for risk of infections including opportunistic infections \n(with bacterial (e.g. atypical mycobacteria), viral (e.g. HSV, VZV, JCV), or fungal (e.g. \ncryptococcus agents), should remind the patient of the risk of infections, and instruct them to \npromptly report any symptoms of infections to the investigator. The patients must also be \nreminded to always carry their Patient Information Card (with site contact information and \nwhich identifies them as participants in a clinical study with an investigational agent with \npotential immunosuppressive effects) and to show this to any local healthcare provider they \nmay consult and ask that the investigator be contacted. \nWhen evaluating a patient with a suspected infection, the most sensitive tests available should \nbe used (i.e. that directly detect the pathogen, as with PCR). \nThe investigator should consider early treatment with antimicrobial therapy on the basis of \nclinical diagnosis or suspicion thereof (e.g. antiviral treatment for herpes simplex or zoster) in \nconsultation with infectious disease experts, as appropriate. \nInvestigators should be aware that in the post marketing setting with Gilenya, isolated cases of \ncryptococcal meningitis have been reported. Patients reporting symptoms and signs (such as, \nNovartis\nConfidential\nPage 80\nAmended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 Clean\nProtocol No. CFTY720D2399\nbut not limited to, headache accompanied with stuff neck, sensitivity to light, fever, confusion, \ntiredness, body aches, chills, vomiting, and/or nausea) consistent with meningitis should \nundergo prompt diagnostic evaluation. If cryptococcal meningitis is diagnosed, appropriate \ntreatment should be initiated as soon as possible. The investigator should inform the Novartis \nmedical expert of any such cases.\nInvestigators should consider the added immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroid therapy \nfor treatment of MS attack/relapse and increase vigilance regarding infections during such \ntherapy and in the weeks following administration.\nProfiling of infection risk in study patients based on anti-viral IgG antibody test results\nAs a conservative measure before initiation of any immune-modulating drug, patients without \na history of chickenpox or without vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV) should be \ntested for antibodies to VZV. VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients should be \nconsidered prior to commencing treatment with fingolimod, following which initiation of \nstudy drug should be postponed for at least 1 month to allow full effect of vaccination to \noccur.\nSerology testing for antibody status of varicella zoster virus (VZV) is performed in the study \nto profile infection risk in study patients. The investigator should inform the patients of their \nimmune status based on these serology results and of the potential risks of primary infections \nor viral reactivation while taking study drug.\nA positive IgG antibody test result does not indicate active infection per se, but only evidence \nof exposure to viral antigens via past infection or vaccination. These patients may, however, \nbe at risk for viral reactivation, which may manifest as VZV virus IgG positive: Shingles.\nThe investigator should instruct the patient to be alert to and report any symptoms or signs \nsuggestive of shingles, so that appropriate antiviral treatment can be initiated in consultation \nwith a local infectious disease expert (if needed). \nIt is also important to ask the patient to report if they are exposed to anyone who has recently \nreceived a live or live attenuated vaccine and manifested a skin rash after the vaccination so \nthat it can be decided, in consultation with an infectious disease expert, if antiviral therapy is \nwarranted. \nIt should be noted that live or live attenuated vaccines should be avoided while patients are \ntaking study drug and for 2 months after study drug discontinuation. Vigilance for infection \nshould be continued throughout this time period. Following VZV vaccination, the initiation \nof study drug should be postponed for 1 month to allow full effect of vaccination to occur.\nVaccination may be less effective during and for up to two months after treatment with \nfingolimod. \nNovartisConfidentialPage 81Amended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 CleanProtocol No. CFTY720D2399",

        "chunk_text": "Fingolimod has previously been associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of macular edema in renal transplant patients receiving cyclosporine. Macular edema occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg/day. Approximately 75% of cases occurred within the first 3-4 months of therapy. The macular edema generally improved or resolved spontaneously after drug discontinuation.An ophthalmic examination by an ophthalmologist or neurologist will be conducted in accordance with Table 6-1 and 6-2. Similar assessments must be performed at an unscheduled ophthalmology visit for any patient who presents with new visual symptoms or decrease in visual acuity. 1. The ophthalmic examinations will consist of best corrected visual acuity using a visual acuity chart with equal spacing between letters and between lines. If patients report visual disturbances at any time while on therapy, evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, should be carried out by an ophthalmologist.2. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scan should be performed if considered clinically indicated. OCT is required for patients transferring into this trial from a blinded study with a comparator arm at the Month 3 and Month 6 visits and in patients transferring from the control arm of open-label controlled studies.  The OCT will be done to evaluate the presence of any abnormalities consistent with macular edema. Guidance on monitoring patients for possible macular edemaWhen macular edema is suspected, a complete ophthalmic evaluation should be performed including, but not limited to, best-corrected visual acuity, dilated ophthalmoscopy, fundus examination and OCT. Patients with history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of macular edema and may require more frequent ophthalmic evaluations, per investigator\u2019s discretion.Based on ophthalmic monitoring during the study, study drug must be interrupted in any patient who meets one of the following criteria:\uf0b7Patient who is diagnosed to have macular edema.\uf0b7Patient who has a decrease in visual acuity (2 line or greater loss on low or normal contrast chart) and an abnormal OCT (> 20% increase in central foveal thicknesscompared to baseline OCT or cystic changes in the fovea).A fluorescein angiogram is recommended to evaluate for the presence of vascular leakage in these patients and patients must be encouraged to stay in the study to track resolution of these changes during subsequent visits.  These patients should be followed-up 1 month and 3 months after diagnosis of macular edema and more frequently, if needed, based on the investigator\u2019s judgment. Further ophthalmologicevaluations will be conducted until such time as resolution is confirmed or no further improvement is expected by the ophthalmologist (based on a follow-up period of not less than 3 months). These evaluations will include repeat best-corrected visual acuity, fundus examination and OCT. Fluorescein angiography (FA) is repeated at the discretion of the Novartis\nConfidential\nPage 84\nAmended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 Clean\nProtocol No. CFTY720D2399\nophthalmologist. If the patient does not show definite signs of improvement on examination \nby specialist testing (e.g. OCT, FA) after 6-8 weeks after discontinuation of study drug, then \ntherapy for macular edema in conjunction with an ophthalmologist experienced in the \nmanagement of this condition should be initiated.\nContinuation of fingolimod in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated. A \ndecision on whether or not study drug should be re-initiated after resolution of macular edema \nneeds to take into consideration the potential benefits and risks to the individual patient.\nAn interruption or discontinuation of the study drug should be clearly documented and \nreflected on Dosage Administration Record eCRF. AE/SAEs need to be filed as appropriate.  \nFor patients discontinuing study drug for any of the above ophthalmic reasons, copies of the \ncolored OCT and fluorescein angiography (if performed) as well as source documents of \nophthalmic examination should be kept at the site as source documents. These documents may \nneed to be submitted for review by an independent panel, if needed. \nGuidance on monitoring patients with uveitis\nPatients with a history of uveitis or findings compatible with active uveitis at baseline can \nenter the study given that there is no evidence of macular edema in the baseline ophthalmic \nexamination.\nIn order to specifically assess the risk of macular edema in the MS population with co-\nexisting uveitis, each patient with findings in any ophthalmic examination compatible with \nactive uveitis (e.g., significant anterior chamber cell or flare, vitreous cell or flare, pars \nplanitis, vasculitis, chorioretinitis) under the discretion of the investigator should undergo an \nophthalmic examination. It is the discretion of the investigator to determine the frequency of \nthese ophthalmic examinations. Adjustments to the schedule can be made to align these \nevaluations with other planned study visits. \nThe diagnosis of macular edema will lead to study drug interruption (refer to Guidance for \nmonitoring of patients with macular edema above).\nNovartisConfidentialPage 85Amended Protocol Version 11 \u2013 CleanProtocol No. CFTY720D2399",
