        "Title": "Overview of Study Design",
        "Content": " As a consequence of clinical and post-marketing experience across indications, in both adult and paediatric populations and with similar products, current U.S. product labeling for etanercept, a Tumor necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitor, includes a black box warning addressing the risk of serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis and bacterial sepsis. Due to the mechanism of action, TNF blockade, and the role of TNF in normal immune and inflammatory response function, it is not surprising that the potential for an increased risk for opportunistic and/or serious infections is an ongoing safety concern. In addition, the activity of TNF in preclinical models and potentially in humans raises the possibility that inhibition of this cytokine might potentiate the clinical risk of malignancy; however, clinical data regarding the risk of both lymphomas and solid tumors associated with the use of etanercept and related compounds have been inconsistent. The interpretation of malignancy risk is complicated by the fact that patients treated with etanercept (and other TNF inhibitors) may have an inherent predisposition to malignancy based upon their underlying disease and often receive other medications concomitantly, such as cyclophosphamide, that independently increase the risk of malignancy.  Following a positive recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in November 2008, on 22 December 2008 the European Commission extended marketing authorisation of the use of etanercept for treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents (8-17 years of age) who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. In August 2011, Commission approval was received for expansion of the paediatric plaque psoriasis indication to include patients from the age of 6 years. This Registry, a multi-centre, long-term, prospective, observational study, is intended to provide information regarding the long-term safety of etanercept use in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis, as well as information regarding the use of etanercept in routine clinical practice for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. This Registry constitutes a post-authorization safety study (PASS) and a condition of marketing authorization, to be conducted in compliance with Volume 9a of The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union (Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance of Medical Products for Human Use). To ensure the quality and integrity of the research, the registry will be conducted under the Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices issued by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology [1].  Note: Italics indicate that they were taken from the original protocol. Further details regarding the background and rationale of the Registry can be found in the full registry protocol.

The primary inclusion criteria are age \u2264 17 at time of administration of the first dose of etanercept, diagnosis with plaque psoriasis by a dermatologist and a decision made to treat with etanercept prior to enrolment.  Patients with a previous history of malignancy, prior treatment with a biologic agent other than etanercept are excluded.  The total duration of the registry is approximately 9 years, including 4 years for patient enrolment and 5 additional years to complete follow-up on all enrolled patients. PURPOSE SAP  Protocol # B1801035 Version 5.0 dated 12Feb2019   Page 11 of 24  Any patient who receives at least one dose of etanercept will be included in the evaluation for safety.  The primary focus of this Registry is safety; however, to the extent possible effectiveness (or lack of effectiveness) will be inferred from patterns of treatment and re-treatment.  In addition, the change of severity of plaque psoriasis as a measure of effectiveness will also be assessed, if these data are available among the majority of patients. Primary analyses will be limited to prospective data, i.e., events reported during participation in the registry.  Serious and pre-specified opportunistic infections and malignancies reported as part of retrospective data collection will be included in a summary of medical history and co-morbid conditions.  ",

For the initial course of etanercept, whether the patient completed 24 weeks of treatment is recorded (yes/no), and if no, the number of weeks of treatment will be reported.  Completion of initial 24 weeks of etanercept is defined as starting the first dose of etanercept within 30 day before the enrolment date or any time after enrolment date, and continuing for at least 168 days.

It should also be noted the study is descriptive only (i.e., non-comparative) and therefore not designed to assess differences amongst etanercept users or users of other therapies.  Current available data are insufficient to project population-based estimates of paediatric patients with severe psoriasis treated with conventional systemic therapy who were not well-controlled and would warrant further intervention such as that potentially afforded by etanercept.  The best research estimates suggest that during the first 3 years following market authorization for treatment of severe disease in patients aged 8 through 17, approximately 250 patients will be treated with etanercept throughout Europe.  Long-term follow-up studies, with a young and potentially highly mobile population and widely-spaced follow-up timepoints (Years 3 \u2013 5), may incur a higher rate of loss-to-follow-up.  The Registry will target 100 to 200 patients. ",

All information already collected as part of the Registry will be retained for analysis.  Several attempts will be made to contact patients and to limit missing data. In general, there will be no imputation of missing data.  Data will be presented and summarized as they were recorded. However, in estimating the person-time at risk for inclusion in the sum of current/recent etanercept use, missing start or stop date of adverse events or etanercept treatment will be handled as follows:   (1) If the day element of the start date of the most recent period of etanercept exposure is missing, it will be assumed to be the 15th of the month.   (2) If the day element of the start date of a serious/pre-specified opportunistic infection or other SAE is missing, it will be assumed to be the 15th of the month. (3) If the last dose of the most recent period of etanercept exposure prior to onset of a serious/pre-specified opportunistic infection or other SAE is recorded as unknown, the reporter is asked to indicate whether it was known to be within the 28 days prior to event onset. The time at risk will be estimated to be the larger of the following: (a) time between the start date of the most recent period of etanercept exposure prior to the onset of AE and the AE onset date, and (b) 29 or (1 + 28) days.  (4) If the month element of the event or treatment are missing, it will be assumed to be the mid of the year, i.e., July 1st.

Overview of Study Design \nAs a consequence of clinical and post-marketing experience across indications, in both adult and \npaediatric populations and with similar products, current U.S. product labeling for etanercept, a \nTumor necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitor, includes a black box warning addressing the risk of \nserious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis and bacterial \nsepsis. Due to the mechanism of action, TNF blockade, and the role of TNF in normal immune \nand inflammatory response function, it is not surprising that the potential for an increased risk \nfor opportunistic and/or serious infections is an ongoing safety concern. In addition, the activity \nof TNF in preclinical models and potentially in humans raises the possibility that inhibition of \nthis cytokine might potentiate the clinical risk of malignancy; however, clinical data regarding \nthe risk of both lymphomas and solid tumors associated with the use of etanercept and related \ncompounds have been inconsistent. The interpretation of malignancy risk is complicated by the \nfact that patients treated with etanercept (and other TNF inhibitors) may have an inherent \npredisposition to malignancy based upon their underlying disease and often receive other \nmedications concomitantly, such as cyclophosphamide, that independently increase the risk of \nmalignancy.  \nFollowing a positive recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human \nUse (CHMP) in November 2008, on 22 December 2008 the European Commission extended \nmarketing authorisation of the use of etanercept for treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis \nin children and adolescents (8-17 years of age) who are inadequately controlled by, or are \nintolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. In August 2011, Commission approval \nwas received for expansion of the paediatric plaque psoriasis indication to include patients from \nthe age of 6 years. This Registry, a multi-centre, long-term, prospective, observational study, is \nintended to provide information regarding the long-term safety of etanercept use in paediatric \npatients with plaque psoriasis, as well as information regarding the use of etanercept in routine \nclinical practice for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. This Registry constitutes a post-\nauthorization safety study (PASS) and a condition of marketing authorization, to be conducted in \ncompliance with Volume 9a of The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union \n(Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance of Medical Products for Human Use). To ensure the quality \nand integrity of the research, the registry will be conducted under the Guidelines for Good \nPharmacoepidemiology Practices issued by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology \n[1].  \nNote: Italics indicate that they were taken from the original protocol. \nFurther details regarding the background and rationale of the Registry can be found in the full \nregistry protocol. \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 10 of 24 \n \n2. Purpose of Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) \nThe purpose of this SAP is to outline the planned analyses to be completed to support the final \nstudy report, interim status and data reports for the purposes of regulatory reporting, and any \npotential publications. Since this is a long-term registry, this SAP may require updates and \nadjustments based on the results and evolving thinking or if deemed necessary by the Registry\u2019s \nScientific Steering Committee (SSC) or the Sponsor following interim data reviews. \nThe following documents were reviewed in preparation of this SAP: \n\u2022 Registry Protocol #0881X1-4654 (Pfizer Protocol # B1801035) (Amendment 6, dated \n01 July 2014) \n\u2022 Case report forms (CRFs) (version 7.0, dated 10 January 2017) for this protocol \n\u2022 International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE)\u2019s Guidelines for Good \nPharmacoepidemiology Practices (2007) \n3. Registry Objectives \nThe objectives of this Registry are to: \n\u2022 Describe the risk of serious and pre-specified opportunistic infection (including \ntuberculosis) associated with current or recent treatment with etanercept in paediatric \nplaque psoriasis;  \n\u2022 Describe the long-term risk of incident malignancy in paediatric plaque psoriasis \npatients who have ever received etanercept;  \n\u2022 Identify any new, serious potentially unrecognized adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by \ncollecting serious adverse event data in this population; and  \n\u2022 Assess effectiveness by describing patterns of treatment with etanercept, including \npremature discontinuation of etanercept and subsequent treatment with systemic \ntherapies (including re-treatment with etanercept). \n \nNote: Italics indicate that they were taken from the protocol. \n4. Study Population \nThe Registry is designed for open enrolment of all patients meeting the selection criteria \ndescribed in the registry protocol, with a recruitment target of 60 to 80 patients in total.  The \nprimary inclusion criteria are age \u2264 17 at time of administration of the first dose of etanercept, \ndiagnosis with plaque psoriasis by a dermatologist and a decision made to treat with etanercept \nprior to enrolment.  Patients with a previous history of malignancy, prior treatment with a \nbiologic agent other than etanercept are excluded.  The total duration of the registry is \napproximately 9 years, including 4 years for patient enrolment and 5 additional years to complete \nfollow-up on all enrolled patients. \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 11 of 24 \n \nAny patient who receives at least one dose of etanercept will be included in the evaluation for \nsafety.  The primary focus of this Registry is safety; however, to the extent possible effectiveness \n(or lack of effectiveness) will be inferred from patterns of treatment and re-treatment.  In \naddition, the change of severity of plaque psoriasis as a measure of effectiveness will also be \nassessed, if these data are available among the majority of patients. \nPrimary analyses will be limited to prospective data, i.e., events reported during participation in \nthe registry.  Serious and pre-specified opportunistic infections and malignancies reported as part \nof retrospective data collection will be included in a summary of medical history and co-morbid \nconditions.  \n5. Variables Used for Analysis \n5.1 \nData Sources \nData will be collected from treating physicians, who will provide information on current \nmedications and status of the Registry patients at enrolment and at each suggested follow-up \nassessment.   \nFollowing enrolment in the registry, the physician will also provide information by retrieving \nmedical record information at his/her own institution and other health care settings, as \nappropriate.  Data will be collected and recorded directly from the patient or their \nparent/guardian only if the patient has been lost to follow-up by the physician.  If any of the \noutcomes of interest are reported directly by patients or their parents/guardians, additional \nattempts to collect supporting information from treating physicians will be made.  In order to \nprovide complete narratives for interim and final study reports, for any reported malignancies, \nany additional information provided via NIS SAE Form AEM01 and other follow-up reports to \nPfizer\u2019s drug safety department or the Endpoint Adjudication Panel will be used to augment the \ndata collected in the CRF. \nBaseline data are expected to be recorded at the time of enrolment to this registry.  Follow-up \ndata are to be collected every 3 months (\u00b1 4 weeks) during the first 2 years, and every 6 months \n(\u00b1 4 weeks) during Year 3 through Year 5 of participation, either at the time of routine clinical \nvisits, or alternatively via telephone interview.  \n5.2 \nDefinition and measurement of outcomes of interest \n5.2.1 Serious and opportunistic infections \nAnalyses will include all episodes of serious infection experienced by a single individual.  \nSerious infections are defined as any infections that: \n\u2022 Are life-threatening or resulting in disability \n\u2022 Require intravenous antibiotic treatment \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 12 of 24 \n \n\u2022 Require hospitalization \n \nSerious infections are also further classified as nosocomial or not nosocomial/unknown. \nSerious infections are characterized by the physician\u2019s open text report of infection site (i.e., \nbodily location), open text report of pathogen, date of diagnosis, date of resolution (or ongoing) \nand most recent dose of etanercept prior to diagnosis.  If date of most recent dose is not known, \nwhether the dose was within 28 days prior to diagnosis is requested (refer to Section 5.3.1 for \nfurther details regarding establishing exposure at the time of infection diagnoses).   \nOpportunistic infections of interest include the following protocol-specified infections and \npathogens (see table below): \nAll infections, including the designation as serious, opportunistic or nosocomial, will be \nreviewed by the Registry\u2019s Endpoint Adjudication Panel prior to inclusion in any analyses. \n \n \n5.2.2 Malignancies \nThe following malignancies are reported as part of the Registry: \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 13 of 24 \n \n\u2022 Solid malignant tumors \n\u2022 Non-melanoma skin cancers \n\u2022 Malignant tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues  \n\u2022 Carcinomas in-situ \nThe malignancy type is specified by open text. In order to meet the case definition for \nmalignancy, a pathology report or a physician\u2019s notation of specific tumor histology will be \nrequired. All malignancies will be evaluated and coded by the Registry\u2019s Endpoint Adjudication \nPanel prior to inclusion in any analyses. \n5.2.3 Other adverse events \nAll other Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and non-serious Adverse Events (AEs) will be \ncollected and coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  All SAEs \nwill be reviewed by the Endpoint Adjudication Panel prior to inclusion in any analyses. \nAs part of the data collection for the Registry, physicians are also asked whether pregnancy \nexposure, lactation exposure, medication error (overdose, or inadvertent or accidental exposure) \nhave occurred. These are to be reported for the purposes of meeting regulatory reporting \nrequirements but are not part of the objectives of the Registry and are not included as part of any \nanalyses. \n5.2.4 Treatment emergent adverse events \nTreatment emergent adverse events will be defined as events having onset date greater or equal \nto the first administration of Enbrel reported in the study. All events with missing start date will \nalso be considered as treatment emergent. \n5.2.5 Effectiveness \nTo the extent possible effectiveness (or lack of effectiveness) will be inferred from patterns of \ntreatment and re-treatment.  The recommended course of etanercept treatment for paediatric \npsoriasis is for up to 24 weeks; physicians should consider discontinuation of etanercept if a \nsatisfactory response is not achieved by 12 weeks.  \nThe following data will be used to evaluate effectiveness:  \n\u2022 Whether a patient receives initial course of etanercept for less than 24 weeks and reason \nfor discontinuation is not recorded as \u201cclearing of psoriasis\u201d \n\u2022 Whether a patient is required subsequent treatment periods of etanercept or other \nsystemic therapies after completion of initial course \n\u2022 Whether a patient receives subsequent treatment periods of etanercept for less than 24 \nweeks \n\u2022 Whether a patient has decreased disease severity after treatment with etanercept \ncompared to baseline \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 14 of 24 \n \nNote: Treatment for individual patients may not follow recommendations included in the product \nlabeling, e.g., treatment with etanercept may be reported as continuous and as longer than 24 \nweeks initially, rather than being reported as discrete treatment periods.  Any deviations from the \nplanned analyses will be described in the interim and/or final study reports, as applicable.  \n5.3  Definition and measurement of exposure/risk windows \n5.3.1 Etanercept \nTREATMENT PERIODS (INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT) \nIt is anticipated that the etanercept treatment status for each patient will change throughout \nfollow-up.  A standard course of etanercept treatment is expected to last up to 24 weeks.  Patients \nsuccessfully responding to the first etanercept treatment course may be exposed to subsequent \ntreatment (i.e., when patients experience a disease flare) and time window between 2 (or more) \nconsecutive courses of treatment may vary substantially.  \nFor the initial course of etanercept, whether the patient completed 24 weeks of treatment is \nrecorded (yes/no), and if no, the number of weeks of treatment will be reported.  Completion of \ninitial 24 weeks of etanercept is defined as starting the first dose of etanercept within 30 day \nbefore the enrolment date or any time after enrolment date, and continuing for at least 168 days. \nFor each subsequent treatment period of etanercept, start and stop dates of treatment are \ncollected. For all subsequent periods, the duration of treatment in weeks will be calculated. \nCumulative exposure will be calculated by the sum, for each etanercept treatment period, of:  \n[last dose date \u2013 first dose date] + 28.  If there are less than 28 days between treatment periods, \nexposure will be considered uninterrupted (i.e., part of the same treatment period). \nCURRENT/RECENT TREATMENT VERSUS PAST TREATMENT \nIn order to interpret reported events, time at risk of occurrence is established based on current or \nrecent (within 28 days) exposure and past exposure.  \nPast exposure is defined as any exposure to etanercept, at any dose, with no reported exposure \nwithin the last 28 days.  \nCurrent/recent exposure is defined as on active etanercept treatment at the time of the event, or \nlast dose of treatment within 28 days (inclusive) preceding the event. \n5.3.2 Other immunosuppressants and concomitant medications \nTreating physicians are asked to report information regarding use of medications, including \nalternative treatments for psoriasis, or other immunosuppressant and immune-modulator \nmedications, including: \n\u2022 Type of treatment or medication name \n\u2022 Status of exposure to medication (i.e., current or past) \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 15 of 24 \n \n\u2022 Dose and duration of exposure \n\u2022 Indication for use \n In addition, when an opportunistic or other serious infection is reported, current/recent treatment \n(i.e., within 28 days) with any immunosuppressant or steroid will be evaluated. \n5.4 \nDefinition and measurement of covariates \nA critical element of understanding the potential association of adverse outcomes with etanercept \nproduct exposure is the inclusion of appropriate covariates in the analyses.  In order to better \ncharacterize the patients who experience or do not experience the events of interest, the \nfollowing additional patient characteristics and exposures with the potential to affect clinical \noutcomes or interpretation of the data are collected at baseline: \nDemography: \n\u2022 Age  \n\u2022 Gender \n\u2022 Race/ethnicity \n \nRelated to plaque psoriasis: \n\u2022 Duration of disease at baseline  \n\u2022 Severity of plaque psoriasis (none, mild, moderate, severe) \n\u2022 Diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis \n\u2022 Previous (or current) use of common plaque psoriasis therapies (topical or systemic) \n\u2022 Response to previous or current therapies (none, poor, fair, good, excellent/complete, \nunknown) \n \nOther covariates: \n\u2022 Medical history and co-morbid conditions \n\u2022 Other concomitant medications \n \nCurrent plaque psoriasis disease severity, co-morbidities and all medication exposures are also \ncollected/updated at each follow-up time point. \n6. General Considerations for Analysis \n6.1 \nAnalysis software and coding \nAll AE verbatim terms will be recorded and coded using MedDRA.  \nAll computations and generation of tables, listings and data for figures will be performed using \nStatistical Analysis Software (SAS)\u00ae version 9.2 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).  \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 16 of 24 \n \n6.2 \nSample size \nNo formal sample size calculation was performed in the design of the Registry since the goal is \nto obtain participation by all eligible patients.  It should also be noted the study is descriptive \nonly (i.e., non-comparative) and therefore not designed to assess differences amongst etanercept \nusers or users of other therapies.  Current available data are insufficient to project population-\nbased estimates of paediatric patients with severe psoriasis treated with conventional systemic \ntherapy who were not well-controlled and would warrant further intervention such as that \npotentially afforded by etanercept.  \nThe best research estimates suggest that during the first 3 years following market authorization \nfor treatment of severe disease in patients aged 8 through 17, approximately 250 patients will be \ntreated with etanercept throughout Europe.  Long-term follow-up studies, with a young and \npotentially highly mobile population and widely-spaced follow-up timepoints (Years 3 \u2013 5), may \nincur a higher rate of loss-to-follow-up.  The Registry will target 100 to 200 patients. \n6.3 \nMethods for withdrawals, missing data, and outliers \nPatients may withdraw consent at any time. If a patient withdraws prior to completing the \nRegistry follow-up period, any reason for withdrawal is to be documented.  All information \nalready collected as part of the Registry will be retained for analysis.  \nSeveral attempts will be made to contact patients and to limit missing data. In general, there will \nbe no imputation of missing data.  Data will be presented and summarized as they were recorded. \nHowever, in estimating the person-time at risk for inclusion in the sum of current/recent \netanercept use, missing start or stop date of adverse events or etanercept treatment will be \nhandled as follows:   \n(1) If the day element of the start date of the most recent period of etanercept exposure is \nmissing, it will be assumed to be the 15th of the month.   \n(2) If the day element of the start date of a serious/pre-specified opportunistic infection or other \nSAE is missing, it will be assumed to be the 15th of the month. \n(3) If the last dose of the most recent period of etanercept exposure prior to onset of a \nserious/pre-specified opportunistic infection or other SAE is recorded as unknown, the reporter is \nasked to indicate whether it was known to be within the 28 days prior to event onset. The time at \nrisk will be estimated to be the larger of the following: (a) time between the start date of the most \nrecent period of etanercept exposure prior to the onset of AE and the AE onset date, and (b) 29 or \n(1 + 28) days.  \n(4) If the month element of the event or treatment are missing, it will be assumed to be the mid \nof the year, i.e., July 1st.  \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 17 of 24 \n \nThe number of missing start or stop date of adverse events or etanercept will be examined, and \nits impact on analysis will be assessed at the time of analysis. Every effort will be made to query \nand resolve any missing data.  Additional sensitivity analysis may be performed if deemed \nnecessary. \n6.4 \nPopulations for analysis \nThe population for analysis includes all enrolled patients who are documented as having received \nat least one dose of etanercept.  No internal comparator group is included in the Registry; \nhowever, where applicable, external data sources  such as geographically appropriate (country-\nspecific) population-based incidence rates (age and gender-specific) of malignancy and \ntuberculosis (TB)  may be used to generate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to aid \ninterpretation of incidence rates of malignancies and tuberculosis estimated based on data from \nthe registry. Due to the small sample size and expected rarity of the events, this approach may be \nof limited value. \n6.5 \nPlanned subgroups \nDescriptive analyses will be stratified, where specified, by: \n\u2022 Enrollment type: Prospective (i.e., patients who started etanercept within 30 days before \nthe enrollment date or any time after enrollment date) or retrospective \n\u2022 Treatment period (initial 24 weeks/post 24 weeks/all follow-up) \n\u2022 Completion of initial 24 weeks of etanercept exposure (yes/no/unknown) \n \nAnalysis of outcomes of interest: \n\u2022 Etanercept exposure status (current/recent or past) \n\u2022 Infection status (none during follow-up/in association with recent or current exposure/in \nassociation with past exposure) \n6.6 \nDerivations \nThe following derived/calculated values will be used: \n\u2022 Age at enrollment in years: [date of enrollment \u2013 date of birth+1]/365.25 \n\u2022 Duration of disease at enrollment in years: [date of enrollment \u2013 date of \ndiagnosis+1]/365.25 \n\u2022 Cumulative exposure in weeks by the duration of chronic exposure for each period of \netanercept exposure: [(last dose date \u2013 first dose date+1) + 28]/7.  A treatment period is \ndefined as continuous treatment with no interruptions of more than 28 days. Restarting \ntreatment within 28 days is considered as having continuous exposure \n\u2022 Duration of each etanercept treatment period  (in weeks): (last dose date \u2013 first dose \ndate+1)/7 \n\u2022 Time at risk of malignancy (in years): [date of malignancy diagnosis or end of follow-up \nif no malignancy is found \u2013 initial treatment dose date+1]/365.25 \nPURPOSE SAP  \nProtocol # B1801035 \nVersion 5.0 dated 12Feb2019 \n \n \nPage 18 of 24 \n \no The follow-up time for patients who had malignancies will be censored at the \ndiagnosis date for each type of malignancy. The follow-up time after diagnosis of \na malignancy will not be included in the calculation of time at risk or not at risk \nfor the same type of malignancy. However, patients who reported a malignancy \nare still at risk of having a different type of malignancy. Malignancy types include \nbut are not limited to: Solid malignant tumors, Non-melanoma skin cancers, \nMalignant tumors of hemopoietic and lymphoid tissues, Carcinoma in-situ. \n\u2022 Time at risk (in years; for the current/recent etanercept-treated group only) of serious or \npre-specified opportunistic infection (excluding malignancies) and other SAEs (excluding \nserious or pre-specified opportunistic infection and malignancies), respectively: \ncumulative period of etanercept exposure defined as the sum of each etanercept treatment \nperiod,  [date of last dose  \u2013 date of first dose +1 + 28]/365.25. \n\u2022 Time not at risk (this applies to time in years accrued after discontinuation of etanercept \nwhile followed in the registry, and excludes malignancies) of serious or pre-specified \nopportunistic infection and other SAEs, respectively: cumulative period without \ncurrent/recent use of etanercept {[(date of study discontinuation) \u2013 (date of last dose + \n28)+1] + [intervals between treatment periods > 28 days]}/365.25.  For analysis purposes, \ntime not at risk is the total study follow-up time minus the time at risk, which is defined \nabove. \n\u2022 Incidence rate is calculated as the number of individual events observed during the time at \nrisk, divided by the total number of patient-years at risk for the event, multiplied by 100. \nPlease note that the time at risk for malignancy will be censored at the diagnosis date of \nthat specific malignancy.  \nIn the example below, all person-time in blue would contribute to the \u2018current/recent\u2019 category, \nwhile all person-time in yellow would contribute to the \u2018past treatment\u2019 category for the \nassessment of SAEs and serious or opportunistic infections.  Patients would be considered at risk \nof malignancies in both the blue and yellow periods. \n \n \nPURPOSE SAP  Protocol # B1801035 Version 5.0 dated 12Feb2019   Page 19 of 24           7.
