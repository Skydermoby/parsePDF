The purpose of the study is to determine the bone strengthening effect of zoledronic acid compared to placebo in osteoporotic children treated with glucocorticoids for Duchenne muscular dystrophy or chronic inflammatory conditions including rheumatic conditions and inflammatory bowel disease. To ensure adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, all children enrolled in this study will be provided with conservative intervention (diet with or without supplements), regardless of their treatment assignment.  The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that 0.05 mg/kg (max 5 mg per dose) zoledronic acid administered every 6 months is superior to placebo for the change in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score at Month 12 relative to baseline. Categorical data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. For continuous data, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be presented. ",

The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted in the MITT population based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, pooled centers, underlying condition treated with glucocorticoids and baseline LS-BMD Z-score as explanatory variables and pooled centers as random effect. The t-test statistic, |d|/SE, will be computed and compared with tdf, 0.975 to determine significance, where d and SE are the estimated treatment difference and the estimated standard error of d from the ANCOVA model, respectively, df is the associated degrees of freedom computed from the error term in the model, and tdf, 0.975 is the 97.5% quantile of the t distribution with df degrees of freedom.  The test and confidence intervals based on this test statistic are robust to the assumptions of normality and of equal variances when within-center treatment group sample size are equal, which is generally the case that treatment allocation is nearly equal within each center because of the manner in which the randomization is carried out. Nevertheless, the underlying assumption of normality and variance homogeneity for the primary analyses will be reviewed and tested by Shapiro\u2019s test and Levene\u2019s test, respectively, prior to unblinding the data.

GFR will be calculated using the Schwartz equation at all visits where serum creatinine will be measured (Visits 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8) by the Central Laboratory. GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) =k[Height (m)]/Serum Creatinine (mg/dL), where k=0.41 Descriptive summary statistics for baseline, each post-baseline visit, and change from baseline to each visit will be presented by laboratory test group and treatment group. Note that if either the baseline or the post-baseline value is missing, then the calculation of change from baseline will also be missing.   Also, shift tables for hematology and serum chemistry will be provided in order to compare a patient\u2019s baseline laboratory evaluation relative to each study visit. For the shift tables, the normal laboratory values will be used to evaluate whether a particular laboratory test value is normal, low, or high for each visit value relative to whether or not the baseline value is normal, low, or high. These summaries will be presented by laboratory test group and treatment group. In addition, a summary table will be presented for the incidence rates of newly occurring clinically notable laboratory abnormalities, where patients will be counted if they have normal or missing baseline value and with at least one post-baseline assessment satisfying the clinically notable criteria. Incidence rates of newly occurring hypocalcaemia (based on central lab) by visit will be summarized similarly for patients who have normal or missing baseline level of serum calcium and clinically notable abnormal serum calcium level at each scheduled post-baseline visit. The definition of clinically notable laboratory abnormalities can be found in Appendix section \u201cClinically notable laboratory values and vital signs\u201d in the protocol. Furthermore, a summary table will be provided for the number and percentage of patients with liver enzyme abnormalities by each study visit and with at least one post-baseline assessment satisfying the liver enzyme abnormalities. Listings of all laboratory parameter measurements will be displayed. In addition, listings of hematology and biochemistry assessments will be provided for patients with newly occurring clinically notable laboratory abnormalities. In these listings, all laboratory values will be ",

In testing this hypothesis, it is assumed Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 21 \nRAP Module 3 \n \nCZOL446H2337/Zoledronic Acid \n \nthat the standard deviations for the two treatment groups is 0.93 under H0 and HA. Based on a \nprimary endpoint of the change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score at 12 months relative to \nbaseline assuming a 0.63 increase in lumbar spine BMD Z-score over 12 months with \nzoledronic acid and no change in the Z-score in the placebo group and a common standard \ndeviation of 0.93, 82 patients are required to show a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD \nZ-score at the 0.05 level with 85% power. Adjusting for a dropout rate of 10%, approximately \n46 patients per treatment group are required. \nThe amount of information from controlled trials in a pediatric GIO population is limited. \nHowever, the 0.63 increase in lumbar spine BMD Z-score is based on the increase observed \nwith pamidronate-treated children on chronic glucocorticoid therapy presented in (Acott et al \n2005). \nThe common standard deviation of 0.93 was estimated from the pamidronate-treated children \nand untreated control evaluated in (Acott et al 2005).
