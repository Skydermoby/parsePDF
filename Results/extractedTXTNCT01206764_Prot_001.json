CRAD001LIC01 Study phase Phase 2 Study title An open-label, multi-center phase 2 study to evaluate everolimus as monotherapy treatment for patients with metastatic recurrent and/or unresectable renal cell carcinoma (EVERMORE) Background Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for more than 200,000 new cases of cancer and over 100,000 cancer deaths annually in the World (Ferlay, et al., 2004).  It is estimated that there were about 15,000 new cases of RCC in the region that excludes the Americas, European Union and Japan. Renal cell carcinomas arise from the proximal tubal epithelium are more common in males than in females with an overall lifetime risk of 1 in 75 and a median age of diagnosis of 65 years.  The past 10 years have seen a dramatic expansion of therapeutic options in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC).  Cytokine-based immunotherapy, the introduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted therapies, such as sorafenib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor temsirolimus have completely changed the treatment paradigm, with another mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (Afinitor\u00ae),  approved in the US and Europe.  Despite this progress, MRCC still remains a fatal disease; therefore, the development of new treatments is needed to help improve the outcome for these patients. Everolimus (Certican\u00ae) has been approved since 2003 in more than  60 countries for the prevention of organ rejection in patients with renal and cardiac transplantation.  Everolimus (RAD001) is a derivative of rapamycin, which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor.  It targets mTOR, a key protein kinase regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival.  The mTOR pathway activity is modulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B AKT (AKT) pathway, a pathway known to be deregulated in numerous human cancers.  RAD001 (Afinitor\u00ae) has been investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act: \uf0b7 directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation; \uf0b7 indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent inhibition of tumor cell hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, VEGF production, and VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells).   The role of angiogenesis in the maintenance of solid tumor growth is well established, and the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the regulation of tumor production of proangiogenic factors as well as modulation of VEGFR signaling in endothelial cells. This activity has recently been confirmed in a Phase 3 study (RECORD-1), which was stopped at its interim analysis by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee for outstanding efficacy observed at the second interim analysis.  The results indicated a significant difference in efficacy between the RAD001 Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 11 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \nInvestigational drug \nRAD001 (everolimus) \nProtocol no. \nCRAD001LIC01 \nStudy phase \nPhase 2 \nStudy title \nAn open-label, multi-center phase 2 study to evaluate everolimus as \nmonotherapy treatment for patients with metastatic recurrent and/or \nunresectable renal cell carcinoma (EVERMORE) \ngroup and placebo group (hazard ratio 0.30 [95% confidence interval (CI): \n0.22, 0.40], p<0.0001).  The progression-free survival (PFS) showed in favor \nof RAD001 with a median PFS of 4.0 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.5) versus  \n1.9 months (CI: 1.8, 1.9) for the placebo group (Motzer, et al, 2008).  The \nprobability of being progression-free at 6 months was 26% (95% CI: 14, 37) \nfor patients receiving RAD001 compared with 2% (CI: 0, 6) for patients in the \nplacebo group. The medium overall survival (OS) had not been reached for \nthe RAD001 group and was 8.8 months (95% CI: 7.9, ASCO2009) for the \nplacebo group.  There was no significant difference between the groups in \nterms of OS (hazard ratio 0.83; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.37; p=0.23) (Motzer et al, \n2008).  Results from a further analysis in the RECORD-1 study, indicated a \nsignificant prolongation in PFS for the RAD001 group compared with the \nplacebo group (hazard ratio 0.33; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.43; p<0.001) (Escudier, et \nal., 2008).  The PFS showed in favor of RAD001 with a median PFS of  \n4.9 months versus 1.87 months for the placebo group.  The median OS was \nnot reached for RAD001, (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.17; p<0.137) \nversus 13 months for the placebo group. RAD0001 is generally well tolerated \nat a dose of 10mg administered daily.  The most frequent adverse events \nassociated with RAD001 therapy (stomatitis, anemia, asthenia, fatigue, rash, \nmucosal inflammation, hypercholesterolemia, and headache) are effectively \nmanaged with drug and non-drug therapies or dietary interventions.  Non-\ninfectious pneumonitis has been reported with mTOR inhibitors but is \ncommonly low-grade and reversible. \nA Phase 2 study reported promising information in 41 metastatic renal cell \ncancer patients (majority were previously-treated with cytokine therapy), who \nwere treated with RAD001, 10 mg orally (po) daily (Amato, et al., 2009).  The \nreported response rate was 32% (12 partial responses [PRs]), the median \ntime to tumor progression was 11.17 months (2.00 months to >31.53 months) \nand OS in 39 patients was 24.17+ months. \nThe intravenous mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus (Torisel), has been reported to \nhave a PFS and OS advantage over interferon (IFN) alpha in Memorial Sloan-\nKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) poor prognosis MRCC patients treated in \nthe first-line setting.  The median survival in the temsirolimus arm was \nprolonged to 10.9 months versus 7.3 months for interferon alpha (p=0.0069).  \nPlanned and post-hoc analyses have been performed to assess the influence \nof tumor histology (clear cell versus others) on survival in patients treated with \ntemsirolimus or IFN (Dutcher, et al., 2007).  The \u201cother\u201d subgroup category \nincluded non-clear cell and indeterminate histologies.  The HR analysis for OS \nsuggested an advantage for temsirolimus over IFN in this sub-group category \n(11.6 months versus 4.3 months, p=0.00095), even if the group analyzed is \nsmall and thus the confidence interval broader. \nIt is clear that novel therapies are needed for patients with advanced RCC, \nincluding those with metastatic disease and those whose tumors are not \namenable to surgical resection.  Although sunitinib and temsirolimus have \nimproved PFS or OS, in comparison with IFN, and the addition of \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 12 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \nInvestigational drug \nRAD001 (everolimus) \nProtocol no. \nCRAD001LIC01 \nStudy phase \nPhase 2 \nStudy title \nAn open-label, multi-center phase 2 study to evaluate everolimus as \nmonotherapy treatment for patients with metastatic recurrent and/or \nunresectable renal cell carcinoma (EVERMORE) \nbevacizumab to IFN has led to improved results in comparison with single-\nagent IFN, in some countries IFN remains the only available treatment option \nfor patients with advanced RCC.  This trial will therefore explore the use of \nonce daily oral RAD001 in patients with advanced kidney cancer of clear and \nnon-clear cell histology and all MSKCC prognosis.  \nPurpose/rationale \nThe purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of RAD001 \n(everolimus), an mTOR inhibitor, as monotherapy in patients with metastatic \ncarcinoma of the kidney who have not received prior systemic treatment, \nother than cytokine therapy.  The proposed dose and schedule (10 mg/day) is \nbased on various Phase 1, Phase 2 studies (monotherapy and combination \ntherapy) in advanced cancers, including RCC, and a large controlled Phase 3 \nstudy (RECORD-1).   \nCurrent standard therapies (chemotherapies and cytokine-based therapies) \nhave produced few and short-lived tumor responses, and are associated with \nsevere toxicities.  The efficacy of RAD001 as monotherapy in patients who \nwere previously treated with cytokine therapy (Amato et al., 2009), and whose \ndisease had progressed on VEGF-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (Motzer et \na., 2008l) were recently reported. \nObjectives \nPrimary:  To evaluate the PFS rate over time. \nSecondary: \n\uf0b7 \nTo evaluate the disease control rate (stable disease [SD] + partial \nresponse [PR] + complete response [CR]); \n\uf0b7 \nTo evaluate the objective response rate (ORR; where ORR = CR + PR) \nand duration; \n\uf0b7 \nTo evaluate Overall Survival (OS) \n\uf0b7 \nTo describe the safety profile of RAD001. \nStudy design \nThis is an open-label, multi-center, single arm Phase 2 study to evaluate the \nsafety and efficacy of RAD001 as monotherapy in patients with any MSKCC \nprognosis metastatic recurrent and/or unresectable clear cell or non-clear cell \ncarcinoma of the kidney.  Patients who have received prior cytokine therapy \nare permitted to participate in the study.   \nPatients will self-administer orally, 10 mg RAD001 per day.  Tumor \nassessments will be performed at 8 weeks to evaluate for inadequate \nresponse (progressive disease [PD]).  The visit at which PD is documented \nwill be deemed the End-of-Treatment Visit.  In the absence of PD, \nassessments will continue every 12 weeks (\u00b11 week) until the start of new \nanticancer therapy and at End-of-Treatment Visit (within 1 week of stopping \ntreatment) or until death.  A partial or complete response warrants \nconfirmation no sooner than 4 weeks. \nFollow-up phase:  All patients will have a follow-up visit scheduled 28 days \nafter the End-of-Treatment Visit to follow for AEs and SAEs that may have \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 13 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \nInvestigational drug \nRAD001 (everolimus) \nProtocol no. \nCRAD001LIC01 \nStudy phase \nPhase 2 \nStudy title \nAn open-label, multi-center phase 2 study to evaluate everolimus as \nmonotherapy treatment for patients with metastatic recurrent and/or \nunresectable renal cell carcinoma (EVERMORE) \noccurred after discontinuation from the study.   \nNo Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is planned. \nPopulation \nAdult patients who have any MSKCC prognosis metastatic recurrent and/or \nunresectable clear cell or non-clear cell carcinoma of the kidney are eligible \nfor enrollment in this study.

                "Title": "Overview of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma",
                "Content": " Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for more than 200,000 new cases of cancer and over 100,000 cancer deaths annually in the World (Ferlay, et al., 2004).  It is estimated that there were about 15,000 new cases of RCC in the region that excludes the Americas, European Union and Japan.  Renal cell carcinomas arise from the tubular epithelium.  Alternatively known as clear-cell cancer or renal adenocarcinoma, RCC is characterized by a distinct clear or granular cell appearance visible by light microscopy (Amato, 2000; George and Kaelin, 2003).  Renal cell carcinoma can occur in different cellular types (Storkel and van den Berg, 1995): \uf0b7 conventional RCC (also known as clear cell) (75% of cases); \uf0b7 RCC of papillary cell type (also known as chromophilic) (10% of cases); \uf0b7 chromophobe cell carcinoma (5% of cases); \uf0b7 Others (10% of cases). The most common molecular abnormality in clear cell RCC is loss of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which is found in about 50%-70% of sporadic cases (Kim and Kaelin, 2004).  Sporadic somatic and hereditary germ cell mutations cause the loss of the VHL protein (Gnarra and Dressler, 1995) and VHL negatively regulates hypoxia inducible genes, such as those encoding hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF 1-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor B and the glucose transporter GLUT-1 (Iliopoulus, et al., 1996).  An animal model of VHL-deficient tumors showed increased uptake of the positron emission tomography tracer fluorodeoxyglucose in an mTOR dependent manner (Thomas, et al., 2006). As with clear cell cancers, papillary tumors originate from the tubular epithelium, but they are morphologically and genetically distinct malignancies.  Multiple genetic abnormalities have been described.  Among 29 malignant papillary RCCs, for example, trisomy 16 was present in 20 tumors, and trisomy 12 and trisomy 20 were each identified in 8 cases (Kovacs, et al., 1989).  No tumor had an abnormality in 3p, which is the typical finding in clear cell carcinomas.  While inherited papillary RCCs have been associated with mutations in the  c-met oncogene, such mutations have not been routinely detected in sporadic cases. Papillary carcinomas have been subdivided into two subtypes, based upon histologic criteria and distinctive gene expression profiles (Delahunt and Eble, 1997).  Type 1 tumors tend to be low-grade and have a better prognosis, while type 2 lesions generally are high-grade and have a poorer prognosis.  An analysis of 130 cases of papillary carcinomas at a median follow-up of 48 months found that patients with type 1 tumors had a significantly better overall and disease-free survival than patients with type 2 tumors (89% and 92% versus 55%  and 44%, respectively; Pignot, et al., 2007).  Approximately 25% of the patients present with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, including locally invasive or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and 50% of the patients Novartis Confidential Page 20 Oncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) Protocol No. CRAD001LIC01   undergoing curative surgery can be expected to experience relapse at distant sites (Figlin, 1999; Linehan, 2001).  Median survival for patients with metastatic disease is about  13 months (Cohen and McGovern, 2005). Renal cell carcinoma is characterized by a high degree of resistance to chemotherapy. Interferon-\u03b1 and interleukin-2 were for many years standard therapies for patients with metastatic RCC (MRCC).  Both achieve complete plus partial responses in 10% to 20% of patients.  Only a minority of patients achieve long-term survival.  Recently developed VEGF targeted therapies, both receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, sorafenib) and VEGF-A ligand antibodies (bevacizumab), have demonstrated activity in clear-cell MRCC (Motzer, et al., 2007; Awada, et al., 2005; Escudier, et al., 2007; Yang, et al., 2003); however, there is limited data regarding their efficacy in papillary RCC. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, temsirolimus, reported both a PFS and overall survival (OS) advantage over interferon alpha in Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) poor prognosis MRCC patients treated in the first-line setting (Hudes, et al., 2006).  This study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS (3.7 months) for patients who received 25 mg intravenous (iv) temsirolimus on a weekly schedule versus 1.9 months for patients who received interferon alpha (p=0.0001).  The median survival in the temsirolimus arm was prolonged to 10.9 months versus 7.3 months for interferon alpha (p=0.0069).  Planned and post-hoc analyses have been performed to assess the influence of tumor histology (clear cell versus others) on survival in patients treated with temsirolimus or interferon (IFN) (Dutcher, et al., 2007).  The \u201cother\u201d subgroup category included non-clear cell and indeterminate histologies.  The HR analysis for OS suggested an advantage for temsirolimus over IFN in this sub-group category (11.6 months versus  4.3 months, p=0.00095), even if the group analyzed was small and thus the confidence interval broader (Dutcher, et al., 2007).  It is clear that novel therapies are needed for patients with advanced RCC, including those with metastatic disease and those whose tumors are not amenable to surgical resection. Although sunitinib and temsirolimus have improved PFS or OS, in comparison with IFN, and the addition of bevacizumab to IFN has led to improved results in comparison with single-agent IFN, in some countries IFN remains as the only available treatment option for patients with advanced RCC.  This trial will therefore explore the use of oral RAD001 daily in both clear cell and non-clear cell carcinoma of the kidney.  ",

                        "Content": " At the cellular and molecular level, RAD001 acts as a signal transduction inhibitor.  RAD001 selectively inhibits mTOR, a key protein kinase present in all cells, which regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival.  mTOR is mainly activated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K) pathway through AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2).  Mutations in these components, or in PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), a negative regulator of PI3K, may result in their dysregulation.  Abnormal functioning of various components of the signaling pathways contributes to the pathophysiology of numerous human cancers.  Various preclinical models have confirmed the role of this pathway in tumor development. The main known functions of mTOR include the following (Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004): \uf0b7 mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors, and energy and nutrient levels, facilitating cell-cycle progression from G1-S phase in appropriate growth conditions; \uf0b7 The PI3K (mTOR) pathway itself is frequently dysregulated in many human cancers, and oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors; \uf0b7 The mTOR pathway is involved in the production of pro-angiogenic factors (i.e., VEGF) and inhibition of endothelial cell growth and proliferation; \uf0b7 Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases (i.e., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates protein translation, including the HIF-1 proteins.  Inhibition of mTOR is expected to lead to decreased expression of HIF-1. ",

                                "Content": " RAD001 inhibits the proliferation of a range of human tumor cell lines in vitro, including lines originating from lung, breast, prostate, colon, melanoma, and glioblastoma.  The  50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranges from sub/low nM to \u03bcM.  RAD001 also inhibits the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro, with particular potency against VEGF-induced proliferation, suggesting that RAD001 may also act as an antiangiogenic agent.  The antiangiogenic activity of RAD001 was confirmed in vivo.  RAD001 selectively inhibited VEGF-dependent angiogenic responses at well tolerated doses.  Mice with primary and metastatic tumors treated with RAD001 showed a significant reduction in blood vessel density when compared with controls. The potential of RAD001 as an anticancer agent was shown in rodent models.  RAD001 is orally bioavailable, residing longer in tumor tissue than in plasma in a subcutaneous (sc) mouse xenograft model, and demonstrating high tumor penetration in a rat pancreatic tumor model.  The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of RAD001 indicates sufficient tumor penetration, Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 22 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \nabove that needed to inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells and tumor cell lines deemed \nsensitive to RAD001 in vitro. \nRAD001 administered daily orally (po) was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth, at well-\ntolerated doses, in 11 different mouse xenograft models (including pancreatic, colon, \nepidermoid, lung, and melanoma) and two syngeneic models (rat pancreatic, mouse orthotopic \nmelanoma).  These models included tumor lines considered sensitive and \u201crelatively resistant\u201d \nin vitro.  In general, RAD001 was better tolerated in mouse xenograft models than standard \ncytotoxic agents (i.e., doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil), while possessing similar antitumor \nactivity.  Additionally, in a VEGF-impregnated sc implant model of angiogenesis, RAD001 \nantiangiogenic activity was demonstrated by reduced vascularity in RAD001-treated tumors \n(murine melanoma). \nIt is not clear which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells to RAD001. \nMolecular analysis has revealed that relative sensitivity to RAD001 in vitro correlates with \nthe degree of phosphorylation (activation) of the AKT/PKB protein kinase and the S6 \nribosomal protein; in some cases (i.e., glioblastoma multiforme) there is also a correlation \nwith PTEN status. \nIn vivo studies investigating the antitumor activity of RAD001 in experimental animal tumor \nmodels showed that RAD001 monotherapy typically reduced tumor cell growth rates rather \nthan regression or stable disease.  These effects occurred within the dose range of 2.5 mg/kg \nto 10 mg/kg, po once a day. \nIn preclinical models, the administration of RAD001 was associated with reduction of protein \nphosphorylation in target proteins downstream of mTOR, notably phosphorylated S6 (p-S6) \nand eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein-1 (p-4E-BP1), and occasionally with an \nincrease in phosphorylation of AKT, a protein upstream of mTOR in the signaling pathway.  \nStudy CRAD001A2107 explored molecular pharmacodynamic (MPD) changes in tumors at \ndifferent doses and schedules of RAD001 (weekly 20, 50, and 70 mg or daily 5 and 10 mg). \nAll significant adverse events (AEs) observed in toxicology studies with RAD001 in mice, \nrats, monkeys, and minipigs were consistent with its anticipated pharmacological action as an \nantiproliferative and immunosuppressant and, at least in part, were reversible after a 2- or  \n4-week recovery period, with the exception of the changes in male reproductive organs, most \nnotably the testes. \nThomas, et al. (2006), have published on the preclinical rationale for using mTOR inhibitors \nin kidney cancer.  Their work showed that HIF mutants rescue growth suppression caused by \ntreatment of CCI-779, a rapamycin prodrug, in mice, and supports that the effect of mTOR \ninhibitors in renal cell carcinoma are mediated primarily via direct effects on tumor cells.  \nHowever, the effect of mTOR inhibitors on the carcinoma\u201fs microenvironment requires \nfurther study.  The mTOR inhibitors have a distinct mechanism of action from the VEGF \npathway inhibitors such as VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib and sorafenib) \nand VEGF ligand antibodies (bevacizumab).  Therefore, resistance to VEGF inhibitors does \nnot imply resistance to mTOR inhibitors. \nNovartis Confidential Page 23 Oncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) Protocol No. CRAD001LIC01   ",

                                "Content": " 1.2.3.1 RAD001 Pharmacokinetics The PK characteristics of RAD001 have been extensively investigated in the context of the drug\u201fs development as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation, where RAD001 was administered twice daily as a part of an immunosuppressant, multi-drug regimen, consistently including cyclosporin A and glucocorticoids.  Recent Phase 1 studies provide steady-state PK for both the weekly and daily schedules at varying dose levels in patients with advanced cancers.  RAD001 is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a median time to peak plasma levels (tmax) of 1-2 hours postdose.  The extent of absorption is estimated at above 11%.  The area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) is dose-proportional over the dose range tested, while maximum blood concentration (Cmax) appears to plateau at dose levels higher than 20 mg.  The terminal half-life in cancer patients averaged 30 hours, which is similar to that in healthy subjects.  Inter-patient variability is moderate with the coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 50%.  A high-fat meal altered the absorption of RAD001 with 1.3 hour delay in tmax, a 60% reduction in Cmax, and a 16% reduction in AUC.  In whole blood, approximately 80% of RAD001 is contained in red blood cells (RBC).  Of the fraction of drug contained in plasma, 74% is protein-bound.  The apparent distribution volume after a single dose was 4.7 L/kg.  RAD001 is eliminated by metabolism, mainly by hydroxylation, then excreted into the feces (>80%). RAD001 is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall.  RAD001 is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp).  Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systematically absorbed RAD001 may be influenced by medicinal products that interact with CYP3A4 and/or P-gp.  In vitro studies showed that RAD001 is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6 substrates, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes.  In two Phase 3 clinical studies in patients following kidney transplantation, strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (azoles, antifungals, cyclosporine, erythromycin) have been shown to reduce the clearance of RAD001, thereby increasing RAD001 blood levels.  Similarly, rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, increases the clearance of RAD001, thereby reducing RAD001 blood levels.  Caution should be exercised when co-administering RAD001 with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Pharmacokinetic drug to drug interactions with cancer agents are being evaluated in ongoing Phase 1b studies.  Based on currently available results, gemcitabine (Study 2101 part 2) and paclitaxel (Study 2104) did not alter RAD001 PK to a clinically relevant extent, whereas imatinib notably increased RAD001 exposure with a mean increase in AUC by a multiple of 3.7 for RAD001 administered weekly and 2-fold for RAD001 administered daily (Study 2206).  Exposure to RAD001 in the presence of letrozole did not exceed that in monotherapy (Study 2108).  Co-administration of RAD001 did not influence the PK of gemcitabine, imatinib, or letrozole.  Exposure to paclitaxel in the presence of RAD001 was slightly decreased (average by 23%). Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 24 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \nRAD001 PK in transplant patients were investigated in special populations, such as patients \nwith hepatic or renal impairment, various ethnic groups, and pediatric renal transplant \npatients.  In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean AUC for RAD001 was \nincreased by 2-fold whilst renal impairment did not affect the PK of RAD001.  Age, weight \n(both over the adult range), and gender did not affect the PK of RAD001 to a clinically \nrelevant extent.  Also, the PK were not altered in Asian patients, whereas black patients had \n21% higher clearance compared with non-blacks. \nA single, escalating-dose study in Japanese subjects did not show a significant difference in \nsystemic exposure relative to the Caucasian population. \n1.2.3.2 \nPharmacodynamic Studies \nPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling based on inhibition in a peripheral biomarker \n(S6 kinase inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) suggests that 5 mg to \n10 mg daily should be an adequate dose to produce a high degree of sustained target \ninhibition. \nFurthermore, MPD studies using immunohistochemistry in biopsied tumor tissue assessed the \ndegree of inhibition and its duration (for p-S6, p-4E-BP1, and p-AKT expression) with daily \nand weekly dosing.  The pathologist was blinded for the biopsy sequence.  There was almost \ncomplete inhibition of p-S6 at all doses and schedules studied (p=0.001).  Preliminary results \nsuggest a dose-related decrease in p-4E-BP1 and increase in p-AKT expression, with maximal \neffect at 10 mg daily and \u226550 mg weekly. \nIn the first part of Study C2101/C2102, the inhibition of S6K1 activity in PBMCs was \nmeasured in patients on a weekly regimen (5, 10, 20, and 30 mg) by radioimmunoassay \n(Lane, et al., 2003).  Subsequently, PK/pharmacodynamic modeling was carried out, \nextrapolating from preclinical findings in order to predict the likely inhibitory effect of \nRAD001 on its known target in the tumor of patients at these doses in the weekly regimen, as \ngiven, at postulated higher weekly doses, and in a postulated daily regimen.  For the weekly \nregimen, the modeling suggested 20 mg/week as a minimum inhibitory dose, but with a \ndecline of inhibition (over 50%) between administrations, which was only marginally \nimproved by increasing the dose.  The model indicated that a greater degree of sustained \ninhibition should be obtained with a daily regimen at comparable total drug consumption. \nA daily regimen of RAD001 (5 mg/day) was associated with a high inhibition of p-S6 and  \np-eIF4G, which was complete at 10 mg daily.  In patients on the weekly schedule, p-S6 \ninhibition was complete and sustained at all dose levels, while that of p-eIF4G was complete \nand sustained at 50 mg weekly, but not at 20 mg weekly.  On both regimens, numerous \npatients demonstrated apparent up-regulation of AKT, which tended not to persevere in the \npatients at 50 mg weekly.  The proliferation index was reduced in most patients, recovering in \nsome of those on the 50 mg weekly regimen.  Please refer to the Investigator\u201fs Brochure (IB) \nfor further details.  \n1.2.3.3 \nPhase 1 Oncology Studies \nData are available from Phase 1 clinical studies of RAD001 given as a single agent to  \n147 patients with advanced solid tumors.  Such studies included various doses and schedules \n(weekly dosing, range 5 mg to 70 mg and daily dosing 5 mg to 10 mg).  Approximately 46% \n",

Porter, et al. (2006), \nreported data from 12 RCC patients enrolled in two Phase 1 studies who received RAD001 on \na weekly or a daily schedule.  Seven patients received doses ranging from \n20 mg to 70 mg po weekly and 5 patients received 10 mg po daily.  Ten of the 12 patients had \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 27 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \nreceived prior treatment (7 patients had received bevacizumab and erlotinib, 2 patients had \nreceived IL-2, and 1 patient received other drugs).  \nThe results of tumor assessments using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \n(RECIST) showed one confirmed and one unconfirmed partial response (PR), the latter \nhaving progressed on bevacizumab therapy.  Overall, 6 patients had stable disease (SD) for  \n\u22656 months and 4 patients were progression-free beyond 12 months (maximum 20 months).  \nTwo of the latter patients had previously received bevacizumab therapy. \nIn a Phase 2 study (Amato, et al., 2006) of RAD001 in patients with MRCC involving no \nmore than 1 prior therapy, an oral daily dose of 10 mg without an interruption (28-day cycle) \nand response rate determined using RECIST criteria with re-assessment every 3 cycles, \nRAD001 had promising anti-tumor activity as demonstrated by a 33% PR rate.  Anti-tumor \nactivity was further suggested by prolonged time to progression (TTP) of \uf0b33 months for 86% \nof patients. The antitumor effect was also demonstrated when RAD001 was used as a second-\nline therapy.   \nIn a second Phase 2 study, RAD001 (10 mg po daily) demonstrated promising anti-tumor \nactivity in 41 previously-treated patients with metastatic RCC.  The reported response rate \nwas 32% (12 PRs), the median TTP was 11.17 months (2.00 months to >31.53 months) and \nOS in 39 patients was >24.17+ months (Amato, et al., 2009). \nThis activity has recently been confirmed in a Phase 3 study, RECORD-1, which was stopped \nat its interim analysis by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee for outstanding efficacy \nobserved at the second interim analysis.  The results indicated a significant difference in \nefficacy between the RAD001 group and placebo group (hazard ratio 0.30 [95% confidence \ninterval (CI): 0.22, 0.40], p<0.0001).  The progression-free survival (PFS) showed in favor of \nRAD001 with a median PFS of 4.0 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.5) versus 1.9 months (CI: 1.8, 1.9) \nfor the placebo group (Motzer, et al, 2007).  The probability of being progression-free at 6 \nmonths was 26% (95% CI: 14, 37) for patients receiving RAD001 compared with 2% (CI: 0, \n6) for patients in the placebo group. The medium OS had not been reached for the RAD001 \ngroup and was 8.8 months (95% CI: 7.9, not available) for the placebo group.  There was no \nsignificant difference between the groups in terms of OS (hazard ratio 0.83; 95% CI: 0.50, \n1.37; p=0.23) (Motzer et al, 2008).  Results from a further analysis in the RECORD-1 study, \nindicated a significant prolongation in PFS for the RAD001 group compared with the placebo \ngroup (hazard ratio 0.33; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.43; p<0.001) (Kay, et al., 2008).  The PFS showed \nin favor of RAD001 with a median PFS of 4.9 months versus 1.87 months for the placebo \ngroup.  The median overall survival was not reached for RAD001, (hazard ratio 0.82;  \n95% CI: 0.57, 1.17; p<0.137) versus 13 months for the placebo group. \nRAD001 (Afinitor) was recently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with \nadvanced renal cell cancer after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib. \nIt is clear that novel therapies are needed for patients with advanced RCC, including those \nwith metastatic disease and those whose tumors are not amenable to surgical resection.  \nAlthough sunitinib (Motzer, et al., 2007) and temsirolimus (Hudes, et al., 2007) have \nimproved PFS or OS, in comparison with IFN, and the addition of bevacizumab to IFN has \nled to improved results in comparison with single-agent IFN (Escudier, et al., 2007), in some \ncountries IFN remains the only available treatment option for patients with advanced RCC.  \nNovartis Confidential Page 28 Oncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) Protocol No. CRAD001LIC01   This trial will therefore explore the use of oral RAD001 daily in clear and non-clear cell advanced kidney cancer.

        "Content": " Current standard therapies (chemotherapies and cytokine-based therapies) have produced few and short-lived tumor responses, and are associated with severe toxicities. It is clear that novel therapies are needed for patients with advanced RCC, including those with metastatic disease and those whose tumors are not amenable to surgical resection.  Although sunitinib and temsirolimus have improved PFS or OS, in comparison with IFN, and the addition of bevacizumab to IFN has led to improved results in comparison with single-agent IFN, in some countries IFN remains the only available treatment option for patients with advanced RCC.    A smaller sub-group analysis of patients with \u201cother\u201d subgroup category (non-clear and indeterminate histologies), the HR analysis for OS suggested an advantage for temsirolimus (an iv mTOR inhibitor) over IFN (Dutcher, at al., 2007).  The oral formulation of RAD001 presents an improvement in the delivery of anticancer therapy, with direct impact on the patient and the health care delivery system.  RAD001 is generally well tolerated at 10 mg daily doses (see Table 1).  Novartis Confidential Page 29 Oncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) Protocol No. CRAD001LIC01   RAD001 has been studied extensively in solid organ transplantation (renal and cardiac) where over 1000 patients have received RAD001 for \u22653 years, with the drug being given as a constituent of an immunosuppressive regimen, which included cyclosporine (a CYP3A4 inhibitor) and glucocorticoids. Pharmacodynamic modeling indicates that downstream effectors of mTOR are completely suppressed by RAD001 at the 10 mg/day.  Preliminary results of MPD studies in biopsied tumor tissue suggest a dose-related decrease in p-4E-BP1 and increase in p-AKT expression, with maximal effect at 10 mg daily. The proposed dose and schedule (10 mg/day) is based on various Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (monotherapy and combination therapy) in advanced cancers, including RCC.  This dose and schedule also showed significant efficacy in a large placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with MRCC who previously progressed on anti-VEGF targeted therapy. The purpose of this open-label, multi-center, Phase 2 study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of RAD001 10 mg po daily dose, as monotherapy, in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the kidney with clear cell and non-clear cell histology and all MSKCC prognosis, who have not received prior systemic treatment other than cytokine therapy.

Tumor assessments will be performed at 8 weeks to evaluate for inadequate response (progressive disease [PD]).  The visit at which PD is documented will be deemed the End-of-Treatment Visit.   In the absence of PD, assessments will continue every 12 weeks (\u00b11 week) until the start of new anticancer therapy and at the End-of-Treatment Visit (within 1 week of stopping treatment) or until death.

Hepatitis B and C Screening In cancer patients with hepatitis B, whether carriers or in chronic state, use of antivirals during anticancer therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of HBV reactivation and associated HBV morbidity and mortality (Loomba et al. 2008; Sorrell et al. 2009). During the screening period, ALL patients must be screened for HBV and HCV (current or past history of infection). Careful medical history must be taken for all patients to look for risk factors (family history of HBV and HCV, intravenous drug abuse, unprotected sex, dialysis, blood transfusions, etc), and any past or present HBV symptoms (e.g., jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, right upper quadrant pain). All patients will be tested for HBV-DNA and serological markers, and HCV viral load by quantitative RNA-PCR. It is highly recommended that patients at risk of HBV reactivation are treated prophylactically with antivirals for 1-2 weeks prior to receiving study drug and for at least 4 weeks after last dose of study drug. The management guidelines, in Section 6.1.4.4, are provided according to the results of the screening assessment of viral load and serological markers for HBV and HCV.

                        "Content": " Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to an AE or abnormal laboratory value suspected to be related to RAD001 must be followed at least weekly until the AE or abnormal laboratory value resolves or returns to grade 1.  If a patient requires a dose delay of >21 days from the intended day of the next scheduled dose, then the patient must be discontinued from the study. 6.1.4.1 Management of Stomatitis/Oral Mucositis/Mouth Ulcers Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to RAD001 should be treated using local supportive care.  Please note that investigators in earlier studies have described the oral toxicities associated with RAD001 as mouth ulcers, rather than mucositis or stomatitis.  If examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than a more general inflammation of the mouth, the AE should be classified as such.  Please follow the paradigm below for the treatment of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers: 1. For mild toxicity (grade 1), conservative measures such as non-alcoholic mouth wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until resolution should be used. 2. For more severe toxicity (grade 2, in which case patients have pain, but are able to maintain adequate oral alimentation, or grade 3, in which case patients cannot maintain adequate oral alimentation), the suggested treatments are topical analgesic mouth treatments (i.e., local anesthetics such as benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase\u00ae). 3. Agents containing hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to worsen mouth ulcers.  It is preferable to avoid these agents. 4. Antifungal agents must be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed.  In particular, systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.) should be avoided in all patients due to their strong inhibition of RAD001 metabolism, leading to higher RAD001 exposures. Therefore, topical antifungal agents are preferred if an infection is diagnosed.  Similarly, antiviral agents such as acyclovir should be avoided unless a viral infection is diagnosed. Note: Stomatitis/oral mucositis should be appropriately graded using the functional grading given on the National Cancer Institute- (NCI) CTC for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. 6.1.4.2 Management of Hyperlipidemia and Hyperglycemia Treatment of hyperlipidemia should take into account the pre-treatment status and dietary habits of the patient.  Blood tests to monitor hyperlipidemia must be taken in the fasting state.  Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L) or grade 2 or higher hypertriglyceridemia (>2.5 x ULN) should be treated with a statin or appropriate lipid-lowering medication, in addition to diet.

The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be \ndetermined for individual patients based on their risk of cardiovascular complications of \nhyperlipidemia. \nGrade 3 hyperglycemia has been observed in patients receiving RAD001 therapy.  In many \ncases in Study RAD001C2222, the affected patients had an abnormal fasting glucose at \nbaseline.  Based on this finding, it is recommended that optimal glucose control be achieved \nbefore starting a patient on RAD001.  Study patients should have their glucose levels \nmonitored during RAD001 therapy. \n6.1.4.3 \nManagement of Non-Infectious Pneumonitis \nBoth asymptomatic radiological changes (grade 1) and symptomatic non-infectious \npneumonitis (grade 2 = not interfering with activities of daily living or grade 3 = interfering \nwith activities of daily living and oxygen indicated) have been noted in patients receiving \nRAD001 therapy.  Non-infectious pneumonitis has been associated with RAD001 and other \nmTOR inhibitors (Atkins, et al., 2004).  \nIn order to monitor for asymptomatic (grade 1) non-infectious pneumonitis, a chest x-ray or \nCT scan is required in addition to the 3-monthly CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \ntumor examinations.  \nAdditional chest x-rays or CT scans may be performed, when clinically necessary.  If non-\ninfectious pneumonitis develops, a consultation with a pulmonologist should be considered.  \nIf the patient develops grade 3 pneumonitis, treatment with RAD001 should be interrupted \nand the patient should be treated as medically indicated (short course corticosteroids, oxygen, \netc.). \nChest x-ray/chest CT scans obtained during the study should be readily accessible at the site \nand must be kept with the patient\u201fs source documents. \nDose modification instructions and Management of non-infectious pneumonitis suspected to \nbe associated with RAD001 and are provided in Table 3 and Table 4. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNovartis Confidential Page 38 Oncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) Protocol No. CRAD001LIC01     ",

During this visit, AE and serious adverse event information occurring since the last dose of study drug will be collected and \nrecorded on the appropriate CRF pages.  All patients who are discontinued from the study drug for any reason will continue to have tumor assessments until the start of any new anticancer therapy. \nu  After discontinuation of the study drug, the investigator or his/her designee will collect information on the initiation of new anticancer therapies given after the last dose of study drug. \nr All patients will be screened for HBV-DNA, HBV serologic markers and HCV RNA-PCR. It is highly recommended that patients positive for HBV-DNA or HBsAg receive prophylactic antivirals for 1-2 \nweeks prior to receiving study drug. The antiviral treatment should continue throughout the entire study period and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Monitoring for HBV reactivation, \naccording to Table 6-5, will only require the measurement of HBV-DNA from Visit 2 onwards. Patients who are HBV-DNA / HBsAg positive at screening will be monitored every cycle. Patients who are \nHBV-DNA and HBsAg negative at screening (and not receiving prophylaxis) but HBsAb or HBcAb positive will be monitored every cycle. Follow-up testing for HCV RNA-PCR will be performed every cycle \nonly if the patient has a history of HCV or is positive at baseline, or both. If there is no history of HCV and HCV RNA-PCR test is negative at baseline, no follow-up testing is required. \n \nNovartis Confidential Page 50 Oncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) Protocol No. CRAD001LIC01   ",

A CT scan or MRI of the chest/abdomen Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 51 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \nand pelvis will be obtained at screening (\u226435 days) prior to the first dose of RAD001 and \nperiodically as indicated in Table 9.  Tumor response will be assessed at  \n8 weeks (\u00b11 week) and every 12 weeks (\u00b11 week) thereafter until determination of disease \nprogression (by the local radiologist) and at the end of the study. \nAll patients who are discontinued from RAD001 for any reason (i.e., documented disease \nprogression by the investigator, an AE or SAE, or administrative reasons, etc.) will continue \nto have tumor assessments until the start of new anticancer therapy. \nAt screening (\u226435 days prior to the first dose of RAD001), all patients must have a CT scan \nwith contrast or MRI with contrast of the chest, abdominal, and pelvic area.  Patients who are \nallergic/sensitive to the radiographic contrast media used in CT scans and MRIs may have a \nCT scan of the chest without contrast and a MRI of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast. \nThe same imaging modality used at screening must be used for all subsequent follow-up \nassessments.  \nUltrasound scans cannot be used to measure tumor lesions. \nAll patients should have at least one measurable disease lesion by CT scan or MRI or by \nphysical exam.  Physical examination findings, such as skin lesions, must be photographed \n(color photography) using a digital camera.  Subcutaneous nodules will be measured with a \ncaliper or a ruler.  If skin lesions are used for assessment of disease, at least one skin lesion \nshould be biopsied to establish the malignant nature of the lesions.  The site must document \non the Tumor Assessment Comments CRF page that a biopsy of at least one skin lesion \nconfirming the presence of metastatic disease has been obtained or was available for this \npurpose. \nMeasurable disease lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the \nlongest diameter \u226520 mm using conventional techniques, or \u226510 mm with spiral CT scan \n(with a minimum lesion size no less than double the slice thickness).  Conventional CT and \nMRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of 7.5 mm or less in slice thickness.  Spiral \nCT should be performed using a 5 mm or less contiguous reconstruction algorithm (this \nspecification applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis). \nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, \nrepresentative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions.  The target lesions \nwill be measured and recorded at baseline and during the course of the study.  The target \nlesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameters) and \nsuitability for accurate repeated measurements.  A sum of the longest diameter for all target \nlesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of the longest diameter. \nIf a very small lesion cannot be reliably measured because of its size, it is recommended to \nenter the minimum lesion size (i.e., 5 mm for spiral CT).  In other cases where the lesion \ncannot be reliably measured for reasons other than its size (i.e., borders of the lesion are \nconfounded by neighboring anatomical structures), no measurement should be entered and the \nlesion cannot be evaluated. \nA target lesion that resolves from baseline must be assigned a size of 0 mm when \ndocumenting on the patient\u201fs RECIST CRF page.  Refer to Supplement 1 for additional target \nand non-target lesion reporting guidelines. \nNovartis Confidential Page 52 Oncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) Protocol No. CRAD001LIC01   Partial response requires at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters.  Complete response requires a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions.  If an initial observation of partial or complete response is made, a confirmation scan is required no sooner than 4 weeks.  In case of an unscheduled or delayed tumor assessment (i.e., to confirm a PR/CR or due to any other reason), subsequent tumor assessments must be performed according to the originally planned scheme from baseline, i.e., every 12 weeks from the time of the second assessment at 8 weeks.  Disease progression is either 1) a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline, or 2) the appearance of a new lesion, or 3) the unequivocal progression of non-target lesions overall.  Patients who had suspected clinical symptoms of disease progression should be immediately evaluated with a physical examination and imaging (CT scan or MRI) assessment for objective evidence of disease progression.

                "Content": " The investigator must fax each SAE or pregnancy (see below) to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence, even if it is not felt to be treatment-related.  Follow-up information about a previously reported SAE must also be faxed to Novartis within 24 hours of receipt.  If the SAE is not documented in the IB (i.e., unexpected), and it is thought to be related to the Novartis investigational drug(s), central IMS may need to contact the investigator urgently in order to obtain further information prior to the submission of the reported event to the health authorities.  If warranted, to fulfill the regulatory requirement, an Investigator Notification may be issued, to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug (or therapy) that this serious unexpected and suspected adverse reaction has been reported.  To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until the patient has stopped study participation must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  Any SAEs experienced by the patient during the follow-up period beginning 4 weeks after study drug has been stopped should only be reported to Novartis if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.  Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow-up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information.  A SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event. The telephone and telefax number of the contact persons in the local department of Clinical Safety and Epidemiology, specific to the site, are listed in the investigator folder provided to each site.  The investigator must complete the SAE Report Form in English, assess the relationship to the Novartis investigational drug(s) and send the completed, signed-off, form by fax within  24 hours to the local Novartis safety office (for trials monitored by Novartis) or to the relevant Contract Research Organization (CRO).  The local Novartis safety office or CRO, after ensuring that the form is accurately and fully completed, must then fax it to the central Novartis IMS Department within 2 to 3 calendar days for deaths or life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days for other SAEs.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the CRFs at the study site.  A copy of the SAE Report Form is forwarded to the monitor by the local Novartis safety office or CRO, to perform source data verification. Follow-up information is always forwarded to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was sent.  A new SAE Report Form should be sent stating that this is a follow-up.  The follow-up should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (in the case of a blinded study), and whether the patient continued or discontinued study participation.  Where a SAE is followed by reports of recurrent episodes, complications or progression of the initial event, all such reports will be treated as follow-up to the original episode.  If a new SAE occurring at a different time interval is considered completely non-associated to a previously reported one, a new SAE Novartis Confidential Page 59 Oncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) Protocol No. CRAD001LIC01   Report Form should be submitted as an initial report.  All forms and fax confirmation sheets must be retained by the study site. If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Novartis study drug, a Clinical Safety and Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting.  Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant Ethics Committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.

        "Content": "  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Quick Reference: Eligibility \uf0b7 Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint.  Measurable disease \u2013 the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.  Measurable lesions \u2013 lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter  \uf0b320 mm using conventional techniques or \uf0b310 mm with spiral CT scan. Non-measurable lesions \u2013 all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter  <20 mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques. \uf0b7 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  \uf0b7 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  \uf0b7 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  Methods of Measurement  \uf0b7 CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols. \uf0b7 Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung; however, CT is preferable.  \uf0b7 When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination. Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 79 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \n\uf0b7 The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been \nfully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment \nand a high level of expertise that may only be available in some sites. Therefore, the \nutilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation \npurposes in specialized sites. However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete \npathological response when biopsies are obtained. \n\uf0b7 Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above the \nupper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical \nresponse when all lesions have disappeared. \n\uf0b7 Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., \nafter treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions \nin tumor types such as germ cell tumors). \nBaseline documentation of \u201cTarget\u201d and \u201cNon-Target\u201d lesions \n\uf0b7 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, \nrepresentative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and  recorded and \nmeasured at baseline.  \n\uf0b7 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) \nand their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or \nclinically).  \n\uf0b7 A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as \nthe baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to \ncharacterize the objective tumor. \n\uf0b7 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should \nalso be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence \nor absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  \nResponse Criteria \nEvaluation of target lesions \n\uf0b7 Complete Response (CR): \nDisappearance of all target lesions. \n\uf0b7 Partial Response (PR): \nAt least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, \ntaking as reference the baseline sum LD. \n\uf0b7 Progressive Disease (PD): \nAt least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, \ntaking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the \ntreatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. \n\uf0b7 Stable Disease (SD): \nNeither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient \nincrease to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum \nLD since the treatment started. \n \n \n \n \n \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 80 \nOncology Clinical Study Protocol (Version No. 01) (AM 1) \nProtocol No. CRAD001LIC01  \n \nEvaluation of non-target lesions \n\uf0b7 Complete Response (CR): \nDisappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of \ntumor marker level. \n\uf0b7 Incomplete Response/         \nStable Disease (SD):  \nPersistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or \nmaintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. \n\uf0b7 Progressive Disease (PD): \nAppearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal \nprogression of existing non-target lesions.*  \n* Although a clear progression of \u201cnon-target\u201d lesions only is exceptional, in such \ncircumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail and the progression status \nshould be confirmed later on by the review panel (or study chair). \nEvaluation of best overall response \nThe best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until \ndisease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded \nsince the treatment started). In general, the patient\u201fs best response assignment will depend on the \nachievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  \n \nTarget Lesions \nNon-Target Lesions \nNew Lesions \nOverall Response \nCR \nCR \nNo \nCR \nCR \nIncomplete \nresponse/SD \nNo \nPR \nPR \nNon-PD \nNo \nPR \nSD \nNon-PD \nNo \nSD \nPD \nAny \nYes or No \nPD \nAny \nPD \nYes or No \nPD \nAny \nAny \nYes \nPD \n \n\uf0b7 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment \nwithout objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having \n\u201csymptomatic deterioration.\u201d Every effort should be made to document the objective \nprogression even after discontinuation of treatment.  \n\uf0b7 In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. \nWhen the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the \nresidual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the CR status. \nConfirmation \n\uf0b7 The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response \nrate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made \nclear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. \n\uf0b7 To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by \nrepeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for \nresponse are first met. Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol may also be \nappropriate.  \n",
