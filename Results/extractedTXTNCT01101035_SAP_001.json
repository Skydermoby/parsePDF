The randomization and dosing \nschema are displayed in Figure 3.a.\nFigure 3.a\nDose Titration Based on sUA Response and By Baseline Renal Function in \nthe First Three Months of the Study\nSerum urate levels will be unblinded to the investigator and Takeda during the first 10 weeks of \nthe study to facilitate dose increases based on sUA response. After the Week 10 Visit, sUA \nmeasurements will be blinded to Takeda and the investigator. The interactive voice-activated \nresponse system/interactive web-activated response system (IVRS/IWRS) will manage the \ntreatment assignment after randomization and throughout the study medication treatment.\nTo maintain the double-blind nature of the study, febuxostat and allopurinol tablets will be \nover-encapsulated and matching placebo capsules will be manufactured which are identical in \nappearance. Subjects will orally self administer 2 capsules each morning in the appropriate \ncombination for their assigned dose and treatment.\nSubjects currently on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) will discontinue treatment at the Day -7\nScreening Visit, and will begin colchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis. Subjects not on \nULT will begin colchicine 0.6 mg QD on the Day 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will \nreceive gout flare prophylaxis for the first six months of the study medication treatment period. \nAlternatively, if colchicine is not tolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they will be \nadministered naproxen 250 mg twice daily with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been \nTMX-67_301\nPage 9 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nmaintained on an appropriate dose (as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump \ninhibitor other than lansoprazole, he/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In \ninstances when subjects should not receive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or prednisone may be provided at the investigator\u2019s \ndiscretion.\nFollowing the Day 1/Randomization Visit, subjects will return for study visits during the first \n3 months of the study based on the subject\u2019s sUA response. Once a subject\u2019s sUA <6.0 mg/dL,\nthere will be no further visits until Month 3.\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a \nWeek 4 and Month 3 visit. If the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed \nstudy medication at Week 4, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit will \noccur at Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the \nsubject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If \nthe Week 6 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8\nand the next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study \nmedication at the Month 3 visit. After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be \nmade. All subjects will have Month 3 and Month 6 visits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the \nstudy. In addition, subjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr <60mL/min) and/or subjects \nwho are elderly (\u226565 years of age) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor liver \nfunction tests. Subjects who are withdrawn from study medication treatment but have not \nwithdrawn consent will be followed via phone calls every 2 months until the end of the study or \nuntil the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE.\nA Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will periodically review results obtained in the study, \nincluding results at 3 planned interim analyses. They will monitor the progress and the on-going \nsafety of subjects enrolled into the study. An Independent CV Endpoints Committee will be \nestablished to prospectively review all suspected CV events using blinded data. A periodic \nreview of all serious adverse events and specific CV adverse event terms will be performed by \nthe Chair of the CV Endpoints Committee. The Chair, not the sponsor, will designate cases for \ncomprehensive review by the CV Endpoints Committee. All investigational sites will be required \nto collect relevant clinical information required for adjudication of all deaths and potential CV \nserious adverse events (SAE).\n",

The hazard ratio(febuxostat versus allopurinol) for the primary safety endpoint will be computed based on febuxostat and allopurinol estimated hazard rates. The febuxostat treatment group will be compared to the allopurinol treatment group to test for non-inferiority in the MACE composite rate using a CPH model with treatment as factor in the model and baseline renal function as a stratification factor. Non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol will be declared (at an interim or at the final analysis) if the current upper 1-sided CI for the hazard ratio calculated with critical values obtained using the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending function, which preserves an overall 1-sided false-rejection rate of 2.5%, is less than 1.3.Kaplan-Meier plot for the time to first occurrence of any event in the adjudicated MACE composite will be produced by treatment group (overall and within the levels of the stratification factor, baseline renal function).A sensitivity analysis on the primary safety endpoint will also be performed by excluding MACE that occur more than 30 days after treatment discontinuation.Assessment of the proportional hazards assumption will be made by inspection of the Kaplan-Meier curves and using plots of Schoenfeld residuals. In the Kaplan-Meier curves, if the proportional hazard assumption is satisfied then the graph of the survival function versus the survival time should result in a graph with parallel curves. In the plots of Schoenfeld residuals, if the proportional hazard assumption is satisfied then the graph of the Schoenfeld residuals obtained from the primary CPH model versus the ordered time of events along with smoothing spline should result in a horizontal line.Alternative methods of analysis may be considered should some of the underlying model assumptions seem inappropriate (e.g., non-proportional hazards). The reasons for any changes to the planned approach and methods will be fully documented.An additional analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using Cox-proportional hazards model controlling for the effect of NSAIDs use. The model will include treatment group, baseline renal function, and use of NSAIDs as explanatory variables. A similar analysis will control for the effect of low-dose aspirin use.To identify risk factors an additional exploratory analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using multivariate CPH modeling. The multivariate model will include treatment group and the following covariates jointly in the model with baseline renal function as the stratification factor: age, gender, BMI, NSAIDs use, low-dose aspirin use, smoking history, TMX-67_301Page 22 of 32Statistical Analysis Plan Amendment 322 February 2017CONFIDENTIALbaseline sUA, and history of diabetes, hypertension, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke. No interaction terms will be introduced in the multivariate model. The backward elimination technique with a significance level to stay (SLS) in the model of SLS = 0.05 will be implemented for variable selection while always retaining treatment group and baseline renal function as stratification factor in the model.In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with predefined MACE will be summarized within the levels of each subgroup variable. The relative risk (febuxostat versus allopurinol) and 95% CI based on the normal approximation will be calculated within the levels of each subgroup variable. Homogeneity among the levels of the subgroup variables will be assessed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. A forest plot indicating the point and 95% CI estimates of the risk ratios within the levels of each subgroup variable will also be presented.",

At the DMC meeting on , the DMC informed Takeda that the non-inferiority criterion for the primary endpoint was met at the 75% interim analysis conducted in. According to the study design, the study should have been stopped and the non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk should have been declared. However the DMC recommendation was to continue the trial without modification until the maximum 624 unique events were achieved to further assess all cause mortality (which was not a protocol specified endpoint) and CV mortality (which is specified only as a component of the MACE endpoint). Takeda agreed to follow the DMC recommendation and continue the study.Based on the group sequential design, the 75% interim analysis will be the primary analysis for the primary MACE endpoint for the purpose of statistical inference. The continuation of the study to protocol-specified maximum events (624 unique MACE) is for the assessment of all cause mortality and CV mortality. The analyses of all cause mortality and CV mortality with and without death events after discontinuation of treatments will be added to the end of study analysis. An updated sensitivity analysis for the primary MACE endpoint based on 624 unique MACE will also be conducted to provide additional supportive evidence for the primary endpoint.",

Approximately 7500 subjects will be randomly assigned to study \ndrug treatment.\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of predefined MACE. The length \nof the study is expected to be approximately 9 years. The length of study participation for each \nsubject will vary due to the event driven study design. This study is designed to have a maximum \nof 624 MACE.\nOn Study Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat \nonce daily (QD) or allopurinol QD. Randomization will be stratified based on baseline renal \nfunction (normal renal function or mild renal impairment versus moderate renal impairment). \nBaseline renal function will be defined using the following criteria based on estimated creatinine \nclearance (eCLcr):\n\uf0b7\nNormal renal function: defined as an eCLcr \u226590 mL/min.\n\uf0b7\nMild renal impairment: defined as an eCLcr 60 to 89 mL/min, inclusive.\n\uf0b7\nModerate renal impairment: defined as an eCLcr 30 to 59 mL/min, inclusive.\nwhere estimated creatinine clearance (eCLcr) is calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula \ncorrected for ideal body weight (IBW); IBW is 50 kg for males and 45.5 kg for women, plus \n2.3 kg for each inch in height >5 feet (60 inches)]:\n\uf028\n\uf029\uf028\n\uf029\uf028\n\uf029\n\uf028\n\uf029\n140-Age[yr]\nIBW[kg]\nwomen multiply by 0.85\neCLcr \n \n72\nserum creatinine [mg/dL]\n\uf0b4\n\uf03d\n\uf0b4\nSubjects randomized to febuxostat will initially receive the 40 mg dose QD. Subjects will remain \non 40 mg for the remainder of the study if their serum uric acid (sUA) is <6.0 mg/dL at the Week \n2 Visit. If their sUA is \u22656.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit they will receive febuxostat 80 mg QD at \nthe Week 4 visit, and will remain on this dose for the remainder of the study.\nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have normal renal function or mild renal impairment\nwill initially receive allopurinol 300 mg QD with the dose increased in 100 mg increments \nmonthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 600 mg QD is achieved. \nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have moderate renal impairment will initially receive \nallopurinol 200 mg QD with the dose increased in 100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA \nTMX-67_301\nPage 8 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n<6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 400 mg QD is achieved. The randomization and dosing \nschema are displayed in Figure 3.a.\nFigure 3.a\nDose Titration Based on sUA Response and By Baseline Renal Function in \nthe First Three Months of the Study\nSerum urate levels will be unblinded to the investigator and Takeda during the first 10 weeks of \nthe study to facilitate dose increases based on sUA response. After the Week 10 Visit, sUA \nmeasurements will be blinded to Takeda and the investigator. The interactive voice-activated \nresponse system/interactive web-activated response system (IVRS/IWRS) will manage the \ntreatment assignment after randomization and throughout the study medication treatment.\nTo maintain the double-blind nature of the study, febuxostat and allopurinol tablets will be \nover-encapsulated and matching placebo capsules will be manufactured which are identical in \nappearance. Subjects will orally self administer 2 capsules each morning in the appropriate \ncombination for their assigned dose and treatment.\nSubjects currently on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) will discontinue treatment at the Day -7\nScreening Visit, and will begin colchicine 0.6 mg QD for gout flare prophylaxis. Subjects not on \nULT will begin colchicine 0.6 mg QD on the Day 1/Randomization Visit. All subjects will \nreceive gout flare prophylaxis for the first six months of the study medication treatment period. \nAlternatively, if colchicine is not tolerated and the subject\u2019s eCLcr is \u226550 mL/min, they will be \nadministered naproxen 250 mg twice daily with lansoprazole 15 mg QD. If a subject has been \nTMX-67_301\nPage 9 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nmaintained on an appropriate dose (as determined by the investigator) of another proton pump \ninhibitor other than lansoprazole, he/she may continue treatment with it during this study. In \ninstances when subjects should not receive colchicine or naproxen, other nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or prednisone may be provided at the investigator\u2019s \ndiscretion.\nFollowing the Day 1/Randomization Visit, subjects will return for study visits during the first \n3 months of the study based on the subject\u2019s sUA response. Once a subject\u2019s sUA <6.0 mg/dL,\nthere will be no further visits until Month 3.\nAll subjects will return at Week 2 for measurement of sUA and all subjects will return for a \nWeek 4 and Month 3 visit. If the Week 2 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed \nstudy medication at Week 4, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If the Week 2 sUA level is \n\u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 4, and the next visit will \noccur at Week 6.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 6 visit, if the Week 6 sUA level is <6.0 mg/dL, the \nsubject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8, and the next visit will occur at Month 3. If \nthe Week 6 sUA level is \u22656.0 mg/dL, the subject will be dispensed study medication at Week 8\nand the next visit will occur at Week 10.\nFor the subset of subjects who have a Week 10 visit, the subject will be dispensed study \nmedication at the Month 3 visit. After the Month 3 visit, no further dose adjustments will be \nmade. All subjects will have Month 3 and Month 6 visits.\nFollowing the Month 6 visit, all subjects will have visits every 6 months for the duration of the \nstudy. In addition, subjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr <60mL/min) and/or subjects \nwho are elderly (\u226565 years of age) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor liver \nfunction tests. Subjects who are withdrawn from study medication treatment but have not \nwithdrawn consent will be followed via phone calls every 2 months until the end of the study or \nuntil the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE.\nA Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will periodically review results obtained in the study, \nincluding results at 3 planned interim analyses. They will monitor the progress and the on-going \nsafety of subjects enrolled into the study. An Independent CV Endpoints Committee will be \nestablished to prospectively review all suspected CV events using blinded data. A periodic \nreview of all serious adverse events and specific CV adverse event terms will be performed by \nthe Chair of the CV Endpoints Committee. The Chair, not the sponsor, will designate cases for \ncomprehensive review by the CV Endpoints Committee. All investigational sites will be required \nto collect relevant clinical information required for adjudication of all deaths and potential CV \nserious adverse events (SAE).\nTMX-67_301\nPage 10 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n4.0\nANALYSIS VARIABLES\n4.1\nPrimary Endpoint\nThe primary endpoint is the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any event in the \npredefined MACE composite, which includes:\n\uf0b7\nCV death.\n\uf0b7\nNon-fatal myocardial infarction (MI).\n\uf0b7\nNon-fatal stroke.\n\uf0b7\nUnstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization.\n4.2\nSecondary Endpoints\nThe secondary endpoints are:\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the first occurrence of any Antiplatelet Trialists\u2019\nCollaborative (APTC) event, which includes:\n\u2013\nCV death.\n\u2013\nNon-fatal MI.\n\u2013\nNon-fatal stroke.\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of each individual event in the pre-defined \nMACE composite.\n4.3\nAdditional Endpoints\nThe following are additional endpoints:\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the first occurrence of any event in the pre-defined MACE \ncomposite plus any of the following events:\n\u2013\nUrgent Cerebral revascularization [non-elective].\n\u2013\nHospitalized congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\u2013\nArrhythmias not associated with ischemia.\n\u2013\nVenous and peripheral arterial thromboembolic events; eg, Deep Vein Thrombosis \n(DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE).\n\u2013\nTransient Ischemic Attack (TIA).\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death.\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death during treatment (from \nrandomization to last dose of study medication).\n\uf0b7\nThe time from last dose of study medication to the occurrence of all-cause death.\n\uf0b7\nPercentage of subjects whose average sUA levels from the end of the first year of treatment \nto the end of the study are <4.0 mg/dL, \u22654 to <5.0 mg/dL, \u22655 to <6.0 mg/dL, and \n\u22656.0 mg/dL.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 11 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\uf0b7\nThe mean number of flares requiring treatment from the end of the first year of treatment to \nthe end of the study.\n\uf0b7\nPercentage of subjects with tophi resolution by the end of Years 1, 2, 3 and 4 for subjects \nwith a primary palpable tophus at the Day 1 Visit.\n\uf0b7\nOther safety assessments will include:\n\u2013\nAdverse events (including rash events),\n\u2013\nClinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis),\n\u2013\nVital signs measurements (blood pressure and heart rate), and\n\u2013\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) findings.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 12 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n5.0\nDETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE\nA total of 7500 subjects (3750 per treatment group) are planned to be enrolled in this study. The \nsample size will provide at least 90% power to meet a non-inferiority margin of 1.3 for the \nhazard ratio (febuxostat relative to allopurinol) of the primary endpoint. The sample size \ncalculation assumed a true hazard ratio of 1.0 at a 1-sided 2.5% significance level with 3 interim \nanalyses at approximately 25%, 50% and 75% of the events based on critical values obtained \nusing the Lan-DeMets - O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending function.\nFor the determination of non-inferiority between the febuxostat treatment group and the \nallopurinol treatment group, the sample size calculation further assumed:\n\uf0b7\nConstant proportional hazards and exponential survival curves,\n\uf0b7\nAnnual adjudicated MACE composite rate of 2.8%,\n\uf0b7\nMaximum length of participation of 5 years,\n\uf0b7\nAccrual time of 2.5 years, and\n\uf0b7\nAnnual drop-out rate of 10%.\nThis study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 13 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n6.0\nMETHODS OF ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION\n6.1\nGeneral Considerations\nThe SAS System with the HP-Unix operating system, will be used to perform the statistical \nanalyses. Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests and confidence intervals (CIs) will be \ntwo-sided and conducted at the 0.05 significance level. All computations will be performed prior \nto rounding. Statistical significance will be determined using p-values which have been rounded \nto 3 decimal places. Unless otherwise specified, descriptive statistics on continuous variables \nwill consist of the number of subjects (N), mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, \nmedian, 75th percentile, and maximum.\nFor the purpose of this document study drug will refer exclusively to the double-blind treatment \nnamely: febuxostat (40 mg QD or 80 mg QD) or allopurinol (200 mg to 600 mg QD in 100 mg \nincrements). Unless specified otherwise all statistical tables will be presented by febuxostat and \nallopurinol treatment groups with no summaries by dose.\n6.1.1\nBaseline, Study Day, and Window Conventions\nFor the time to event endpoints, time to event will be the time from the date of randomization to \nthe first occurrence of any event in the respective endpoint.\nA windowing convention will be used to determine the analysis value for a given study visit and \nwill be applicable for all by-visit summaries and analyses, unless otherwise specified. The \nconvention to be used for the analysis of efficacy and safety is summarized in Table 6.a.\nUnless otherwise specified, baseline will be defined as the last observation prior to receiving the \nfirst dose of study drug on Day 1, and post-baseline values will be defined as those values \ncollected within the specified window for that visit.\nIf a subject has more than one measurement in the same visit window, the measurement closest \nto the target day will be used. If two measurements in the same window are of equal distance to \nthe target day, the measurement that occurs after the target day will be used. If two or more \nmeasurements occur on the same day, the last repeat value will be used.\n6.2\nMajor Protocol Violations\nNo statistical analyses will be planned using the Per Protocol Set. Major protocol violations will \nbe summarized for this study.\n6.3\nAnalysis Sets\nThe primary endpoint and all other analyses by treatment group will be analyzed according to the \nrandomized treatment using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of all subjects \nwho were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind study medication. If a \nsubject reports a composite MACE after treatment discontinuation, then the reported event will \nbe counted toward the treatment to which they were randomized.\n",

In \naddition, within each treatment group, the duration of treatment by each dose will be \nsummarized.\nStudy drug compliance will be calculated and summarized with descriptive statistics and subject \ncounts within compliance categories (<80%, 80\uf02d<90%, \u226590%). Compliance (%) will be \ncalculated as the number of capsules taken divided by two times the number of days on drug.\nThe number and percentage of subjects on the final dose and with dose adjustment from initial \ndosing will be summarized by treatment group. The final doses based on sUA response and by \nbaseline renal function are summarized in Figure 3.a.\nThe number and percentage of subjects with use of each type of prophylactic medication based \non the initial dosing and dose adjustment from initial dosing will be summarized by treatment \ngroup. In addition, descriptive statistics on the total number of days (date of last dose - date of \nfirst dose + 1) of prophylactic dosing will be summarized by treatment group.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 18 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n6.7\nEfficacy Analysis\nEfficacy analyses will be summarized by the level of average post baseline sUA achieved using \nthe Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of all subjects who were randomized and \nreceived at least one dose of double-blind study medication. The average post-baseline sUA level \nduring the period from the end of the first year of treatment up to 1-day after a subject\u2019s last dose \nof study drug, will be grouped using the following categories <4.0 mg/dL, \u22654 to <5.0 mg/dL, \n\u22655 to <6.0 mg/dL, and \u22656.0 mg/dL.\nEfficacy analyses will not be summarized by treatment group. Since subjects will have their dose \nof study drug adjusted based on sUA response, the majority of subjects will have sUA values \nless than 6.0 mg/dL during treatment.\n6.7.1\nEfficacy Endpoints\nThere are no primary or secondary efficacy endpoints in the study. However, the following \nefficacy related other endpoints will be summarized.\n\uf0b7\nPercentage of subjects whose average sUA levels from the end of the first year of treatment \nto the end of the study are <4.0 mg/dL, \u22654 to <5.0 mg/dL, \u22655 to <6.0 mg/dL, and \n\u22656.0 mg/dL.\nAverage sUA will be computed based on all post-baseline sUA values collected from the \nend of the first year of treatment to the end of the study. For subjects with at least a year of \nstudy treatment exposure, all sUA values up to 1-day after a subject\u2019s last dose of study \ndrug will be included in the analyses.\n\uf0b7\nThe mean number of flares requiring treatment from the end of the first year of treatment to \nthe end of the study.\nThe flare rate from the end of the first year of treatment (>=365 Days) to the end of the \nstudy will be summarized. Flare rate will be calculated as the number of flares from the end \nof the first year of treatment to the end of the study divided by the length of time on \ntreatment during the period after the first year and through the end of study. The flare rate \nand 95% CI will be computed using Poisson regression model adjusted for treatment \nexposure with average sUA category as a factor in the model.\nFor subjects with at least a year of study treatment exposure, all flares up to 30 days after a \nsubject\u2019s last dose of study drug will be included in the analyses.\n\uf0b7\nPercentage of subjects with tophi resolution by in Years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 for subjects \nwith a primary palpable tophus at the Day 1 Visit.\nFor subjects with a primary tophus at baseline (Day 1 assessment), the percentage of \nsubjects with tophi resolution at the end of Years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of treatment will be \nsummarized. The estimate for tophi resolution rate will be calculated using the life-table \nmethod. In calculating the percentage of subjects with tophi resolution, yearly intervals will \nbe used in the life-table analysis. All tophus data up to 30 days after a subject\u2019s last dose of \nstudy drug will be included in the analyses.\n",

A CV Endpoints Committee blinded to treatment assignment will adjudicate potential \ncardiovascular adverse events and each death to determine if it meets MACE criteria. The \nprocedures and rules of adjudication of these events by the CV Endpoints Committee is\ndescribed in a separate charter.\nFor the primary, secondary, and additional safety endpoints, time to event will be the time from \nthe date of randomization or the date of last dose of study medication to the date of first \noccurrence of any event in the respective endpoint. If a subject reports an event for a given safety \nendpoint after treatment discontinuation, the reported event will be counted toward the treatment \nto which they were randomized. Subjects who are lost to follow-up during the study or who do \nnot exhibit an episode of an event for the specific safety endpoint throughout the study will be \ncensored at the day of last contact.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 21 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nAll safety endpoints will be analyzed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of \nall subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind study \nmedication. Non-inferiority will be assessed only for the primary safety endpoint.\n6.12.1 Primary Safety Endpoint\nThe primary safety variable is the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any event in \nthe predefined MACE composite. The goal of the primary safety analysis is to compare the risk \nof a predefined MACE during treatment with febuxostat to that of allopurinol.\nSurvival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model will be fitted on the time to \nthe first occurrence of any event in the predefined MACE composite. The hazard ratio\n(febuxostat versus allopurinol) for the primary safety endpoint will be computed based on \nfebuxostat and allopurinol estimated hazard rates. The febuxostat treatment group will be \ncompared to the allopurinol treatment group to test for non-inferiority in the MACE composite \nrate using a CPH model with treatment as factor in the model and baseline renal function as a \nstratification factor. Non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol will be declared (at an interim or \nat the final analysis) if the current upper 1-sided CI for the hazard ratio calculated with critical \nvalues obtained using the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending function, which \npreserves an overall 1-sided false-rejection rate of 2.5%, is less than 1.3.\nKaplan-Meier plot for the time to first occurrence of any event in the adjudicated MACE \ncomposite will be produced by treatment group (overall and within the levels of the stratification \nfactor, baseline renal function).\nA sensitivity analysis on the primary safety endpoint will also be performed by excluding MACE \nthat occur more than 30 days after treatment discontinuation.\nAssessment of the proportional hazards assumption will be made by inspection of the \nKaplan-Meier curves and using plots of Schoenfeld residuals. In the Kaplan-Meier curves, if the \nproportional hazard assumption is satisfied then the graph of the survival function versus the \nsurvival time should result in a graph with parallel curves. In the plots of Schoenfeld residuals, if \nthe proportional hazard assumption is satisfied then the graph of the Schoenfeld residuals \nobtained from the primary CPH model versus the ordered time of events along with smoothing \nspline should result in a horizontal line.\nAlternative methods of analysis may be considered should some of the underlying model \nassumptions seem inappropriate (e.g., non-proportional hazards). The reasons for any changes to \nthe planned approach and methods will be fully documented.\nAn additional analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using Cox-proportional \nhazards model controlling for the effect of NSAIDs use. The model will include treatment group, \nbaseline renal function, and use of NSAIDs as explanatory variables. A similar analysis will \ncontrol for the effect of low-dose aspirin use.\nTo identify risk factors an additional exploratory analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be \nperformed using multivariate CPH modeling. The multivariate model will include treatment \ngroup and the following covariates jointly in the model with baseline renal function as the \nstratification factor: age, gender, BMI, NSAIDs use, low-dose aspirin use, smoking history, \nTMX-67_301\nPage 22 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nbaseline sUA, and history of diabetes, hypertension, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke. No \ninteraction terms will be introduced in the multivariate model. The backward elimination \ntechnique with a significance level to stay (SLS) in the model of SLS = 0.05 will be \nimplemented for variable selection while always retaining treatment group and baseline renal \nfunction as stratification factor in the model.\nIn addition, the number and percentage of subjects with predefined MACE will be summarized \nwithin the levels of each subgroup variable. The relative risk (febuxostat versus allopurinol) and \n95% CI based on the normal approximation will be calculated within the levels of each subgroup \nvariable. Homogeneity among the levels of the subgroup variables will be assessed using the \nCochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. A forest plot indicating the point and 95% CI estimates of the \nrisk ratios within the levels of each subgroup variable will also be presented.\n6.12.2 Secondary Safety Endpoints\nThe following secondary safety endpoints will be assessed:\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the first occurrence of any Antiplatelet Trialists\u2019 \nCollaborative (APTC) event (CV Death, Non-fatal MI, and Non-fatal Stroke).\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of each individual event in the pre-defined \nMACE composite.\nSurvival analysis using the CPH model will be performed on the time to the first occurrence of \nany APTC event and on the time to occurrence of each individual event in the pre-defined \nMACE composite. Parameter estimates and 2-sided 95% CIs for the hazard ratio will be \ncomputed. A graphical display indicating the point and 95% CI estimates of the hazard ratios for \nthe primary MACE components will also be presented.\nTo identify risk factors for the time to first occurrence of APTC event, an exploratory analysis \nwill also be performed using multivariate CPH modeling. The multivariate model will include \ntreatment group and the following covariates jointly in the model with baseline renal function as \nthe stratification factor: age, gender, BMI, NSAIDs use, low-dose aspirin use, smoking history, \nbaseline sUA, and history of diabetes, hypertension, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke. No \ninteraction terms will be introduced in the multivariate model. The backward elimination \ntechnique with a significance level to stay (SLS) in the model of SLS = 0.05 will be \nimplemented for variable selection while always retaining treatment group and baseline renal \nfunction as stratification factor in the model.\nIn addition, Kaplan-Meier plots for the time to first occurrence of APTC event and the time to \nfirst occurrence of each individual event in the pre-defined MACE will be presented by treatment \ngroup.\n6.12.3 Other Safety Endpoints\nThe following additional safety endpoints will also be assessed:\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the first occurrence of any event in the pre-defined MACE \ncomposite plus any of the following events:\nTMX-67_301\nPage 23 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\u2013\nUrgent Cerebral revascularization [non-elective].\n\u2013\nHospitalized congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\u2013\nArrhythmias not associated with ischemia.\n\u2013\nVenous and peripheral arterial thromboembolic events; eg, Deep Vein Thrombosis \n(DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE).\n\u2013\nTransient Ischemic Attack (TIA).\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death,\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death during treatment (from \nrandomization to last dose of study medication),\n\uf0b7\nThe time from last dose of study medication to the occurrence of all-cause death,\nSurvival analysis using the CPH model will be performed for these additional endpoints. \nParameter estimates and a 2-sided 95% CI for the hazard ratio will be computed. \nKaplan-Meier plots will also be presented by treatment group.\nThe following other additional safety analyses will also be performed:\n\uf0b7\nThe number of subjects with first occurrence of predefined MACE that occur no more than \n30 days after a subject\u2019s last dose of study drug and the associated incidence rate by \n100 patient-years of exposure along with 95% confidence intervals will be summarized by \ntreatment group. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the Poisson distribution. For a \ngiven treatment total patient-years (PY) of exposure will be calculated by summing across all \nsubjects the total number of days on the treatment and dividing by 365.\nThe same analysis will be performed for each component of the MACE composite.\n\uf0b7\nMortality analyses for the overall and by CV and Non-CV cause. The total number deaths \nand the death rate with 95% CI will be presented. The 95% CIs for the death rate will be \ncalculated based on the Binomial distribution using exact method.\n\uf0b7\nThe number and percentage of subjects with first occurrence of a pre-defined MACE \ncomposite will be presented by number of days in the study.\n\uf0b7\nList of CV risk factors for subjects with a predefined MACE composite comprising diabetes, \nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking will be provided by treatment group.\nListings include subject number, age, gender, baseline renal function, primary MACE \ncomponent, disposition, primary reason for discontinuation if disposition is early term, and \nCV risk factors.\n6.12.4 Adverse Events\nAn adverse event (AE) will be defined as any AE, regardless of relationship to study drug, that \noccurs on or after the date of randomization and up to 30 days after the last dose. An event with a \nreported onset date after the subject has signed the informed consent document but prior to the \ndate of randomization will be considered a pre-treatment event. Treatment-emergent adverse \nevents (TEAEs) are defined as AEs whose onset occurs, severity worsens or intensity increases \nafter receiving the study medication and up to 30 days after the last dose. Treatment-related \nTMX-67_301\nPage 24 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nadverse events will be defined as treatment-emergent AEs which were identified by the \ninvestigator to be related to study drug.\nTreatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized using the latest Medical Dictionary for \nRegulatory Agencies (MedDRA) coding dictionary. In general all AEs will be tabulated at each \nof the following levels by treatment group and overall: overall summary (subject with at least \n1 AE), the MedDRA system organ class (SOC), the MedDRA high level term (HLT), and the \nMedDRA preferred term (PT). Tabulations at each level of a term will present count (n) and \npercentage of subjects reporting any event for that term. Subjects reporting more than one \noccurrence for the term (level) being summarized will be counted only once. Summaries \ninvolving severity (or relationship to study drug) will use the most severe (or most related) event \nwhen a subject has more than one event for a term. If the severity level of an AE is missing, the \nintensity of AE is considered to be severe.\nAdverse events will be summarized as follows:\n\uf0b7\nA high-level summary of AEs which include the numbers and percentages of subjects for the \nfollowing categories:\n\u2013\nAny TEAE, any treatment-related TEAE, any TEAE leading to study drug withdrawal, \nany treatment-emergent serious adverse event (SAE), any treatment-related SAE, and any \ndeath.\n\uf0b7\nAll treatment-emergent/ treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Preferred Term.\n\uf0b7\nAll TEAEs by relationship to study drug.\n\uf0b7\nAll treatment-emergent/ treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs for subjects in each of the \nfollowing subgroups:\n\u2013\nBaseline Renal function.\n\u2013\nProphylactic medication taken.\n\uf0b7\nAll treatment-emergent/treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs by MedDRA system \norgan class and high level term versus severity.\n\uf0b7\nRash treatment-emergent/ treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-emergent/ treatment-related treatment-emergent serious AEs.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-emergent/treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs Leading to Study Drug \nWithdrawal.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-emergent/treatment-related treatment-emergent serious AEs Leading to Study \nDrug Withdrawal.\n\uf0b7\nAll pre-treatment AEs.\nThe following listings will also be provided:\n\uf0b7\nAll unique MedDRA terms.\n\uf0b7\nAdverse Events Leading To Study Drug Withdrawal During Treatment Period.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 25 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\uf0b7\nSerious Adverse Events.\n\uf0b7\nAdverse Events Resulting in Deaths.\nThe number of AEs per 100 subject-years will be displayed for each level of summarization in \nall AE Tables. This calculation counts all episodes of an AE, including multiple events for the \nsame subject.

Laboratory data will be \nsummarized at baseline and each post-baseline visit. The laboratory analyses will be performed \non values obtained on study and no more than 7 days after last dose of study drug. For \nHematology and Urinalysis since laboratory assessments are done only at screening, only \nbaseline descriptive summaries will be provided.\n6.12.5.1 Mean Change from Baseline\nFor serum chemistry laboratory variables, descriptive statistics will be presented for baseline, \npost-baseline, and change from baseline. \n6.12.5.2 Markedly Abnormal Laboratory Values\nFor chemistry serum laboratory variables, the number and percentage of subjects with at least \none markedly abnormal value at each post-baseline visit and the end of study will be presented. \nIn addition, the number and percentage of subjects with any markedly abnormal value for serum \nchemistry variables will also be presented at each post-baseline visit.\nCriteria for identifying markedly abnormal values have been established by Takeda\nPharmacovigilance and Clinical Science Departments, and values meeting the criteria will be \nlisted by subject.\n6.12.5.3 Shifts Relative to Normal Range\nShift tables showing the number of subjects with low, normal, or high values at each \npost-baseline visit according to the central laboratory\u2019s reference ranges will be presented.\n6.12.6 Vital Signs\nDescriptive statistics for baseline, post-baseline, and change from baseline will be computed by \ntreatment group for all vital sign parameters (pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic \nblood pressure).

Approximately 7500 subjects will be randomly assigned to study \ndrug treatment.\nThe overall duration of the study is dependent on the number of predefined MACE. The length \nof the study is expected to be approximately 9 years. The length of study participation for each \nsubject will vary due to the event driven study design. This study is designed to have a maximum \nof 624 MACE.\nOn Study Day 1, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either febuxostat \nonce daily (QD) or allopurinol QD. Randomization will be stratified based on baseline renal \nfunction (normal renal function or mild renal impairment versus moderate renal impairment). \nBaseline renal function will be defined using the following criteria based on estimated creatinine \nclearance (eCLcr):\n\uf0b7\nNormal renal function: defined as an eCLcr \u226590 mL/min.\n\uf0b7\nMild renal impairment: defined as an eCLcr 60 to 89 mL/min, inclusive.\n\uf0b7\nModerate renal impairment: defined as an eCLcr 30 to 59 mL/min, inclusive.\nwhere estimated creatinine clearance (eCLcr) is calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula \ncorrected for ideal body weight (IBW); IBW is 50 kg for males and 45.5 kg for women, plus \n2.3 kg for each inch in height >5 feet (60 inches)]:\n\uf028\n\uf029\uf028\n\uf029\uf028\n\uf029\n\uf028\n\uf029\n140-Age[yr]\nIBW[kg]\nwomen multiply by 0.85\neCLcr \n \n72\nserum creatinine [mg/dL]\n\uf0b4\n\uf03d\n\uf0b4\nSubjects randomized to febuxostat will initially receive the 40 mg dose QD. Subjects will remain \non 40 mg for the remainder of the study if their serum uric acid (sUA) is <6.0 mg/dL at the Week \n2 Visit. If their sUA is \u22656.0 mg/dL at the Week 2 Visit they will receive febuxostat 80 mg QD at \nthe Week 4 visit, and will remain on this dose for the remainder of the study.\nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have normal renal function or mild renal impairment\nwill initially receive allopurinol 300 mg QD with the dose increased in 100 mg increments \nmonthly until either a sUA <6.0 mg/dL or an allopurinol dose of 600 mg QD is achieved. \nSubjects randomized to allopurinol who have moderate renal impairment will initially receive \nallopurinol 200 mg QD with the dose increased in 100 mg increments monthly until either a sUA \n",

In addition, subjects with moderate renal impairment (eCLcr <60mL/min) and/or subjects \nwho are elderly (\u226565 years of age) will have visits at Month 9 and Month 15 to monitor liver \nfunction tests. Subjects who are withdrawn from study medication treatment but have not \nwithdrawn consent will be followed via phone calls every 2 months until the end of the study or \nuntil the subject experiences a CV event that is positively adjudicated as a MACE.\nA Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will periodically review results obtained in the study, \nincluding results at 3 planned interim analyses. They will monitor the progress and the on-going \nsafety of subjects enrolled into the study. An Independent CV Endpoints Committee will be \nestablished to prospectively review all suspected CV events using blinded data. A periodic \nreview of all serious adverse events and specific CV adverse event terms will be performed by \nthe Chair of the CV Endpoints Committee. The Chair, not the sponsor, will designate cases for \ncomprehensive review by the CV Endpoints Committee. All investigational sites will be required \nto collect relevant clinical information required for adjudication of all deaths and potential CV \nserious adverse events (SAE).\nTMX-67_301\nPage 10 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n4.0\nANALYSIS VARIABLES\n4.1\nPrimary Endpoint\nThe primary endpoint is the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any event in the \npredefined MACE composite, which includes:\n\uf0b7\nCV death.\n\uf0b7\nNon-fatal myocardial infarction (MI).\n\uf0b7\nNon-fatal stroke.\n\uf0b7\nUnstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization.\n4.2\nSecondary Endpoints\nThe secondary endpoints are:\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the first occurrence of any Antiplatelet Trialists\u2019\nCollaborative (APTC) event, which includes:\n\u2013\nCV death.\n\u2013\nNon-fatal MI.\n\u2013\nNon-fatal stroke.\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of each individual event in the pre-defined \nMACE composite.\n4.3\nAdditional Endpoints\nThe following are additional endpoints:\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the first occurrence of any event in the pre-defined MACE \ncomposite plus any of the following events:\n\u2013\nUrgent Cerebral revascularization [non-elective].\n\u2013\nHospitalized congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\u2013\nArrhythmias not associated with ischemia.\n\u2013\nVenous and peripheral arterial thromboembolic events; eg, Deep Vein Thrombosis \n(DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE).\n\u2013\nTransient Ischemic Attack (TIA).\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death.\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death during treatment (from \nrandomization to last dose of study medication).\n\uf0b7\nThe time from last dose of study medication to the occurrence of all-cause death.\n\uf0b7\nPercentage of subjects whose average sUA levels from the end of the first year of treatment \nto the end of the study are <4.0 mg/dL, \u22654 to <5.0 mg/dL, \u22655 to <6.0 mg/dL, and \n\u22656.0 mg/dL.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 11 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\uf0b7\nThe mean number of flares requiring treatment from the end of the first year of treatment to \nthe end of the study.\n\uf0b7\nPercentage of subjects with tophi resolution by the end of Years 1, 2, 3 and 4 for subjects \nwith a primary palpable tophus at the Day 1 Visit.\n\uf0b7\nOther safety assessments will include:\n\u2013\nAdverse events (including rash events),\n\u2013\nClinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis),\n\u2013\nVital signs measurements (blood pressure and heart rate), and\n\u2013\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) findings.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 12 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n5.0\nDETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE\nA total of 7500 subjects (3750 per treatment group) are planned to be enrolled in this study.

Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests and confidence intervals (CIs) will be \ntwo-sided and conducted at the 0.05 significance level. All computations will be performed prior \nto rounding. Statistical significance will be determined using p-values which have been rounded \nto 3 decimal places. Unless otherwise specified, descriptive statistics on continuous variables \nwill consist of the number of subjects (N), mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, \nmedian, 75th percentile, and maximum.\nFor the purpose of this document study drug will refer exclusively to the double-blind treatment \nnamely: febuxostat (40 mg QD or 80 mg QD) or allopurinol (200 mg to 600 mg QD in 100 mg \nincrements). Unless specified otherwise all statistical tables will be presented by febuxostat and \nallopurinol treatment groups with no summaries by dose.\n6.1.1\nBaseline, Study Day, and Window Conventions\nFor the time to event endpoints, time to event will be the time from the date of randomization to \nthe first occurrence of any event in the respective endpoint.\nA windowing convention will be used to determine the analysis value for a given study visit and \nwill be applicable for all by-visit summaries and analyses, unless otherwise specified. The \nconvention to be used for the analysis of efficacy and safety is summarized in Table 6.a.\nUnless otherwise specified, baseline will be defined as the last observation prior to receiving the \nfirst dose of study drug on Day 1, and post-baseline values will be defined as those values \ncollected within the specified window for that visit.\nIf a subject has more than one measurement in the same visit window, the measurement closest \nto the target day will be used. If two measurements in the same window are of equal distance to \nthe target day, the measurement that occurs after the target day will be used. If two or more \nmeasurements occur on the same day, the last repeat value will be used.\n6.2\nMajor Protocol Violations\nNo statistical analyses will be planned using the Per Protocol Set. Major protocol violations will \nbe summarized for this study.\n6.3\nAnalysis Sets\nThe primary endpoint and all other analyses by treatment group will be analyzed according to the \nrandomized treatment using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of all subjects \nwho were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind study medication. If a \nsubject reports a composite MACE after treatment discontinuation, then the reported event will \nbe counted toward the treatment to which they were randomized.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 14 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nTable 6.a\nVisit Windows for Efficacy and Safety Variables\nVisit ID\nTarget Day\nWindow\nBaseline\n1\nDay \uf0a31\nWeek 2\n14\nDays 2 to 21\nWeek 4\n28\nDays 22 to 35\nWeek 6\n42\nDays 36 to 49\nWeek 8\n56\nDays 50 to 63\nWeek 10\n70\nDays 64 to 81\nMonth 3\n91\nDays 82 to 137\nMonth 6\n182\nDays 138 to 228\nMonth 9\n273\nDays 229 to 319\nMonth 12\n364\nDays 320 to 410\nMonth 15\n455\nDays 411 to 501\nMonth 18\n546\nDays 502 to 637\nMonth 24\n728\nDays 638 to 819\nMonth 30\n910\nDays 820 to 1001\nMonth 36\n1092\nDays 1002 to 1183\nMonth 42\n1274\nDays 1184 to 1365\nMonth 48\n1456\nDays 1366 to 1547\nMonth 54\n1638\nDays 1548 to 1729\nMonth 60\n1820\nDays 1730 to 1911\nMonth 66\n2002\nDays 1912 to 2093\nMonth 72\n2184\nDays 2094 to 2275\nMonth 78\n2366\nDays 2276 to 2457\nMonth 84\n2548\nDays\u22652458\n6.4\nDisposition of Subjects\nSubject eligibility will be summarized by number of subjects screened and by number and \npercentage of subjects randomized and not randomized.

If a subject reports \ndifferent severity level for the same signs and symptoms category during the study period, \nthe most severe level will be used for summary purposes.\n6.8\nPharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis\nNot Applicable.\n6.9\nQuality-of-Life Analysis\nNot Applicable.\n6.10\nPharmacoeconomic Analysis\nNot Applicable.\n6.11\nOther Outcomes\nNot Applicable.\n6.12\nSafety Analysis\nSafety will be assessed by evaluating the incidence of adverse events including cardiovascular \nadverse events such as predefined MACE composite, and evaluating ECGs; laboratory tests and \nvital signs. A CV Endpoints Committee blinded to treatment assignment will adjudicate potential \ncardiovascular adverse events and each death to determine if it meets MACE criteria. The \nprocedures and rules of adjudication of these events by the CV Endpoints Committee is\ndescribed in a separate charter.\nFor the primary, secondary, and additional safety endpoints, time to event will be the time from \nthe date of randomization or the date of last dose of study medication to the date of first \noccurrence of any event in the respective endpoint. If a subject reports an event for a given safety \nendpoint after treatment discontinuation, the reported event will be counted toward the treatment \nto which they were randomized. Subjects who are lost to follow-up during the study or who do \nnot exhibit an episode of an event for the specific safety endpoint throughout the study will be \ncensored at the day of last contact.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 21 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nAll safety endpoints will be analyzed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS will consist of \nall subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind study \nmedication. Non-inferiority will be assessed only for the primary safety endpoint.\n6.12.1 Primary Safety Endpoint\nThe primary safety variable is the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any event in \nthe predefined MACE composite. The goal of the primary safety analysis is to compare the risk \nof a predefined MACE during treatment with febuxostat to that of allopurinol.\nSurvival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model will be fitted on the time to \nthe first occurrence of any event in the predefined MACE composite. The hazard ratio\n(febuxostat versus allopurinol) for the primary safety endpoint will be computed based on \nfebuxostat and allopurinol estimated hazard rates. The febuxostat treatment group will be \ncompared to the allopurinol treatment group to test for non-inferiority in the MACE composite \nrate using a CPH model with treatment as factor in the model and baseline renal function as a \nstratification factor. Non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol will be declared (at an interim or \nat the final analysis) if the current upper 1-sided CI for the hazard ratio calculated with critical \nvalues obtained using the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending function, which \npreserves an overall 1-sided false-rejection rate of 2.5%, is less than 1.3.\nKaplan-Meier plot for the time to first occurrence of any event in the adjudicated MACE \ncomposite will be produced by treatment group (overall and within the levels of the stratification \nfactor, baseline renal function).\nA sensitivity analysis on the primary safety endpoint will also be performed by excluding MACE \nthat occur more than 30 days after treatment discontinuation.\nAssessment of the proportional hazards assumption will be made by inspection of the \nKaplan-Meier curves and using plots of Schoenfeld residuals. In the Kaplan-Meier curves, if the \nproportional hazard assumption is satisfied then the graph of the survival function versus the \nsurvival time should result in a graph with parallel curves. In the plots of Schoenfeld residuals, if \nthe proportional hazard assumption is satisfied then the graph of the Schoenfeld residuals \nobtained from the primary CPH model versus the ordered time of events along with smoothing \nspline should result in a horizontal line.\nAlternative methods of analysis may be considered should some of the underlying model \nassumptions seem inappropriate (e.g., non-proportional hazards). The reasons for any changes to \nthe planned approach and methods will be fully documented.\nAn additional analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed using Cox-proportional \nhazards model controlling for the effect of NSAIDs use. The model will include treatment group, \nbaseline renal function, and use of NSAIDs as explanatory variables. A similar analysis will \ncontrol for the effect of low-dose aspirin use.\nTo identify risk factors an additional exploratory analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be \nperformed using multivariate CPH modeling. The multivariate model will include treatment \ngroup and the following covariates jointly in the model with baseline renal function as the \nstratification factor: age, gender, BMI, NSAIDs use, low-dose aspirin use, smoking history, \nTMX-67_301\nPage 22 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nbaseline sUA, and history of diabetes, hypertension, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke. No \ninteraction terms will be introduced in the multivariate model. The backward elimination \ntechnique with a significance level to stay (SLS) in the model of SLS = 0.05 will be \nimplemented for variable selection while always retaining treatment group and baseline renal \nfunction as stratification factor in the model.\nIn addition, the number and percentage of subjects with predefined MACE will be summarized \nwithin the levels of each subgroup variable. The relative risk (febuxostat versus allopurinol) and \n95% CI based on the normal approximation will be calculated within the levels of each subgroup \nvariable. Homogeneity among the levels of the subgroup variables will be assessed using the \nCochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. A forest plot indicating the point and 95% CI estimates of the \nrisk ratios within the levels of each subgroup variable will also be presented.\n6.12.2 Secondary Safety Endpoints\nThe following secondary safety endpoints will be assessed:\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the first occurrence of any Antiplatelet Trialists\u2019 \nCollaborative (APTC) event (CV Death, Non-fatal MI, and Non-fatal Stroke).\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of each individual event in the pre-defined \nMACE composite.\nSurvival analysis using the CPH model will be performed on the time to the first occurrence of \nany APTC event and on the time to occurrence of each individual event in the pre-defined \nMACE composite. Parameter estimates and 2-sided 95% CIs for the hazard ratio will be \ncomputed. A graphical display indicating the point and 95% CI estimates of the hazard ratios for \nthe primary MACE components will also be presented.\nTo identify risk factors for the time to first occurrence of APTC event, an exploratory analysis \nwill also be performed using multivariate CPH modeling. The multivariate model will include \ntreatment group and the following covariates jointly in the model with baseline renal function as \nthe stratification factor: age, gender, BMI, NSAIDs use, low-dose aspirin use, smoking history, \nbaseline sUA, and history of diabetes, hypertension, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke. No \ninteraction terms will be introduced in the multivariate model. The backward elimination \ntechnique with a significance level to stay (SLS) in the model of SLS = 0.05 will be \nimplemented for variable selection while always retaining treatment group and baseline renal \nfunction as stratification factor in the model.\nIn addition, Kaplan-Meier plots for the time to first occurrence of APTC event and the time to \nfirst occurrence of each individual event in the pre-defined MACE will be presented by treatment \ngroup.\n6.12.3 Other Safety Endpoints\nThe following additional safety endpoints will also be assessed:\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the first occurrence of any event in the pre-defined MACE \ncomposite plus any of the following events:\nTMX-67_301\nPage 23 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\u2013\nUrgent Cerebral revascularization [non-elective].\n\u2013\nHospitalized congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\u2013\nArrhythmias not associated with ischemia.\n\u2013\nVenous and peripheral arterial thromboembolic events; eg, Deep Vein Thrombosis \n(DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE).\n\u2013\nTransient Ischemic Attack (TIA).\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death,\n\uf0b7\nThe time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death during treatment (from \nrandomization to last dose of study medication),\n\uf0b7\nThe time from last dose of study medication to the occurrence of all-cause death,\nSurvival analysis using the CPH model will be performed for these additional endpoints. \nParameter estimates and a 2-sided 95% CI for the hazard ratio will be computed. \nKaplan-Meier plots will also be presented by treatment group.\nThe following other additional safety analyses will also be performed:\n\uf0b7\nThe number of subjects with first occurrence of predefined MACE that occur no more than \n30 days after a subject\u2019s last dose of study drug and the associated incidence rate by \n100 patient-years of exposure along with 95% confidence intervals will be summarized by \ntreatment group. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the Poisson distribution. For a \ngiven treatment total patient-years (PY) of exposure will be calculated by summing across all \nsubjects the total number of days on the treatment and dividing by 365.\nThe same analysis will be performed for each component of the MACE composite.\n\uf0b7\nMortality analyses for the overall and by CV and Non-CV cause. The total number deaths \nand the death rate with 95% CI will be presented. The 95% CIs for the death rate will be \ncalculated based on the Binomial distribution using exact method.\n\uf0b7\nThe number and percentage of subjects with first occurrence of a pre-defined MACE \ncomposite will be presented by number of days in the study.\n\uf0b7\nList of CV risk factors for subjects with a predefined MACE composite comprising diabetes, \nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking will be provided by treatment group.\nListings include subject number, age, gender, baseline renal function, primary MACE \ncomponent, disposition, primary reason for discontinuation if disposition is early term, and \nCV risk factors.\n6.12.4 Adverse Events\nAn adverse event (AE) will be defined as any AE, regardless of relationship to study drug, that \noccurs on or after the date of randomization and up to 30 days after the last dose. An event with a \nreported onset date after the subject has signed the informed consent document but prior to the \ndate of randomization will be considered a pre-treatment event. Treatment-emergent adverse \nevents (TEAEs) are defined as AEs whose onset occurs, severity worsens or intensity increases \nafter receiving the study medication and up to 30 days after the last dose. Treatment-related \nTMX-67_301\nPage 24 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nadverse events will be defined as treatment-emergent AEs which were identified by the \ninvestigator to be related to study drug.\nTreatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized using the latest Medical Dictionary for \nRegulatory Agencies (MedDRA) coding dictionary. In general all AEs will be tabulated at each \nof the following levels by treatment group and overall: overall summary (subject with at least \n1 AE), the MedDRA system organ class (SOC), the MedDRA high level term (HLT), and the \nMedDRA preferred term (PT). Tabulations at each level of a term will present count (n) and \npercentage of subjects reporting any event for that term. Subjects reporting more than one \noccurrence for the term (level) being summarized will be counted only once. Summaries \ninvolving severity (or relationship to study drug) will use the most severe (or most related) event \nwhen a subject has more than one event for a term. If the severity level of an AE is missing, the \nintensity of AE is considered to be severe.\nAdverse events will be summarized as follows:\n\uf0b7\nA high-level summary of AEs which include the numbers and percentages of subjects for the \nfollowing categories:\n\u2013\nAny TEAE, any treatment-related TEAE, any TEAE leading to study drug withdrawal, \nany treatment-emergent serious adverse event (SAE), any treatment-related SAE, and any \ndeath.\n\uf0b7\nAll treatment-emergent/ treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-Emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Preferred Term.\n\uf0b7\nAll TEAEs by relationship to study drug.\n\uf0b7\nAll treatment-emergent/ treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs for subjects in each of the \nfollowing subgroups:\n\u2013\nBaseline Renal function.\n\u2013\nProphylactic medication taken.\n\uf0b7\nAll treatment-emergent/treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs by MedDRA system \norgan class and high level term versus severity.\n\uf0b7\nRash treatment-emergent/ treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-emergent/ treatment-related treatment-emergent serious AEs.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-emergent/treatment-related treatment-emergent AEs Leading to Study Drug \nWithdrawal.\n\uf0b7\nTreatment-emergent/treatment-related treatment-emergent serious AEs Leading to Study \nDrug Withdrawal.\n\uf0b7\nAll pre-treatment AEs.\nThe following listings will also be provided:\n\uf0b7\nAll unique MedDRA terms.\n\uf0b7\nAdverse Events Leading To Study Drug Withdrawal During Treatment Period.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 25 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\uf0b7\nSerious Adverse Events.\n\uf0b7\nAdverse Events Resulting in Deaths.\nThe number of AEs per 100 subject-years will be displayed for each level of summarization in \nall AE Tables. This calculation counts all episodes of an AE, including multiple events for the \nsame subject. For a given treatment total patient-years (PY) of exposure will be calculated by \nsumming across all subjects total number of days on the treatment and dividing by 365.\n6.12.5 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations\nLaboratory data include hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis variables. Laboratory data will be \nsummarized at baseline and each post-baseline visit. The laboratory analyses will be performed \non values obtained on study and no more than 7 days after last dose of study drug. For \nHematology and Urinalysis since laboratory assessments are done only at screening, only \nbaseline descriptive summaries will be provided.\n6.12.5.1 Mean Change from Baseline\nFor serum chemistry laboratory variables, descriptive statistics will be presented for baseline, \npost-baseline, and change from baseline. \n6.12.5.2 Markedly Abnormal Laboratory Values\nFor chemistry serum laboratory variables, the number and percentage of subjects with at least \none markedly abnormal value at each post-baseline visit and the end of study will be presented. \nIn addition, the number and percentage of subjects with any markedly abnormal value for serum \nchemistry variables will also be presented at each post-baseline visit.\nCriteria for identifying markedly abnormal values have been established by Takeda\nPharmacovigilance and Clinical Science Departments, and values meeting the criteria will be \nlisted by subject.\n6.12.5.3 Shifts Relative to Normal Range\nShift tables showing the number of subjects with low, normal, or high values at each \npost-baseline visit according to the central laboratory\u2019s reference ranges will be presented.\n6.12.6 Vital Signs\nDescriptive statistics for baseline, post-baseline, and change from baseline will be computed by \ntreatment group for all vital sign parameters (pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic \nblood pressure). Data collected from baseline and up to 7 days after a subject\u2019s last dose of study \ndrug will be included.\nFor each vital sign parameter, the number and percentage of subjects with at least one markedly \nabnormal value at each post-baseline visit and the end of study will be presented. In addition, the \nnumber and percentage of subjects with any markedly abnormal value for a vital sign parameter \nwill also be presented at each post-baseline visit. Listing of Markedly Abnormal Laboratory \nValues will also be presented.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 26 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n6.12.7 12-Lead ECGs\nThe number and percentage of subjects in each overall ECG interpretation category (normal, \nclinically significant abnormal, non-clinically significant abnormal) at baseline and Final Visit/ \nEarly Termination will be summarized. Percentages will be based on the number of subjects with \nvalues at each visit. Data collected from baseline and up to 7 days after a subject\u2019s last dose of \nstudy drug will be included.\nIn addition, shift tables showing the number of subjects with normal, clinically significant \nabnormal, or non-clinically significant abnormal ECG interpretation results at post-baseline visit \nwill be provided.\nFor the ECG interpretation summaries, if a subject has multiple interpretations at a particular \nvisit, the most significant result will be selected for summary.\n6.13\nInterim Analysis\nThis study is designed to have a maximum of 624 MACE composite events for assessing \nnon-inferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk assuming a \ntrue hazard ratio of 1.0 and 90% power. Interim analyses will be conducted when approximately \n25%, 50% and 75% of the events or equivalently approximately 156, 312, and 468 events have \noccurred, followed by a final analysis. In this group sequential trial with 4 equally-spaced \nanalyses and a one-sided overall significance level of 0.025, the Lan-DeMets alpha spending \napproach with an O\u2019Brien-Fleming stopping boundary will be used. Table 6.c displays the \nprojected critical boundaries and the overall 1-sided 2.5% significance level spending at each \ninterim analysis obtained from the O\u2019Brien-Fleming spending function. East\u00ae5.3 was used to \ndetermine the critical boundaries.\nTable 6.c\nO\u2019Brien-Fleming Spending Function\nInterim \nLook\nInformation\nFraction\nCritical \nBoundary\nAlpha Spending at \nEach Interim\nCumulative Alpha \nSpending\n1\n156/624 = 0.25\n4.333\n0.000\n0.000\n2\n312/624 = 0.50\n2.963\n0.002\n0.002\n3\n468/624 = 0.75\n2.359\n0.008\n0.010\n4\n624/624 = 1.00\n2.014\n0.015\n0.025\nTherefore, at the 3 interim and at the final analyses, one-sided confidence intervals for the hazard \nratio of febuxostat relative to allopurinol for the primary endpoint will be constructed using \ncritical values obtained using the Lan-DeMets -O\u2019Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. At \neach analysis, if the upper confidence limit of the hazard ratio is \u22641.3, the study will be stopped \nand the non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk will \nbe declared. If non-inferiority is declared at an interim analysis, subsequent analyses of the \nprimary endpoint will be considered sensitivity analyses.\nPeriodically during the course of the study, a blinded assessment of the annual adjudicated \nMACE rate will be made. The number of subjects planned to be enrolled in this study was based \nTMX-67_301\nPage 27 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\non an event rate of 2.8%, which was based on limited information. Based on the overall blinded \nMACE rate observed, an assessment will be made to determine whether or not to adjust the \nnumber of subjects planned for enrollment.\nAt the DMC meeting on \n, the 75% interim analysis results based on 468 \nadjudicated MACE for the primary MACE endpoint to assess cardiovascular safety was\nreviewed by the DMC. At the DMC meeting on \n, the DMC informed Takeda that \nthe non-inferiority criterion for the primary endpoint was met at the 75% interim analysis \nconducted in\n. According to the study design, the study should have been stopped and \nthe non-inferiority of febuxostat relative to allopurinol with regard to cardiovascular risk should \nhave been declared. However the DMC recommendation was to continue the trial without \nmodification until the maximum 624 unique events were achieved to further assess all cause \nmortality (which was not a protocol specified endpoint) and CV mortality (which is specified \nonly as a component of the MACE endpoint). Takeda agreed to follow the DMC \nrecommendation and continue the study.\nBased on the group sequential design, the 75% interim analysis will be the primary analysis for \nthe primary MACE endpoint for the purpose of statistical inference. The continuation of the \nstudy to protocol-specified maximum events (624 unique MACE) is for the assessment of all \ncause mortality and CV mortality. The analyses of all cause mortality and CV mortality with and \nwithout death events after discontinuation of treatments will be added to the end of study \nanalysis. An updated sensitivity analysis for the primary MACE endpoint based on 624 unique \nMACE will also be conducted to provide additional supportive evidence for the primary \nendpoint.\n6.13.1 DMC and Independent Statistical Group\nAn Independent Statistical Group (ISG), \n, has been appointed to support \nstatistical activities for all the interim analyses as well as for routine Data Monitoring Committee \n(DMC) reviews. The independent statistician is external to TGRD and will neither be involved in \nthe direct conduct of the study nor be involved in activities related to the adjudication of CV \nevents. Further, the CV adjudication committee (CEC) members are not involved in the conduct \nof any of the febuxostat clinical trials or in the DMC.\nThe blinded data required for the DMC reviews and for the three interim analyses will be sent to \nthe ISG by Takeda. The randomized treatment assignment for each subject will be provided \ndirectly to the independent statistician by the IVRS vendor. The ISG will perform the unblinded \nanalyses and will provide the unblinded results to the DMC directly.\n6.14\nChanges in the Statistical Analysis Plan from the Protocol Analysis Plan\n6.14.1 Amendment 1 \nThere are no changes from the protocol analysis plan.

A similar analysis controlling for the effect of low-dose aspirin was also added.\nIn Section 6.12.2 Secondary Safety Endpoint; an exploratory analysis was added using a \nmultivariate CPH model to identify risk factors for the time to first occurrence of APTC event.\nIn Section 6.12.4 Adverse Events, it was specified that the latest version of the MedDRA coding \ndictionary will be used to summarize adverse events.\nIn Section 6.13 Interim Analyses, the critical values from the Lan-DeMets-O\u2019Brien-Fleming \nalpha spending function to be used for the interim analyses were provided. Subsection, \nSection 6.13.1 was renamed from \u2018Independent Statistical Group\u2019 to \u2018DMC and Independent \nStatistical Group\u2019. The subsection provides details regarding who will be conducting the interim \nanalysis and that the ISG will be independent from the adjudication committee and other study \nrelated activities.\n6.14.2 Amendment 2\nIn Section 4.3, the time from randomization to the occurrence of all-cause death, the time from \nrandomization to the occurrence of all-cause death during treatment, and the time from last dose \nof study medication to the occurrence of all-cause death were added as additional endpoints. In \nSection 6.12.3, survival analysis using the CPH model and Kaplan-Meier plots for these \nadditional endpoints were added.\nIn Section 6.2, the summarization of major protocol violations was clarified.\nIn Section 6.5, an additional summary of concomitant medications that were ongoing at baseline \nor started after baseline was added.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 29 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\nIn Section 6.6, the duration of study participation in days was clarified as the date of last contact \n- date of randomization +1. The summary of adjustments to dosing was also clarified.\nIn Section 6.7.1, clarification was made that the estimate of the tophi resolution rate using the \nlife-table method will be based on the first resolved primary tophus. Additional summaries of \ntophi resolution by the end of Years 5, 6 and 7 were also added.\nIn Section 6.12.3, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking were specified \nas CV risk factors.\nThe planned statistical inference between treatment groups for adverse events, laboratory \nevaluations, and vital signs was deleted from Sections 6.12.4, 6.12.5, and 6.12.6, respectively. \nIn Section 6.13, clarification was added that if non-inferiority is declared at an interim analysis, \nsubsequent analyses of the primary endpoint will be considered sensitivity analyses.\nThroughout the SAP, updates were made to reflect the longer expected duration of the study. \nThis included additional visits and corresponding visit windows added to Table 6.a as well as \nadditional intervals for summarization of premature discontinuations in Section 6.4, of treatment \nduration in Section 6.6, and of gout flares in Section 6.7.1.\n6.14.3 Amendment 3\nIn Section 6.13, language about the primary analysis of the study report was added by the un-\nblinded team (Amendment 3 of this SAP will remain sequestered to the blinded team until \ndatabase lock and un-blinding).\nApproval signature page for the un-blinded team was added on Page 2.\nTMX-67_301\nPage 30 of 32\nStatistical Analysis Plan Amendment 3\n22 February 2017\nCONFIDENTIAL\n7.0\nREFERENCES\n1.
