This Trial Statistical Analysis Plan (TSAP) assumes familiarity with the Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP), including Protocol Amendments. In particular, the TSAP is based on the planned analysis specification as written in CTP Section 7 \u201cStatistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size\u201d. Therefore, TSAP readers may consult the CTP for more background information on the study, e.g., on study objectives, study design and population, treatments, definition of measurements and variables, planning of sample size, randomisation. SAS\u00ae Version 9.2 (or later version) will be used for all analyses.

        "Content": " See statistical changes described in: \u2022 Protocol amendment 3, dated 07 February 2011 (1).  In addition the following changes were not documented in CTP amendments.  Section 7.3.3 of the CTP states:  In-depth analyses will describe the onset, CTCAE grades, duration and clinical consequences of: \u2022 Diarrhoea; \u2022 Nausea and vomiting; \u2022 Rash and acne; \u2022 Worsening of cardiac left ventricular function; \u2022 Worsening of laboratory abnormalities; \u2022 Other AEs that occur with sufficient overall frequency (>10%).  However project defined special grouped-term search categories have not been identified for either worsening of cardiac left ventricular function or laboratory abnormalities as reported adverse events (AEs), therefore in-depth analyses will not be performed as described above. Instead, descriptive statistics are planned for left ventricular ejection fraction which will include worst value on treatment and change from baseline. Furthermore, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be analysed according to Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) standards. Also, dependent on the final sample size, it is possible that all AEs will occur with frequency >10%; thus the other AEs that will be analysed in-depth will be determined pragmatically by the trial team.

In addition, in this trial, the standard AE attribute 'action taken with trial drug' is separated for afatinib and TMZ; the standard condensing rules will be applied for both. The analysis of AEs will be based on the concept of treatment emergent adverse events. That means that all AEs occurring between first administration of trial medication until 28 days after last administration of trial medication will be assigned to trial medication. All AEs occurring before first administration of trial medication will be assigned to \u2018screening\u2019 and all AEs occurring after last administration of trial medication + 28 days will be assigned to \u2018post-study\u2019.

An additional table will be produced of AEs stratified by the attribute maximum CTCAE grade.
