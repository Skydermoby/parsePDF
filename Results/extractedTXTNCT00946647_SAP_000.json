It is structured as Novartis Confidential Page 8 RAP Module 3 28-Oct-2014 CLBH589H2101  \u2022 A draft of Section 9.7 of the clinical study report (CSR) [Statistical methods planned in the protocol and determination of sample size] \u2022 A draft of Appendix 16.1.9 (Documentation of statistical methods).  Appendix 16.1.9 text will contain details of statistical methods and issues that are too long to include in the CSR text. (Appendix 16.1.9 is not mandatory for abbreviated and synoptic reports). It is written in future tense. It will be reviewed and updated (including conversion to past tense) for entry into the CSR after the statistical analysis has taken place. The data will be analyzed by Novartis and/or designated CRO. Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. It is planned that the data from participating centers in this protocol will be combined, so that an adequate number of patients will be available for analysis. Data from the phase Ib and phase IIb parts will be separately analyzed, but presented in the same CSR. Unless, otherwise specified in this document, the same conventions and working definitions will apply to analyses conducted in the two phases of this study. The core CSR, encompassing both phase Ib and phase IIb parts, will be based on a data cut-off corresponding to the time point where all patients from the phase IIb part have either completed 12 cycles of study treatment or discontinued study treatment for any reason whichever comes first. An addendum to the core clinical study report will be provided at the time of completion of the study to summarize and/or list the additional safety and efficacy data as appropriate. Patients who are continuing their treatment at the time of data cut-off and are assessed by the Investigator to have the potential to benefit from their treatment will continue their assigned treatment on a reduced assessment schedule allowing collection and review of safety, efficacy, and survival data.

        "Title": "Study design",
        "Content": " This is an open-label, multi-center, phase Ib/IIb study. The phase Ib part of the study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) of panobinostat administered in a fixed combination of 5-Aza in adult patients with IPSS INT-2 or high-risk MDS, CMML or AML not eligible for HSCT.  The phase IIb part, that will commence once MTD and/or RPIID is established, has a randomized, two arm design and is designed to assess preliminary efficacy of panobinostat (in combination with 5-Aza) at RPIID compared to 5-Aza alone, the current standard of care, and to further characterize safety and tolerability of this combination. In the phase Ib part, patients will receive escalating oral doses of the study drug panobinostat. The starting dose of Panobinostat will be 10 mg and will be administered intermittently (Day 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15) over 2 weeks. As per registered label, 5-Aza will be given subcutaneously (sc) at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 1 week (Day 1- 7). A treatment cycle is defined as 28 Days in duration. Patients should be treated for a minimum of 6 cycles. Study treatment should be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit or until disease Novartis Confidential Page 9 RAP Module 3 28-Oct-2014 CLBH589H2101  progression or unacceptable toxicity is encountered or consent withdrawal whatever comes first. At least 3 patients per cohort must be enrolled. During the phase Ib part, patients will be evaluated for DLT (Section 6.6.1.6 of the protocol) using an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control (EWOC) to guide the dose escalation process.  After completion of a given dose cohort, the decision on the dose chosen for the next cohort will depend on the risk assessment using the Bayesian logistic regression method and a medical review of available clinical and laboratory data. Dose-limiting toxicity will be assessed from the safety data of Cycle 1 for each dose level. Prior to declaring a dose to be MTD, at least 9 evaluable patients need to be treated at that dose level. The MTD is defined to be the highest daily dose of panobinostat given together with 5-Aza in the first treatment cycle in which the probability to produce medically unacceptable, dose limiting  toxicity (DLT) in more than 35% of the patients is less or equal to 25%. The recommended phase II dose (RPIID) will be based on considerations of the MTD estimation process by the adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model, and on an overall assessment of safety taking into consideration tolerability data from subsequent cycles at all the different dose levels tested. As of August 2011, the recommended phase II dose (RPIID) has been determined to be 30 mg of oral panobinostat once daily on day 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15 in combination with azacytidine (5-Aza/Vidaza\u00ae) administered at a dose of 75mg/m2 daily for 7 days). Additional 80 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio into the phase IIb part of the study receiving 30 mg of panobinostat plus 5-Aza (investigational arm) or single agent 5-Aza (active control arm). Single agent 5-Aza will be administered according to the locally approved label (75mg/m2 daily for 7 days). Patients will continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal, whichever comes first. The core clinical study report (encompassing both, the phase Ib and the phase IIb part of the study) will be based on a data cut-off corresponding to the time point where all patients have either completed 12 cycles of study treatment in phase IIb or discontinued study treatment for any reason whichever comes first. An addendum to the core clinical study report will be provided at the completion of the study to summarize and/or list the additional safety and efficacy data as appropriate. Patients who are continuing their treatment at the time of data cut-off for the core CSR and are assessed by the Investigator to have the potential to benefit from ongoing treatment will continue their assigned treatment allowing collecting and reviewing safety, efficacy and survival data. After the data-cut off point for the core CSR, a reduced visit evaluation schedule will be applied. ",

Informative priors for PAN will be derived based on the DLT rate obtained from a similar trial [CLBH589B2102, arm X] with similar populations, formulations, dose regimens and for 5-Aza from publications. The MTD will be assessed during the first treatment cycle. Each cohort will consist of a minimum of 3 patients fully evaluable for therapy-related toxicities over the first cycle of treatment. Posterior probabilities of the DLT from the model will be summarized. Selection of the next dose will be based on these probabilities as well as on other safety and laboratory data. For details please refer to the Post-text supplement 2.  Dose recommendation will be based on posterior summaries for each dose combination and the interval probabilities for underdosing, targeted, excessive, and unacceptable toxicity for intervals. Once updated, the distribution summarizes the probability that the true probability of a DLT for each dose combination lies in 1 of the following categories: \u2022 [0, 20%) under-dosing \u2022 [20%, 35%) targeted toxicity \u2022 [35%,60%) excessive toxicity \u2022 [60, 100%] unacceptable toxicity. Following the principle of EWOC, the recommended dose combination is the one with the highest posterior probability of DLT in the target interval [20%, 35%) among the doses fulfilling the overdose criteria after each cohort of patients: there is less than 25% chance of either excessive or unacceptable toxicity. The maximum inter-cohort dose escalation permitted is 100%. The dose recommended by the adaptive BLRM may be regarded as information to be integrated with a clinical assessment of the safety data observed thus far in determining the next dose to be investigated. In any case, the next dose will not exceed the recommended dose by the BLRM. Cohorts of at least 3 and up to a maximum of 12 MTD evaluable patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation part including at least 9 patients at the MTD. The Bayesian model will be updated prior to additional enrollment under the following scenarios: 1. If the first 2 patients in a cohort experience DLT prior to the enrollment of the 3rd patient enrollment will be halted, the model will be updated, and any new patients will be enrolled at a dose satisfying the overdose criteria, no higher than the current dose level. 2. No additional patients will be enrolled until the current cohort is completed and the model is updated. 3. For cohorts of > 3 patients if the observed number of DLTs exceeds 25% of the currently enrolled patients to that dose level, enrollment will be halted until all patients complete 1 cycle of dosing or experience DLT. The model will be updated to determine the Novartis Confidential Page 13 RAP Module 3 28-Oct-2014 CLBH589H2101  uncertainty about the probability of DLT at each dose level. New patients will be enrolled at a dose level up to the highest satisfying the overdose criteria. Estimation of the MTD will be based upon the estimation of the probability of DLT in cycle 1 in the MTD determining set. Estimation of the RPIID will be based on considerations of the MTD estimation process by the use of the BLRM, together with an overall clinical assessment of safety taking into consideration safety and tolerability data from all cycles. The RPIID could be the same as the MTD, but will not exceed it under any circumstance. Cohorts may be expanded at any dose level (or dose combination) below the MTD for further elaboration of safety parameters as required.

It is deemed that an observed relative improvement of 50% in the composite CR rate (CR or CRi or bone marrow CR) in the investigational arm over the active control arm is clinically relevant in the phase IIb part of the study. Under the assumption that the composite response rate in the active control arm is 17% (estimate based on Fenaux et al 2009a), the following table gives the estimated probabilities of observing clinically relevant improvement , under different values of the true composite CR rate in the experimental arm. The chance of observing a clinically relevant improvement when there is actually no difference in the true composite CR rates between the arms) is estimated to be 23% while the chance of not observing a clinically relevant improvement when there is indeed a substantial difference in the true composite CR rates (true composite response rates in investigational and active control arms are 35% and 17% respectively) is estimated to be 19%. Since there is no hypothesis being tested, a formal power analysis has not been done. The aforementioned estimated probabilities of 23% and 19% are only analogous to the probabilities of type I and type II errors (in the setting of hypothesis testing). These probabilities (as well as, the others shown under [4] in the following table) have been derived by simulating response data using independent binomial distributions for the investigational and active control arms with the probability parameter of the distribution being specified according to the assumed true underlying composite CR rates as shown under [1], and [2] of the table below.

The first day of study treatment is therefore Study Day 1. For example: if the start of study treatment is on 05JAN2010 and the start date of an Adverse Event (AE) is on 09JAN2010, the study day of the AE onset is calculated to have occurred on Study Day 5. If the event or assessment date happens to be before the treatment start date, the calculation will be without \u201c+1\u201d and the resulting day(s) is a negative number. 3.1.8.2 Phase IIb part The study day for safety assessments (e.g., adverse event onset, laboratory abnormality occurrence, vital sign measurement, dose interruption etc.) will be calculated as: Date of the assessment/event - start date of study treatment + 1. The study day for all other, i.e. non-safety assessments/events (e.g., response assessment, disease progression, ECOG performance status, etc.) will be calculated as: Date of assessment/event - randomization date + 1. Example: if randomization date is 02-Jan-2011, start of study treatment is on 05JAN2011, and the date of death is 09JAN2011 then the study day when the death occurred is 8. For events that occur before randomization/first treatment day, the \u201c+1\u201d from the formulas above will be removed and the study day will be a negative number by definition: Study day = Event date - Date of first study treatment/randomization. Note that the day of first dose of study treatment is day 1 and the day before the date of first study treatment is day \u2013 1, not day 0.  Death may be analyzed as a safety or an efficacy variable depending on the context.  If death is analyzed as a safety variable (such as a listing of deaths),  then \u201cstudy day\u201d must be calculated following the rules for safety assessment.  When death is used as an efficacy variable , such as, in the analysis of overall survival or progression-free-survival,  then the non-safety rule must be used.     ",

As an example, when imputing an AE start date results in a date prior to start of study treatment then the AE start date will be set to the study treatment start date. Or for example, if a date is known to be within the trial period and imputation makes it after the last known contact date, the last known contact date will be used.

The most important is the first planned dose (C1D1 for 5-Aza and C1D3 for PAN). Note: for phase I, PAN could be from  10-60mg  2. DOSE CHANGE  Dose Change: To decide whether the dose was changed or not, it must be compared to previous non-zero dose received (and not to the planned dose) Example:            Administration 1: Planned Dose 30 mg, Actual Dose 30 mg (Dose Change = No) Administration 2: Planned Dose 30 mg, Actual Dose 20 mg (Dose Change = Yes) Administration 3: Planned Dose 30 mg, Actual Dose 20 mg (Dose Change = No) Administration 4: Planned Dose 30 mg, Actual Dose 0 mg (Dose Change = No \u2013 e.g. interruption, see below) Administration 5: Planned Dose 30 mg, Actual Dose 20 mg (Dose Change = No)  3.
