Randomization will be stratified based on the following \ncriteria at the time of study entry: \n\u2022 \nBreast cancer therapy / Lymph node (LN) status:  neo-adjuvant therapy / any LN \nstatus versus [vs] adjuvant therapy / LN negative (based on axillary LN dissection, or \nbased on sentinel node [SN] status) vs adjuvant therapy / LN positive \n\u2022 \nHormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] / progesterone receptor [PR]) status:  \nER and/or PR positive vs ER and PR negative \n\u2022 \nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) status:  HER-2 positive \nvs HER-2 negative \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 10 \n \n\u2022 \nAge:  < 50 vs \u2265 50 \n\u2022 \nRegion:  Japan vs Other \nSubjects will receive denosumab 120 mg or matching placebo subcutaneously (SC) \nevery 4 weeks (Q4W; \u00b1 7 days) for approximately 6 months followed by denosumab \n120 mg or matching placebo SC every 3 months (Q3M; ie, every 12 weeks \u00b1 14 days) for \n4\u00bd years (approximately 54 months), for a total treatment duration of 5 years \n(approximately 60 months). As there are approved bone-targeted therapies for the \ntreatment of bone metastasis, subjects who develop bone metastasis will permanently \ndiscontinue investigational treatment, complete the End of Treatment Phase (EOTP) \nvisit, and enter LTFU upon documented evidence of bone metastasis (per central \nimaging analysis or biopsy). For an individual subject, the maximum duration of LTFU \nafter completing the EOTP visit is 5 years (total study duration for an individual subject is \nup to 10 years from the date of randomization). During the first approximate 6 months of \ntreatment, investigational product (denosumab or matching placebo) may be \nadministered Q3W to subjects receiving or scheduled to receive Q3W \nadjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to minimize patient clinic visits and enhance \nadherence to treatment. There must be at least a 3-week interval between \nadministrations of investigational product. All subjects will be required to receive vitamin \nD and calcium supplementation at standard doses (at least 500 mg calcium and \nat least 400 IU of vitamin D), unless documented hypercalcemia develops on study.  \nAfter completing the treatment phase of the study, subjects will then enter LTFU for \napproximately 5 years (60 months) following the EOTP visit. The study requirements \nduring LTFU are different before and after primary analysis data cut-off date. \nSpecifically, before the primary analysis data cut-off date, all subjects (including subjects \nwith documented evidence of bone metastasis) should be followed by clinic visit or \ntelephone contact every 3 months (every 12 weeks \u00b1 14 days) for approximately \n6 months (ie, first 2 visits of LTFU following EOTP) to assess clinical fractures/SREs, \nhypercalcemia of malignancy, breast cancer therapy, concomitant medications, \npatient-reported outcomes [BPI-SF, EQ-5D], disease recurrence status \n(until documented evidence of bone metastasis  [per central imaging analysis or biopsy], \nnot required for subjects with documented evidence of bone metastasis), and survival. \nAll subjects without documented evidence of bone metastasis following the completion \nof the initial 6 month LTFU period should be followed by clinic visit or telephone contact \nevery 3 months (every 12 weeks \u00b1 14 days) to assess clinical fractures/SREs, \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 11 \n \nhypercalcemia, disease recurrence status (until documented evidence of \nbone metastasis [per central imaging analysis or biopsy]), and survival. Subjects with \ndocumented evidence of bone metastasis including subjects whose bone metastasis is \nconfirmed after the initial 6 month (per central imaging analysis or biopsy): following the \ncompletion of the initial 6 month LTFU period should be followed by clinic visit or \ntelephone contact every 6 months (\u00b1 1 month) to assess SREs, hypercalcemia, and \nsurvival. Following the primary analysis data cut-off date, all subjects should complete \nthe EOTP visit and will be followed by clinic visit or telephone contact every 6 months \n(\u00b1 1 month) for survival only. \nA data monitoring committee (DMC) external to Amgen and external to Daiichi Sankyo \nCo., Ltd. will review safety data at regular intervals, as outlined in the DMC charter \n(approximately twice yearly; the start date will depend on subject accrual rates). This \nexternal DMC will conduct 1 interim analysis of efficacy after approximately 367 subjects \nhave developed bone metastasis or died, and approximately 555 subjects have \ndeveloped any disease recurrence or died, whichever comes last. To ensure timely \nconduct of the interim analysis, the interim analysis may be conducted early, as soon as \napproximately 6 months after the sufficient event number has been reached for either \nBMFS or DFS in the full study population, even if the event number for the other \nendpoint has not been reached.  \nThe primary analysis will be conducted after all enrolled subjects have had the \nopportunity to complete 5 years of treatment from study day 1. \n3.2 \nSample Size \nThe sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint, BMFS, and is estimated \nusing EAST 6 or above.  Estimates of the event rates for BMFS and DFS for the target \npopulation are based on (Colleoni et al., 2000) and on recent published and unpublished \ndata, including (Francis et al., 2008, Martin et al., 2005) for the HER-2 negative \npopulation, (Romond et al., 2005, Slamon et al, 2006) for the HER-2 positive population, \n(Howell et al., 2005, Thurlimann et al., 2005) for the population receiving adjuvant \nhormonal therapy, and (Coleman et al., 2014) for the use of adjuvant zoledronic acid in \nstage II-III breast cancer.  Based on the reported event rates, the event rate proportions \nfor disease recurrence in the bone, the viscera, or death reported by (Colleoni et \nal., 2000) and (Coleman et al. 2014), and considering the availability of some breast \ncancer adjuvant therapies, the BMFS rates at three years is expected to be \napproximately 90.5% in the control group. Disease recurrence risk after primary breast \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 12 \n \ncancer treatment can vary over time (Cheng et al, 2012). For DFS, it is assumed that the \ntime to event (death or disease recurrence) in the control group follows a piece-wise \nexponential distribution with a risk of about 5.5% per year for the first 3 years and \n3.2% per year afterwards in the full study population, and a piece-wise exponential \ndistribution with a risk of about 5.6% per year for the first 3 years and 3.7% per year \nafterwards in the postmenopausal subset. It is anticipated that the true hazard ratio of \ndenosumab compared with placebo is 0.83 in the full study population and 0.76 in the \npostmenopausal subset. \nThe primary analysis will be conducted after all enrolled subjects have had the \nopportunity to complete 5 years of treatment from study day 1. With 4,500 subjects, an \nenrollment period of approximately 27 months, the study is estimated to reach the \nprimary analysis data cut-off date in approximately 87 months (ie, 7 years and 3 months) \nfrom the start of enrollment.  \nWith a loss to follow-up rate of 6% per year, for BMFS, if the true hazard ratio is 0.8, the \npower to detect superiority of denosumab over placebo in the primary analysis is \nestimated to be approximately 80%. \n4. \nStudy Endpoints and Covariates \n4.1 \nPrimary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints \nThe primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are listed in Table 1.   \n",

The analysis visit windows defined in Section 12.1.2 will be \nused to assign measurements to the appropriate nominal visit for the analyses. \n5.3 \nStudy Dates \nInformed Consent Date \nThe informed consent date is the date on which the subject signs the informed consent. \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 19 \n \nEnrollment (Randomization) Date \nThe date on which a subject is assigned to one of the treatment arms through the IVRS \nsystem. \nFirst Dose Date \nThe first dose date is the date on which a subject is administered the first non-zero dose \nof IP, required by protocol to be \u2264 8 calendar days after randomization to the study. \nLast Dose Date \nThe date on which a subject is administered her final non-zero dose of IP.   \nPrimary Analysis Data Cut-off Date \nThe date, defined by Amgen, on which all enrolled subjects would have had the \nopportunity to complete 5 years of treatment from study day 1. The primary analysis data \ncut-off date for this study is assigned to August 31, 2017. \nEnd of Treatment Phase (EOTP) Date for a Subject \nThe end of treatment phase date is the date recorded on the End of Treatment Phase \npage of the Case Report Form (CRF) for an enrolled subject.  \nEnd of Study Date for a Subject \nThe end of study date is the date recorded on the End of Study page of the CRF for an \nenrolled subject.  \n5.4 \nStudy Time Intervals \nScreening period  \nThe screening period for a subject is defined as the time from the informed consent date \nto the day of enrollment. This period is required by protocol to be \u2264 4 weeks.  \nOn-Study Period (up to the primary analysis data cut-off date) \nFor the primary analyses, the on-study period for an enrolled subject is defined as the \ntime from the day of enrollment to the end of study date on the CRF (for subjects who \nterminated study before the primary analysis data cut-off date) or the primary analysis \ndata cut-off date, whichever is earlier.   \n5.5 \nSubject Dispositions \nEnrolled \nIndividuals are considered enrolled if they have been assigned a randomization number \nand they have a non-missing date of randomization.  Enrolled individuals are referred to \nas \u201csubjects\u201d. \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 20 \n \nOn-Study (up to the primary data cut-off date) \nFor the primary analyses, subjects are considered on-study during the period between \nthe date of enrollment and the end of study date on the CRF or the primary data analysis \ncut-off date, whichever comes first.   \nExposed to Investigational Product \nSubjects are considered as exposed to IP if they have received one or more non-zero \ndoses of IP.  \n5.6 \nStudy-specific Definitions \nOnsite Clinical Visit  \nIn the treatment phase, onsite clinical visits are determined as the visits at which \nphysical exam and/or vital signs and/or ECOG have been assessed or IP dosing was \nperformed. During LTFU, onsite clinical visits are determined as the visits at which the \ntype of contact is documented as Clinical Visit or Another Physician on the Follow-up \nSurvival Status CRF page.   \nSolitary Lesion (Via Central Imaging Analysis) \nSubjects are considered to have a solitary lesion if there is only a single lesion, \nbone metastasis or extraosseous disease (EOD) lesion, identified by the central imaging \nvendor across all body sites. If the single lesion is inside the bone, the subject is \nconsidered to have a solitary bone metastasis lesion. Otherwise, the subject is \nconsidered to have a solitary EOD lesion.  \nBone Metastasis  \nBone metastasis must be confirmed by central imaging analysis or by biopsy, and it \nincludes any of the following: \n\u2022 \nBone metastasis lesion that is confirmed via central imaging analysis and is not a \nsolitary lesion  \n\u2022 \nSolitary bone metastasis lesion via central imaging analysis [see definition of \n\u201csolitary lesion (via central imaging analysis)\u201d above] confirmed by the \ninvestigator with a positive biopsy unless biopsy is medically contra-indicated  \n\u2022 \nBone metastasis determined by the investigator and confirmed via positive \nbiopsy  \nAny positive skeletal scintigraphy (\u2018bone scan\u2019) (per central imaging analysis) must be \nconfirmed using X-ray, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI), or biopsy evidence of lesions consistent with bone metastasis.

Cytology or biopsy is required for diagnosis of malignant effusion \n(eg, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites) or meningeal carcinomatosis \n(cerebrospinal fluid).  \nLocal-regional findings (see definition below) prior to surgical (\u00b1 radiation) treatment with \ncurative intent are not considered as EOD.  For a subject with local-regional findings \nafter the surgical (\u00b1 radiation) treatment with curative intent, these findings will be \nconsidered as EOD (local-regional disease recurrence) if at least one of them is \nconfirmed by positive biopsy or cytology. For a neoadjuvant subject without surgical \n(\u00b1 radiation) treatment with curative intent, all her local-regional findings will be \nconsidered as EOD (local-regional disease recurrence) if at least one of these findings is \nconfirmed by positive biopsy or cytology.  \nDevelopment of non-breast cancer new primary malignancy will not be considered as \nEOD. \nLocal-Regional Findings  \nDefined as potential development of breast cancer in any soft tissue or skin of the \nipsilateral chest wall; or in the regional lymph nodes, including ipsilateral axillary, \nipsilateral internal mammary, ipsilateral supraclavicular, and/or ipsilateral infraclavicular \nlymph nodes, and/or in the soft tissue of the ipsilateral axilla. Specifically, the local body \nsites include breast and non-bone chest wall. The regional body sites include axillary \nnode, axillary non-nodal, infraclavicular nodes, internal mammary node, intramammary \nnode, supraclavicular nodes, and subpectoral node. \nDistant Disease Recurrence \nDistant disease recurrence is defined as the development of breast cancer in any distant \nsite (including the skin, subcutaneous tissue [other than skin or subcutaneous tissue \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 22 \n \nareas identified above], and the contralateral breast, within others) and/or distant lymph \nnodes (ie, any lymph nodes other than local or regional lymph nodes as defined above). \nIn a word, distant disease recurrence includes all bone metastasis as well as any EOD \nother than local-regional disease recurrence defined above. Development of non-breast \ncancer new primary malignancy will not be considered as distant disease recurrence.  \nBreast Cancer Disease Recurrence  \nBreast cancer disease recurrence includes bone metastasis and EOD defined above.  \nBone Metastasis [including investigator reported events] \nBone metastasis [including investigator reported events] includes bone metastasis \ndefined above and clinically diagnosed breast cancer recurrence in bone, specifically \nincludes any of the following \n\u2022 \nBone metastasis lesion that is confirmed via central imaging analysis and is not a \nsolitary lesion  \n\u2022 \nSolitary bone metastasis lesion via central imaging analysis [see definition of \n\u201csolitary lesion (via central imaging analysis)\u201d above] confirmed by the \ninvestigator with a positive biopsy unless biopsy is medically contra-indicated  \n\u2022 \nBone metastasis determined by the investigator via any diagnostic procedure \nAny positive skeletal scintigraphy (\u2018bone scan\u2019) (per central imaging analysis) must be \nconfirmed using X-ray, CT, or MRI. Evidence of disseminated tumor cells in bone \nmarrow is not sufficient for determination of disease recurrence. Development of new \nprimary malignancy in bone will not be considered as bone metastasis. \nExtraosseous Disease (EOD) [including investigator reported events] \nEOD [including investigator reported events] includes EOD defined above and clinically \ndiagnosed breast cancer recurrence at a body location outside the bone, specifically \nincludes any of the following  \n\u2022 \nEOD lesion that is confirmed via central imaging analysis and is not a solitary \nlesion \n\u2022 \nSolitary EOD lesion via central imaging analysis [see definition of \u201csolitary lesion \n(via central imaging analysis)\u201d above] confirmed by the investigator with a \npositive biopsy or cytology unless biopsy/cytology is medically contra-indicated \n\u2022 \nEOD determined by the investigator via any diagnostic procedure \nLocal-regional findings (see definition above) prior to surgical (\u00b1 radiation) treatment with \ncurative intent are not considered as EOD [including investigator reported events]. For a \nsubject with local-regional findings after the surgical (\u00b1 radiation) treatment with curative \nintent, these findings will be considered as EOD (local-regional disease recurrence) \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 23 \n \n[including investigator reported events] if at least one of them is determined by the \ninvestigator via any diagnostic procedure. For a neoadjuvant subject without surgical \n(\u00b1 radiation) treatment with curative intent, all her local-regional findings will be \nconsidered as EOD (local-regional disease recurrence) [including investigator reported \nevents] if at least one of these findings is determined by the investigator via any \ndiagnostic procedure.  \nDevelopment of non-breast cancer new primary malignancy will not be considered as \nEOD [including investigator reported events] \nBreast Cancer Disease Recurrence [including investigator reported events] \nBreast cancer disease recurrence [including investigator reported events] includes bone \nmetastasis [including investigator reported events] and EOD [including investigator \nreported events] defined above. \nFracture (Vertebral or Non-vertebral Fracture, Prior to Bone Metastasis)   \nOnly fractures occurring before 12 weeks prior to the first bone metastasis are \nconsidered. Fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral) includes fractures, which are \nconfirmed by central imaging analysis, occurring at any site except skull, facial, \nmandible, metacarpus, finger phalanges, and toe phalanges. In addition, fractures \nassociated with high trauma severity (ie, fall from higher than about 20 inches, or severe \ntrauma other than a fall) will be excluded.  \nSkeletal Related Event (SRE) \nA SRE is defined as one of the following: pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, \nsurgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. All such events that occur from 12 weeks \nprior to the first confirmed bone metastasis are considered SRE in this study. \nPathologic Fracture  \nPathologic fractures are those new bone fractures that occur spontaneously in subjects \nwith bone metastases and are not a result of severe trauma (ie, fall from higher than \nabout 20 inches, or severe trauma other than a fall).  Pathologic fractures are identified \nor confirmed by the central imaging vendor. The severity of the trauma will be \ndetermined by the investigator on the CRF. If a fracture is reported by central imaging \nvendor but not in the CRF it will be considered as not due to severe trauma.   \nRadiation Therapy to Bone \nRadiation therapy to bone in subjects with bone metastases includes radiation for pain \ncontrol (including use of radioisotopes), to treat or prevent pathologic fractures, or to \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 24 \n \ntreat or prevent spinal cord compression.  These events will be captured on the CRF.  \nRadiation may be administered over a period of time. Only the start date of radiation will \nbe relevant when counting skeletal events.   \nSurgery to Bone \nSurgery to bone in subjects with bone metastases includes procedures to set or stabilize \na pathologic fracture, or to prevent an imminent pathologic fracture or spinal cord \ncompression.  These events will be captured on the CRF. \nSpinal Cord Compression \nSpinal cord compression events in subjects with bone metastases must be confirmed by \nthe central imaging vendor using appropriate radiographic imaging (eg, myelogram, MRI \nor CT scans), and not due to trauma per investigator\u2019s evaluation. \nHypercalcemia of Malignancy \nClinical events of hypercalcemia of malignancy will be collected on the CRF throughout \nthe study and during LTFU prior to primary analysis data cut-off date.  Hypercalcemia of \nmalignancy is defined in this study as a serum calcium value (albumin-adjusted if \nnecessary) of CTCAE version 3.0 grade 2 or greater (ie, > 11.5 mg/dL) during the \ntreatment phase, and CTCAE grade 2 or greater events recorded on the \nCalcium Abnormalities CRF page during LTFU.   \nBreast Density \nBreast density will be determined based on standard mammography imaging, and \nassessed according to the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) \nclassification of overall breast composition as follows: \n\u2022 \nThe breast is almost entirely fat (< 25% glandular) \n\u2022 \nThere are scattered fibroglandular densities (approximately 25 \u2013 50% glandular)  \n\u2022 \nThe breast tissue is heterogeneously dense, which could obscure detection of \nsmall masses (approximately 51 \u2013 75% glandular) \n\u2022 \nThe breast tissue is extremely dense. This may lower the sensitivity of \nmammography (> 75% glandular). \nPathological Complete Response  \nThere has not been a uniform definition of pathological complete response. In this study, \npathological complete response following the completion of surgery for breast cancer for \nneo-adjuvant subjects is assessed per investigators\u2019 justification based on the evaluation \nperformed by the local pathologist. A complete pathologic response is considered if no \ninvasive or noninvasive residual disease was found in the breast or axillary lymph nodes. \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 25 \n \nResidual Invasive Tumor Size (RITS) \nThere has not been a uniform definition of RITS. In this study, RITS following the \ncompletion of surgery for breast cancer for neo-adjuvant subjects is assessed per \ninvestigators\u2019 justification based on the evaluation performed by the local pathologist. A \nRITS \u201c0 mm\u201d is considered if no residual invasive tumor was recorded in the breast or \naxillary lymph nodes. \n5.7 \nDerived Variables \nBaseline Value \nBaseline value is the latest recorded measurement on or prior to the day of the first dose \nof IP. If a subject doesn\u2019t receive IP, baseline is the latest recorded measurement on or \nprior to the enrollment date. \nChange from Baseline Value \nThe arithmetic difference between a value of interest and a baseline value: Change from \nbaseline value = (value of interest - baseline value) \nPercent Change from Baseline Value \nThe ratio of the arithmetic difference between a value of interest and the baseline value \nto the baseline value multiplied by 100: Percent change from baseline value = [(value of \ninterest - baseline value) / baseline value] * 100. \nSubject Incidence Rate \nThe subject incidence rate for a given event is defined as the number of subjects with \none or more reported occurrence of the event divided by the number of subjects who \nhave the opportunity to report the event.   \nSubject Age at Study Entry \nAge at study entry is defined as the number of whole years from a subject\u2019s birth date to \nthe enrollment date as calculated in the EDC RAVE database. \nTime to Event for Efficacy \nTime interval (days) from the randomization date to the date of occurrence of the event \nor censorship during the given period: \nTime interval = (date of occurrence of the event or \ncensorship \u2013  randomization date) +1 \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 26 \n \nTime to Event for Safety \nTime interval (days) from the first dose date to the date of occurrence of the event or \ncensorship during the given period: \nTime interval = (date of occurrence of the event or censorship \u2013 first dose date) +1 \nLast Assessment Date (Via Central Imaging Analysis) for Bone Metastasis \nDefined as the exam date of the latest imaging record among all the following imaging \nrecords from the central imaging analysis.

The treatment by subgroup interaction \nwill be examined and tested as described in Section 9.5.1.5.  \nThe safety endpoints including all AEs and SAEs, will be analyzed in the following \nsubgroup:  \n\u2022 \nMenopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal) \n7. \nInterim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines \nA DMC external to Amgen and external to Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. will be formed with \nmembers consisting of individuals chosen for their expertise in oncology, bone disease, \nand in statistical methods in clinical trials.  The primary role of the external DMC is to \nprotect the safety of the study participants throughout the study duration.  They will \naccomplish this by periodically reviewing safety and efficacy analysis results in order to \nassess the risk-benefit profile for subjects enrolled in this study.  Access to both safety \nand efficacy data will provide the DMC a broad perspective with which to generate \nrecommendations for appropriate actions. The external individuals serving on the DMC \nwill have access to subjects\u2019 individual treatment assignments. To minimize the potential \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 35 \n \nintroduction of bias, these individuals will not have direct contact with the study site \npersonnel or subjects. Selected Amgen staff may serve as liaisons to the external DMC, \nbut will not be voting members, and will not be unblinded to the results. Members of this \nexternal DMC will include, at a minimum, physicians external to Amgen and Daiichi \nSankyo Co., Ltd., and appropriate statistical representation external to Amgen and \nDaiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.  \nThe data for review are outlined in the DMC charter and agreed to in advance by the \nDMC members.  Unblinded reports for review will be generated by an independent CRO \nthat is external to Amgen as well. The external DMC will convene approximately \ntwice yearly, and the start date will depend on subject accrual rates.  It is recognized that \nthe DMC may feel ethically compelled to recommend early stopping in the event of \noverwhelming efficacy.  The stopping rules are defined as follows:  \n1. There is 1 formal interim analysis after approximately 367 subjects have \ndeveloped bone metastasis or died, and approximately 555 subjects have \ndeveloped any disease recurrence or died, whichever occurs last.  This analysis \nmay be performed as soon as approximately 6 months after the sufficient event \nnumber has been reached for either BMFS or DFS in the full study population, \neven if the event number for the other endpoint has not been reached.  The \ncritical p-values for rejecting the null or alternative hypothesis are listed in \nTable 11.  The multiplicity from testing DFS in the full study population and in the \npostmenopausal subset simultaneously will be adjusted based on a Hochberg \nprocedure (Sakamaki, 2013; Ye et al., 2012). The study could potentially be \nstopped if both BMFS and DFS in the full study population cross their \ncorresponding efficacy boundaries, or if BMFS crosses the futility boundary at the \ninterim analysis.  The other secondary endpoints OS and DRFS will only be \ntested when the study is stopped or at the primary analysis; the same procedure \nas for BMFS will be used to adjust for multiplicity between the interim and primary \nanalysis for each of these endpoints. \n",

Any \nquestionable values or situations will be reported to Clinical Data Management (CDM) \nfor review or confirmation. \n8.2 \nData Handling and Electronic Transfer of Data \nAmgen\u2019s Data Management department will provide all data to be used in the planned \nanalyses. This study will use the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) database, RAVE. All \nlaboratory values will be electronically transferred from the central laboratory to the \nAmgen database. The central imaging vendor will assess the images submitted by \ninvestigators (eg, Mammography, Bone Scan, CT/MRI) and electronically transfer the \ndata to Amgen.  \n8.3 \nHandling of Missing and Incomplete Data \nSubjects may have missing data points for a variety of reasons.  In general, data may be \nmissing due to subject\u2019s early withdrawal from study, a missed visit, or non-evaluability \nof an endpoint at a particular point in time.  For the study of time-to-event endpoints, \nsubjects completing the study and not experiencing an event of interest are considered \ncensored to the event (see Section 5.7).  The procedures outlined below describing what \nwill be done when data are missing may be refined during the blind review of the data.   \n8.3.1 \nMissing Dates \nIncomplete event start dates and concomitant medications start or stop dates will be \nimputed as described in Table 12.  If the start date is complete missing, for AE, default to \nstudy day 1 if the indicator of \u201cDid event start before the first dose of investigational \nproduct\u201d is checked as \u201cNo\u201d; for concomitant medication, assume it started before \nenrollment. If the stop date and the flag for continuing are both missing for an on-study \nevent or medication, assume the event or medication stopped after the end of \nstudy date.  Partial dates will be listed as is on the listings.  \n",

During the first approximate 6 months of \ntreatment, investigational product (denosumab or matching placebo) may be \nadministered Q3W to subjects receiving or scheduled to receive Q3W \nadjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to minimize patient clinic visits and enhance \nadherence to treatment. There must be at least a 3-week interval between \nadministrations of investigational product. All subjects will be required to receive vitamin \nD and calcium supplementation at standard doses (at least 500 mg calcium and \nat least 400 IU of vitamin D), unless documented hypercalcemia develops on study.  \nAfter completing the treatment phase of the study, subjects will then enter LTFU for \napproximately 5 years (60 months) following the EOTP visit. The study requirements \nduring LTFU are different before and after primary analysis data cut-off date. \nSpecifically, before the primary analysis data cut-off date, all subjects (including subjects \nwith documented evidence of bone metastasis) should be followed by clinic visit or \ntelephone contact every 3 months (every 12 weeks \u00b1 14 days) for approximately \n6 months (ie, first 2 visits of LTFU following EOTP) to assess clinical fractures/SREs, \nhypercalcemia of malignancy, breast cancer therapy, concomitant medications, \npatient-reported outcomes [BPI-SF, EQ-5D], disease recurrence status \n(until documented evidence of bone metastasis  [per central imaging analysis or biopsy], \nnot required for subjects with documented evidence of bone metastasis), and survival. \nAll subjects without documented evidence of bone metastasis following the completion \nof the initial 6 month LTFU period should be followed by clinic visit or telephone contact \nevery 3 months (every 12 weeks \u00b1 14 days) to assess clinical fractures/SREs, \nProduct:  Denosumab Statistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 Date:  15 November 2017 Page 11  hypercalcemia, disease recurrence status (until documented evidence of bone metastasis [per central imaging analysis or biopsy]), and survival. Subjects with documented evidence of bone metastasis including subjects whose bone metastasis is confirmed after the initial 6 month (per central imaging analysis or biopsy): following the completion of the initial 6 month LTFU period should be followed by clinic visit or telephone contact every 6 months (\u00b1 1 month) to assess SREs, hypercalcemia, and survival. Following the primary analysis data cut-off date, all subjects should complete the EOTP visit and will be followed by clinic visit or telephone contact every 6 months (\u00b1 1 month) for survival only. A data monitoring committee (DMC) external to Amgen and external to Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. will review safety data at regular intervals, as outlined in the DMC charter (approximately twice yearly; the start date will depend on subject accrual rates). This external DMC will conduct 1 interim analysis of efficacy after approximately 367 subjects have developed bone metastasis or died, and approximately 555 subjects have developed any disease recurrence or died, whichever comes last. To ensure timely conduct of the interim analysis, the interim analysis may be conducted early, as soon as approximately 6 months after the sufficient event number has been reached for either BMFS or DFS in the full study population, even if the event number for the other endpoint has not been reached.  The primary analysis will be conducted after all enrolled subjects have had the opportunity to complete 5 years of treatment from study day 1. ",

Estimates of the event rates for BMFS and DFS for the target population are based on (Colleoni et al., 2000) and on recent published and unpublished data, including (Francis et al., 2008, Martin et al., 2005) for the HER-2 negative population, (Romond et al., 2005, Slamon et al, 2006) for the HER-2 positive population, (Howell et al., 2005, Thurlimann et al., 2005) for the population receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy, and (Coleman et al., 2014) for the use of adjuvant zoledronic acid in stage II-III breast cancer.  Based on the reported event rates, the event rate proportions for disease recurrence in the bone, the viscera, or death reported by (Colleoni et al., 2000) and (Coleman et al. 2014), and considering the availability of some breast cancer adjuvant therapies, the BMFS rates at three years is expected to be approximately 90.5% in the control group. Disease recurrence risk after primary breast Product:  Denosumab Statistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 Date:  15 November 2017 Page 12  cancer treatment can vary over time (Cheng et al, 2012). For DFS, it is assumed that the time to event (death or disease recurrence) in the control group follows a piece-wise exponential distribution with a risk of about 5.5% per year for the first 3 years and 3.2% per year afterwards in the full study population, and a piece-wise exponential distribution with a risk of about 5.6% per year for the first 3 years and 3.7% per year afterwards in the postmenopausal subset. It is anticipated that the true hazard ratio of denosumab compared with placebo is 0.83 in the full study population and 0.76 in the postmenopausal subset. The primary analysis will be conducted after all enrolled subjects have had the opportunity to complete 5 years of treatment from study day 1. With 4,500 subjects, an enrollment period of approximately 27 months, the study is estimated to reach the primary analysis data cut-off date in approximately 87 months (ie, 7 years and 3 months) from the start of enrollment.  With a loss to follow-up rate of 6% per year, for BMFS, if the true hazard ratio is 0.8, the power to detect superiority of denosumab over placebo in the primary analysis is estimated to be approximately 80%.

Fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral) includes fractures, which are \nconfirmed by central imaging analysis, occurring at any site except skull, facial, \nmandible, metacarpus, finger phalanges, and toe phalanges. In addition, fractures \nassociated with high trauma severity (ie, fall from higher than about 20 inches, or severe \ntrauma other than a fall) will be excluded.  \nSkeletal Related Event (SRE) \nA SRE is defined as one of the following: pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, \nsurgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. All such events that occur from 12 weeks \nprior to the first confirmed bone metastasis are considered SRE in this study. \nPathologic Fracture  \nPathologic fractures are those new bone fractures that occur spontaneously in subjects \nwith bone metastases and are not a result of severe trauma (ie, fall from higher than \nabout 20 inches, or severe trauma other than a fall).  Pathologic fractures are identified \nor confirmed by the central imaging vendor. The severity of the trauma will be \ndetermined by the investigator on the CRF. If a fracture is reported by central imaging \nvendor but not in the CRF it will be considered as not due to severe trauma.   \nRadiation Therapy to Bone \nRadiation therapy to bone in subjects with bone metastases includes radiation for pain \ncontrol (including use of radioisotopes), to treat or prevent pathologic fractures, or to \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 24 \n \ntreat or prevent spinal cord compression.  These events will be captured on the CRF.  \nRadiation may be administered over a period of time. Only the start date of radiation will \nbe relevant when counting skeletal events.   \nSurgery to Bone \nSurgery to bone in subjects with bone metastases includes procedures to set or stabilize \na pathologic fracture, or to prevent an imminent pathologic fracture or spinal cord \ncompression.  These events will be captured on the CRF. \nSpinal Cord Compression \nSpinal cord compression events in subjects with bone metastases must be confirmed by \nthe central imaging vendor using appropriate radiographic imaging (eg, myelogram, MRI \nor CT scans), and not due to trauma per investigator\u2019s evaluation. \nHypercalcemia of Malignancy \nClinical events of hypercalcemia of malignancy will be collected on the CRF throughout \nthe study and during LTFU prior to primary analysis data cut-off date.  Hypercalcemia of \nmalignancy is defined in this study as a serum calcium value (albumin-adjusted if \nnecessary) of CTCAE version 3.0 grade 2 or greater (ie, > 11.5 mg/dL) during the \ntreatment phase, and CTCAE grade 2 or greater events recorded on the \nCalcium Abnormalities CRF page during LTFU.   \nBreast Density \nBreast density will be determined based on standard mammography imaging, and \nassessed according to the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) \nclassification of overall breast composition as follows: \n\u2022 \nThe breast is almost entirely fat (< 25% glandular) \n\u2022 \nThere are scattered fibroglandular densities (approximately 25 \u2013 50% glandular)  \n\u2022 \nThe breast tissue is heterogeneously dense, which could obscure detection of \nsmall masses (approximately 51 \u2013 75% glandular) \n\u2022 \nThe breast tissue is extremely dense. This may lower the sensitivity of \nmammography (> 75% glandular). \nPathological Complete Response  \nThere has not been a uniform definition of pathological complete response. In this study, \npathological complete response following the completion of surgery for breast cancer for \nneo-adjuvant subjects is assessed per investigators\u2019 justification based on the evaluation \nperformed by the local pathologist.

The external DMC will convene approximately \ntwice yearly, and the start date will depend on subject accrual rates.  It is recognized that \nthe DMC may feel ethically compelled to recommend early stopping in the event of \noverwhelming efficacy.  The stopping rules are defined as follows:  \n1. There is 1 formal interim analysis after approximately 367 subjects have \ndeveloped bone metastasis or died, and approximately 555 subjects have \ndeveloped any disease recurrence or died, whichever occurs last.  This analysis \nmay be performed as soon as approximately 6 months after the sufficient event \nnumber has been reached for either BMFS or DFS in the full study population, \neven if the event number for the other endpoint has not been reached.

The study could potentially be \nstopped if both BMFS and DFS in the full study population cross their \ncorresponding efficacy boundaries, or if BMFS crosses the futility boundary at the \ninterim analysis.  The other secondary endpoints OS and DRFS will only be \ntested when the study is stopped or at the primary analysis; the same procedure \nas for BMFS will be used to adjust for multiplicity between the interim and primary \nanalysis for each of these endpoints. \nProduct:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 36 \n \nTable 11.

Outliers due to data entry error will be corrected in the database before the before analysis snapshot and database lock.  Outliers that are not due to data entry error will be included in the primary analysis, unless there is sufficient clinical justification obtained prior to unblinding to exclude them.  The validity of any questionable values or outliers will be confirmed.  No valid measurement may be excluded from descriptive or inferential analyses.  However, sensitivity analyses may be conducted to evaluate the impact of extreme values on the data.  Product:  Denosumab Statistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 Date:  15 November 2017 Page 40  ",

Sensitivity analyses for primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed as described in Section 9.5.1.4 to test the robustness of the treatment effects observed. Two-sided p-values will be presented for all the statistical testing.  Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, which includes n (number of non-missing observations), the mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The minimum and maximum will be reported using the same precision as the original measurement.  The mean, median, other selected percentiles, and standard deviation will be reported to one decimal place more than the precision of the original measurement.  For categorical variables, descriptive statistics include frequency and percentage. For time to event variables, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the quartiles (25th percentile and median) of time to event variable for each treatment group, along with 95% confidence intervals (Kaplan and Meier, 1958).  Kaplan-Meier estimates Product:  Denosumab Statistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 Date:  15 November 2017 Page 41  will be presented graphically for each treatment group approximately up to the time point where there are less than 50 subjects in the risk set for both treatment groups combined.

If > 5% of all randomized subjects were stratified incorrectly for 1 or more factors, then a sensitivity analysis using the actual value should also be performed for the primary and key secondary endpoints.      \u2022 Covariate analyses, where covariates are stratification factors, will be based on subject\u2019s actual value, regardless of the stratum that they were randomized to.  \u2022 For subgroup analyses,  \u2212 Analyses will be based on the randomized stratum. \u2212 If the subgroup variable is a stratification factor, sensitivity analyses according to actual value may be needed.

If there are multiple records within a Baseline (BL) window, the record that is the closest to and prior to and including Study Day 1 will be considered as the baseline value.  If there are multiple records within the subsequent visit window, the record that is closest to the day of the planned visit (eg, target day for visit  \u201cWeek 5\u201d = 7 * 5 \u2013 7 + 1; target day for EOTP visit is the end of treatment phase date on the CRF) will be used as the measurement for this planned visit (the nominal visit).  If two observations are the same distance from the target day, use the later one.  For samples that are assessed with different frequencies, a mixture of the windows given in Visit Table will be used. For example, if a parameter is evaluated every 4 week up to week 25 and then every 12 week thereafter, the window of Q4W will be used up to week 25. The window for week 37 will cover study day 183 to 294. From week 49 and onwards, the Q12W window will be used. ",

The BPI-SF captures information on the intensity of pain (pain severity) as well as the degree to which pain interferes with function (pain interference).  The single item, which asks patients to rate their pain \u2018at its worst\u2019, is an exploratory endpoint in this study.  The severity scale, which is comprised of 4 items, and the pain interference scale, which is comprised of 7 items, are also exploratory endpoints in this study.  Evidence for reliability and validity of the BPI-SF has been well documented in cancer patients (Cleeland CS, 1991). The EQ-5D, developed in 1990, is a widely used generic HRQOL instrument that allows for estimation of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY), a requirement for reimbursement dossiers and formulary submissions.  The EQ-5D is comprised of 6 questions.  The first 5 questions address the following quality of life dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression.  Each of these questions has a simple three-category response scale.  The last question is represented by a 20-cm vertical VAS, scored from 0 to 100 asking the patient to \u201cmark your own health state today\u201d (Brooks, 1996). ",

Each question has 3 response choices, listed in order of increasing severity.  The first response choice (\u201cno problems\u201d) is coded as a 1; the second (\u201cmoderate problems\u201d) is coded as a 2; the third (\u201cextreme problems\u201d) is coded as a 3, as indicated on the questionnaire.  In addition to the five variables representing these items, a string variable formed by concatenating the values for the five dimension variables should be included in the database.  For example, if a subject reports as,  2.a. = 2, 2.b. = 1, 2.c. = 1, 2.d = 1, and 2.e. = 2, then string variable \u201cHealth State\u201d would be \u201c21112\u201d.  In total, there are 243 health states.   Value classification for the 243 health states has been calculated in previous studies using regression models.  Parameters estimated by the previous models can be applied to estimate a health state index value for this study using the dimension scores from question 8 a-e and the following set of IF / THEN statements: Calculation of Health State Index  Generalized least-squares (GLS) regression techniques in which the functional form was additive were used to estimate health state index scores from the EQ-5D questionnaire.  The dependent variable Y was defined as 1 \u2013S where \u201cS\u201d is the health state index score.  Besides the intercept, the specification of the remaining independent variables was derived from the ordinal nature of items in the EQ-5D.  Since there are three response choices for each dimension, there are two dummy variables for each dimension.  For example, there are two dummy variables for mobility (MO2, MO3), two dummy variables for self-care (SC2, SC3), two dummy variables for usual activities (UA2, UA3), two dummy variables for pain / discomfort (PD2, PD3), and Product:  Denosumab \nStatistical Analysis Plan:  20060359 \nDate:  15 November 2017 \nPage 66 \n \ntwo dummy variables for anxiety/ depression (AD2, AD3).
