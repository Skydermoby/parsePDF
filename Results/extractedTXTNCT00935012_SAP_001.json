For all other data types, the data will be analyzed as follows:  for analyses at each visit, the missing observations will not be used. Any visit after the subject was discontinued will remain as missing data. For any subject  missing a 12-month visit observation from Study Fx1B-201, if the Day 0 visit observation from theFx1B-303 study is reported, the  Day 0 visit observation from the Fx1B-303 will be imputed for the12-month visit observation for Study Fx1B-201.
