The mothers will receive Fabrazyme treatment as part of the standard of care of Fabry disease and will be followed through the Fabry Registry. Pregnant women who received Fabrazyme at any point during their pregnancy can be enrolled in the study. The mothers will receive Fabrazyme treatment (commercially available) at their currently prescribed dosage regimen as determined by their treating physician. If an enrolling woman is not receiving treatment with Fabrazyme at the Baseline visit, she should start treatment with Fabrazyme between the delivery and Month 1 visit. Approximately 10 mothers and up to 10 infants will be enrolled in this study. ",

There are 3 participation scenarios: mother/infant full participation, mother full participation/infant development only, and mother full participation/infant no participation (see protocol Section 9.1). Whether or not the mother continues to lactate will be assessed at each visit. Breast milk will be collected at Months 1, 3, and 6 immediately prior to Fabrazyme infusion, just after the end of the infusion, and 2 hours after the end of the infusion. Breast milk samples will be analyzed for volume, presence of \u03b1GAL activity, total fat content, and total protein concentration. Blood samples from the mother will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis prior to each breast milk collection. If infant genotyping is performed on the umbilical blood cord sample collected at Baseline visit, a buccal cell sample will be obtained from the mother to rule out contamination of the cord blood sample with maternal DNA. If the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) consent to infant participation, the infant\u2019s growth and development will be assessed. The infant may also be tested for the formation or continued presence of serum IgG and IgM antibodies to r-h\u03b1GAL and for genotype. For the purposes of this study, the mother and the infant will each be considered a study patient. The mother must be enrolled in the Fabry Registry and will be followed using the Fabry Registry assessment schedule and CRFs as well as this study\u2019s CRF. During this study, infants will be evaluated, ie, the infant may be tested for IgG and IgM antibodies to r-h\u03b1GAL at birth and Months 2, 6, and 12 and will be tested developmentally at each visit for 24 months, or until the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) withdraws consent and discontinues the infant\u2019s study participation, the infant is discontinued from the study by the Investigator (see Section 7.3.1), or the study is terminated (see Section 7.3.2). If the mother is no longer lactating, the mother will discontinue this study but continue to be followed in the Fabry Registry. The infant will be followed for development only for the remainder of this 24-month study. ",

The Investigator will be asked to follow-up on all SAEs that were ongoing at the time of withdrawal, termination or completion until resolution, until both the sponsor and investigator agree follow-up is deemed no longer medically necessary or until the patient is lost to follow-up. If any new SAEs are identified during the course of this follow-up of ongoing SAEs, additional follow-up of these new SAEs may be performed. The Investigator and sponsor will determine if the follow-up is clinically warranted and relevant to the evaluation of the safety of the trial treatment or until patient is lost to follow up. The investigator must follow patients with AEs until their condition resolves or stabilizes. Certain conditions that are not expected to resolve, such as metastatic cancer, need not be followed indefinitely by the investigator. All adverse events (including serious adverse events) will be coded to a lower-level term (LLT), preferred term (PT), high-level term (HLT), high-level group term (HLGT), and associated primary system organ class (SOC) using the version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) currently in effect at Sanofi at the time of database lock.
