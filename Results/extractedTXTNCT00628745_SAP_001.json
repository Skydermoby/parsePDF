        "Content": " The Transthyretin-Associated Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS) is a non- interventional, global, multi-center, longitudinal, observational survey open to all patients with Transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis , including both due to TTR variants (ATTRv) and wild-type forms of the disease (ATTRwt), and patients with TTR gene variants (previously referred as mutations) without disease diagnosis. At the inception of THAOS, limited data were available on the natural history of the ATTRv and ATTRwt forms of the disease, including the regional differences in disease expression by TTR variants and non-mutated TTR, and the genotypic-phenotypic relationship in ATTR. The objectives of THAOS are to describe the population of patients affected with ATTR amyloidosis and to enhance the understanding of the disease natural history, including the variability and progression of the hereditary and acquired forms of disease by studying a large and heterogeneous patient population. Survey data may be used to develop new treatment guidelines and recommendations, and to inform and educate clinicians about the management of this disease. The survey can also generate descriptive safety summaries using adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) data in tafamidis-treated patients. AE/SAE data collection in THAOS will be utilized in the post-marketing setting to provide additional information on the safety of tafamidis over the longer term as well as its effect on survival. Additionally, the collection of safety data in THAOS will fulfill part of the post- marketing commitment to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL CCI NIS Protocol B3461001 Statistical Analysis Plan Page 15 of 52   (CHMP) for tafamidis. Specifically, this non-interventional (NI) study is designated as a Post-Authorization Safety Study (PASS) and is a commitment to the European Medicine Agency (EMA). The objectives of THAOS are to describe the population of patients affected with ATTR amyloidosis and to enhance the understanding of the natural history of ATTR amyloidosis, including the variability and progression of the hereditary and acquired forms of disease.  The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) is to support a final study report. Separate statistical analysis plans will be provided for other efforts including but not limited to annual reporting for regulatory requirements, to facilitate reimbursement discussions, and for abstract and/or publication development. Additionally, a separate SAP is available for the B3461029 substudy to evaluate safety and efficacy in transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) patients with variants other than substitution of methionine for valine at position 30 (Val30Met).

The study has been open since 2007 and will continue until Pfizer declares the study complete (currently estimated to be the year 2023) or as long as patients are able to participate, or until they withdraw consent. THAOS does not involve the administration of an investigational agent or other interventions. Patients will continue to receive their current medications and all other standard care for their disease. It is recommended that assessments be conducted at least annually and be recorded in the THAOS electronic data record close to the time they are performed. Treatment with tafamidis or with other disease modifying therapies will be according to the product label with commercially available product or according to protocol-specified requirements if a patient is enrolled in a separate tafamidis interventional study while simultaneously being followed in THAOS.

In addition, pre-baseline retrospective data may optionally be captured. Return visits will be conducted annually (on average) or at the discretion of the survey physician. The reporting window for collecting changes in signs, symptoms, AEs, and new diagnoses is from the last prior visit. A final visit, including collection of AE/SAE information will be performed at the completion of the survey or at the time the patient elects to discontinue, whichever occurs first. For patients enrolled in interventional clinical trials that include open-label tafamidis or other open label investigational products, follow-up in THAOS may continue, but AE data collection and reporting will be addressed through the interventional clinical trial sponsor.
