                "Content": " This is a multicenter, multinational open label long term study, for patients with RA who participated and completed EFC11072, ACT11575, EFC10832, SFY13370, and EFC13752 or for patients from 12 weeks onward with per protocol defined lack of efficacy from EFC10832. Patients, who were randomized in Part B of EFC11072 in a treatment arm subsequently not retained following pivotal dose selection, were also eligible for enrollment.  The 5 previous studies are described briefly below: EFC11072:  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, two-part, dose ranging (Part A) and confirmatory (Part B) study with an operationally seamless design, evaluating efficacy and safety of sarilumab added to methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who are inadequate responders to MTX therapy. The study was completed. In the dose ranging part of the study (Part A), 5 doses (100 mg weekly [qw], 150 mg qw, 100 mg every other week [q2w], 150 mg q2w, and 200 mg q2w) and placebo were tested in combination with methotrexate (MTX).  The confirmatory (Phase 3) portion (Part B) which initially had the same 6 arms (Cohort 1) and then after Phase 3 dose selection (150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w) had 3 arms (Cohort 2: placebo, 150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w ) for 52-week treatment. In EFC11072 Part B, beginning at Week 16, patients with lack of efficacy (defined as less than 20% improvement from baseline on 2 consecutive visits in either TJC or SJC, or with any other clear lack of efficacy based on Investigator judgment) might have started OL rescue therapy with sarilumab 150 mg qw (150 mg qw prior to Phase 3 dose selection; 200 mg q2w after Phase 3 dose selection) in this study. These patients were also eligible to enter LTS11210 study if completed the treatment period. There were 1283 patients who rolled over to LTS11210. ACT11575:  A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active calibrator-controlled study assessing the clinical benefit of sarilumab on top of MTX in patients with active RA who have failed previous TNF-\u03b1 antagonists was terminated by the Sponsor due to administrative reasons with only 16 patients enrolled.  There were 7 patients who rolled over to LTS11210.  EFC10832:  A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy and safety of sarilumab added to DMARD therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are inadequate responders or intolerant to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) antagonists. Patients are randomized into 3 arms (placebo, 150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w) with 24-week treatment. There were 456 patients who rolled over to LTS11210.

Patients are randomized into 3 arms (Tocilizumab \nIV 4/8 mg/k q4w, 150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w) with 24-week treatment. There were 168 patients \nwho rolled over to LTS11210. \nEFC13752:  An Open-label, Randomized, Parallel Group Study Assessing the Immunogenicity \nand Safety of Sarilumab Administered as Monotherapy in Patients with Active Rheumatoid \nArthritis. Patients are randomized into 2 arms (150 mg q2w, 200 mg q2w) with 24-week \ntreatment. There were 111 patients who rolled over to LTS11210. \nPatients may have been exposed with sarilumab for 12 weeks if they were initially randomized in \nEFC11072 Part A or ACT11575; between 2 and 52 weeks, if initially randomized in EFC11072 \nPart B; between 12 and 24 weeks, if initially randomized in EFC10832; or for 24 weeks, if \ninitially randomized in SFY13370 and EFC13752. \nInitially in LTS11210, patients received 150 mg of sarilumab SC weekly as the highest dose \nstudied in EFC11072 Part A. The reduced dose (due to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or an \nincrease in liver enzymes [ALT]), was 150 mg q2w.  Once the dose regimens were selected for the \nPhase 3 studies (150 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w), patients already ongoing in the study at the \nhighest dose were switched to the new highest sarilumab dose 200 mg q2w, as soon as permitted \nby administrative process.  Patients previously assigned to the reduced dose of 150 mg q2w due to \nsafety issue continued to receive 150 mg q2w.   \nThe duration of the treatment period in the study will be at least 264 weeks, or up to a maximum \nof 516 weeks (except in the UK where the duration of treatment will be 264 weeks) descripted in \nProtocol Amendment 9. However, some patients may complete this study with 260 week \ntreatment duration per Protocol Amendment 8 before the approval of Protocol Amendment 9 in \ntheir countries. The total maximum duration of study participation for a patient may be up to 523 \nweeks.  \n\u2022 \n1-week screening period if applicable  \n\u2022 \n516-week maximum treatment period in LTS11210 (for the earliest patients enrolled in \nLTS11210 in 2010 if sarilumab is not commercialized by 2020) \n\u2022 \n6-week follow up period as required per protocol \nPatients will either enter a 1-week screening period after the EOT visit (Visit 1 in LTS11210) in \ninitial studies (for patients from EFC11072 Part A or Part B1 and ACT11575), or enrol directly \ninto the treatment period (for patients from EFC11072 Part B2, EFC10832, SFY13370, or \nEFC13752, the EOT visit in the initial study corresponds to the randomization visit, Visit 1/2 in \nLTS11210). \nAt Visit 2 or Visit 1/2 (Week 0) after confirmation of eligibility, patients will be administered the \nfirst open-label dose of sarilumab at the investigational site and will be observed for 30 minutes \nfor any medical events. At dosing time points occurring outside site visits, sarilumab can be \ninjected by the patients, or by trained caregivers. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n6.0)\nStatistical Analysis Plan  22-Dec-2015 SAR153191-LTS11210 - sarilumab Version number: 3 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 9 Patients will return for the safety follow-up visit 6 weeks after the EOT visit (V49). In case of early treatment discontinuation, patients are required to complete the EOT visit (V49) and to return for the 6-week safety follow-up visit (Visit 50) as well.  The study will be considered completed for a patient at the time he/she completes all the scheduled procedures. An optional 12-week sub-study aiming to evaluate the usability of pre-filled syringe with safety system (PFS-S) will be conducted in some countries. Patients enrolled in LTS11210 at selected sites in those countries may participate in the PFS-S sub-study from Week 24 of the main study after providing written informed consent for the sub-study. However, patients may continue to participate in the main trial without participating in the PFS-S sub-study if they wish. Full details of the PFS-S sub-study are presented in Appendix K. ",

Handling of missing relationship to investigational product of AEs If the assessment of the relationship to investigational product is missing, then the relationship to investigational product has to be assumed and the AE considered as such in the frequency tables of possibly related AEs, but no imputation should be done at the data level. Handling of missing severity of AEs If the severity is missing for one of the treatment-emergent occurrences of an AE, the maximal severity on the remaining occurrences will be considered.

The \u201csafety system\u201d consists of a sharps injury \nprevention feature, which can be described as a sheath that automatically covers the needle once \nthe injection is completed and thus prevents needle stick injury and re-use.  \nCompared to PFS, PFS-S also includes: \n\u2022 \na rigid needle shield that encloses the soft rubber needle shield covering the needle  \n\u2022 \na finger flange with an ergonomic design and a large piston rod \nThe following figures show the unused and used PFS-S. At the end of the injection when the \nplunger rod has been pushed into the syringe as far as it will go, the needle safety shield is \nactivated which can be seen as the syringe is pulled away from the skin. \n \nUnused syringe \nUsed syringe with activated needle safety shield \n \n \n \n(electronic \n \n \n \n6.0)\nStatistical Analysis Plan  \n22-Dec-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210 - sarilumab \nVersion number: 3 \nProperty of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential \nPage 98 \n \n \nStudy design \nThis is a Phase 3, multicenter, worldwide, non-randomized, open-label, 1-arm, 12-week sub-study \nof the LTS11210/SARIL-RA-EXTEND study. The sub-study will only be performed in limited \nsites in selected countries.  \nPatients at participating sites who have been enrolled in the main study (LTS11210) for at least 24 \nweeks and are willing to participate in the sub-study will be enrolled in the sub-study. The entry \ninto the sub-study (V101) will be at any scheduled visit in the main study from Visit 8 (Week 24) \nor after. Sarilumab 150 mg q2w PFS-S or sarilumab 200 mg q2w PFS-S will be used in the \nsub-study to replace the sarilumab 150 mg q2w PFS or 200 mg q2w PFS used in the main study. \nAt the entry into the sub-study (V101), the patients/persons performing injections will be trained \nhow to use the PFS-S, and the sub-study injection diary will be dispensed to replace the patient \ndiary of the main study. All the procedures described in the sub-study are additional to the main \nstudy activities, unless specified to replace procedures in the main study. \nThe patient/person performing each sub-study injection will respond to 3 questions related to \nPFS-S use on the injection diary after each PFS-S injection. A \u201cno\u201d response to any of these 3 \nquestions will be defined as a product technical complaint (PTC). For any PTC, the Investigator \nwill complete a PTC form and will send this PTC form together with the PFS-S that triggered this \nPTC back to the Sponsor according to a predefined process. The patients should be instructed to \nkeep any PFS-S associated with a PTC separately from other PFS-S, so it can be identified when \nreturned to site at the end of sub-study. The sponsor will validate or invalidate the occurrence of a \nproduct technical failure (PTF), which is defined as a PTC that has a validated technical cause. \nFor patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg q2w PFS-S the dose can be reduced to 150 mg q2w \nPFS-S at any time during the sub-study duration if the defined criteria specified in the main \nprotocol for dose reduction are fulfilled.  \nWhen the patients have completed the 12 weeks of the sub-study they will return to the clinic to \ncomplete Visit 102 (V102) in addition to the scheduled main study visit on that day. They will \nswitch back to the main study and continue sarilumab treatment through PFS.  \nIf the patient chooses to end the participation in the sub-study during the sub-study duration but to \ncontinue in the main study with IMP administration via PFS, the V102 should still be completed \nand the patient should switch back to take IMP administration through PFS on and after V102 per \nthe patient\u2019s IMP administration schedule. \nIf a patient discontinues Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) permanently in LTS11210 \nduring the sub-study, he/she should complete all procedures planned for V102 in the sub-study as \nwell as the end of treatment (EOT) and post treatment follow-up visits in the main study (see \nflowchart in main study). \n(electronic \n \n \n \n6.0)\nStatistical Analysis Plan  \n22-Dec-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210 - sarilumab \nVersion number: 3 \nProperty of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential \nPage 99 \n \nStudy objective \nPrimary \nTo assess the usability of the sarilumab pre-filled syringe with safety system (PFS-S) when \nadministered to patients with active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) \nSecondary \nTo document the safety of sarilumab 200 mg q2w PFS-S and sarilumab 150 mg q2w PFS-S. \n \nDetermination of sample size \nThe sample size of this sub-study is based on empirical consideration.

Treatment compliance during the \ntreatment period in the sub-study will be summarized descriptively. \nEfficacy (Device) analysis \nData will be described for the 12 weeks of this sub-study using the safety population. The efficacy \nanalyses will be performed using descriptive statistics and presented by treatment group. \n \nPrimary endpoint \nThe primary endpoint is the number of validated PFS-S-associated PTFs.  \nThe injection diary will include specific questions about PTCs. The person performing each \nsub-study injection will record the answers to these questions in the diary each time he/she \nperforms an injection with a PFS-S. \nThe questions include: \n1. Were you able to remove the cap? \n\u2022 Yes \n\u2022 No \n \n  If no, please describe / explain:  \n2. Was the needle safety system activated?  \n\u2022 \nYes \n\u2022 \nNo \n                If no, please describe / explain:  \n3. Did the safety system entirely cover the needle? \n\u2022 \nYes \n(electronic \n \n \n \n6.0)\nStatistical Analysis Plan  \n22-Dec-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210 - sarilumab \nVersion number: 3 \nProperty of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential \nPage 103 \n \n\u2022 \nNo \n                 If no, please describe / explain:  \nAt Week 12 (Visit 102), the Investigator will review the diary, confirm with the patient whether \nthere are any problems associated with the use of PFS-S and record the responses in the e-CRF.   \nIf the answer is \u201cno\u201d to any of the questions stated in the diary, the patients will be asked to \nprovide further details of the complaint and a PTC form will be completed by the investigator. The \nPTC form and the PFS-S associated with PTC will be sent to the Sponsor following the \npre-defined process. The sponsor will validate or invalidate the occurrence of a PTF. If the PTF is \nruled out, the event is considered as a failed drug delivery (FDD) that is defined as patient\u2019s \nfailure to administer the full dose at a given attempt. \nIn addition, another question will be asked in the diary to confirm whether the person who \nperformed the injection was trained: \n4. Was the person who performed the injection the person who was trained by the site staff? \n\u2022 \nYes \n\u2022 \nNo \nSecondary endpoints \n\u2022 \nNumber of  PTCs  \n\u2022 \nNumber and percentage of patients with PTFs \n\u2022 \nNumber and percentage of patients with PTCs \n\u2022 \nNumber and percentage of patients with FDDs \nSafety analysis  \nAdverse events related to PTC per investigator\u2019s judgment will be summarized by treatment group \nduring the sub-study. If an adverse event reported during the sub-study is considered linked to a \nPTC by the investigator the potential link with the PTC should be specified in AE/SAE verbatim. \nIf a laboratory or ECG abnormality or vital signs finding reported during the sub-study is \nconsidered clinically significant and linked to a PTC by the investigator an adverse event needs to \nbe reported and the potential link with the PTC should be specified in AE/SAE verbatim.  \nInjection site reaction adverse events will be summarized during the sub-study period (that is, \nthose events with start date from the date of first dose of the sub-study to the date of last sub-study \ndose+14 days, but no later than one day before the date of next non-sub study dose). The specific \nsummaries to be performed are described for the main study. \nOther adverse events, such as needle stick, skin irritation, etc, occurring during the sub-study \nperiod will be reviewed manually to evaluate if the events are related to the device. For the events \nrelated to the device but not PTC, a summary table will be provided or event description will be \nprovided in details if only a few events reported. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n6.0)\nStatistical Analysis Plan  \n22-Dec-2015 \nSAR153191-LTS11210 - sarilumab \nVersion number: 3 \nProperty of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential \nPage 104 \n \nNote:  The safety analyses for the sub-study will be limited to the AEs noted above.  Overall AEs, \nlaboratory values, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECG) that occurs for patients participating \nin the sub-study will be described with the main LTS11210 study results.    \n PK analysis \nSerum concentrations of functional sarilumab will be summarized using standard descriptive \nstatistics by visit.  \nFor PK parameters Ctrough, estimates and 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric means (Day 85 versus \nDay 1) will be provided using a linear fixed effects model on the log-transformed data. Serum \ntrough concentrations of functional sarilumab will be evaluated in patients on stable dose of \nsarilumab at V101 (D1) before using the PFS-S. Patients are considered to be on stable dose of \nsarilumab at V101 (D1) if they receive the same dose of sarilumab without treatment interruption \nfor at least 24 weeks in LTS11210 prior to V101. Patients changing dose during the 12 week \nsub-study will be excluded from the Ctrough analyses \nInterim analysis \nNo interim analysis is planned for this sub-study. \n \n(electronic \n \n \n \n6.0)\n",
