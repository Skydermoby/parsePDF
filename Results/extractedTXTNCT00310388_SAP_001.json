The primary efficacy variable is the percentage change in the monthly seizure rate from the baseline phase to the open-label treatment phase.

Baseline for the open-label extension study corresponds to the assessments performed at the last visit of the Maintenance phase (Visit 9) \nof Study VRX-RET-E22-302 for all patients. The final, baseline eligibility assessment for the open-label extension study, including \nobtaining informed consent and dispensing open-label study medication will be performed at the last visit of the Transition phase (Visit 11) \nof Study VRX-RET-E22-302. \n2. Study Visit 1 will have a window range of \u00b13 days. After Study Visit 1, all remaining study visits will have a window range of 7 days around \nthat visit day to accommodate individual schedules.  Each study month will be defined as 30 calendar days. If a patient visit occurs outside \nthe visit window, the study clinical monitor (CRA) should be notified and the reason for the deviation noted. An attempt should be made to \nensure that the patient returns for subsequent visits on schedule using the last visit of the Transition phase (Visit 11) of Study VRX-RET-\nE22-302, which corresponds to the final, Baseline eligibility visit for the open-label extension study. \n3. This open-label extension study will be continued until retigabine is approved and commercially available, or until the program s \ndiscontinued, followed by a 3-week tapering period and a 30 day post-study period for collection of adverse events. After the first year, the \nstudy visits will occur every 4 months (3 visits per year). After the first year, the assessments for the first 2 study visits of each year (e.g. \nVisits 6, 7, 9 and 10) will be identical, and the assessments for the last study visit of each year (e.g. Visits 8 and 11) will be identical. \n4. All patients who discontinue early from study treatment during the open-label extension study will have their study medication tapered over \na 3-week period, reducing their daily dose by one third per week, and then return for a final visit. Patients who discontinue early during the \nfirst year of the open-label extension study will complete all assessments and evaluations scheduled for Study Visit 5. Patients who \ndiscontinue early during the second year of the open-label extension study will complete all assessments and evaluations scheduled for \nStudy Visit 8. Patients who discontinue early during the third year of the open-label extension study will complete all assessments and \nevaluations scheduled for Study Visit 11. Also, all adverse events should be followed and collected up to until 30 days after administration \nof the last dose of study drug (end of study drug taper-off). \n5. Supine and standing blood pressure, heart rate. \n6. In addition to the scheduled pregnancy tests, a pregnancy test should be performed during the study whenever a woman\u2019s menstrual \nperiod is 5 days late. \n7. The AUA Symptom Index and the PVR bladder ultrasound will only be performed during the first year of the open-label extension study \n(Visits 1, 2, and 5). \n8. Dispensation of study medication is not applicable at the final study visit, if a patient has discontinued early or completed the open-label \nextension study. \n9. Study visits added per FDA comments that the open label extension trial should include more frequent hematological monitoring. These \nare now in-line with the hematological monitoring frequencies per the VRX-RET-E22-302, double-blind trial. \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n9\nValeant Pharmaceuticals North America Statistical Analysis Plan VRX-RET-E22-304 Version 2.0 [Final]  Filename: 87272_304_SAP_v2_final  page 9 of 148  ",
