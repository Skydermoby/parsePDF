Study Objectives\n2.1.1. Primary Objective\n\uf0b7\nTo assess TBE antibody persistence at yearly intervals from approximately 3 years \n(38 months) to 10 years (118 months) after the first booster vaccination (as \napplicable) with either FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior or FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml by \nmeans of NT (according to Adner et al., 2001)1 and ELISA [IMMUNOZYM FSME \nImmunoglobulin G (IgG)].\nThis objective is relevant to all applicable visits 1-3 and 6-10.\n2.1.2. Secondary Objective\n\uf0b7\nThe secondary objective on immunogenicity was to assess the antibody response to a \nsecond booster vaccination with either FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior or \nFSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml administered in the present study, by means of ELISA and \nNT.\nThis objective is applicable to postbooster blood sample draw visit (visit 5 only).\nPPD\nPPD\nProtocol B9371021 (PF-06830414) Statistical Analysis Plan\nPage 5\n\uf0b7\nThe secondary objective on safety was to assess the safety of FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml \nJunior or FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml after administration of the second booster \nvaccination in the present study.\nThis objective is applicable to injection site reactions and systemic events after receiving the \n2nd booster dose at visit 4.\n2.2. Study Design\nThis is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, follow-up, phase IV study in healthy children, \nadolescents and young adults who previously received the first booster vaccination with \neither FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior or FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml in Study 700401. A brief \ndescription of all precedent studies are provided below.\n2.2.1. Precedent Studies\nStudy 209 was a multicenter, open-label safety study designed to investigate the safety of \nthree vaccinations with five consecutive vaccine lots of 0.25ml (1.2 \u03bcg [\u00b115%] TBEV \nantigen dose) FSME-IMMUN NEW in 2400 healthy children and adolescents aged 1 to \n15 years. Immunogenicity was also investigated in a subgroup of 400 (planned population) \nsubjects from four study centers. Blood samples drawn in Part A of the study (ie, at baseline \nand Day 21-35 after the second vaccination) and Part B (35-42 days after the third \nvaccination) were all tested for ELISA and NT. \nStudy 700401 was designed as a follow-up Phase 4 (Phase 3b in Poland) study in healthy \nchildren and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years to investigate seropersistence of TBE antibodies \napproximately 24, 34, 46 and 58 months after completion of the primary immunization in \nstudy 209 (3 vaccinations administered at Months 0, 1 and 6) with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 mL \n(subjects were aged 1 to 15 years at the time of their first vaccination).\n2.2.2. Study Subjects Selection and Process\nA total of 179 children, adolescents and young adults who received their first TBE booster \nvaccination in the precedent Study 700401 were enrolled to assess seropersistence of TBE \nantibodies at yearly intervals from approximately 3 years (38 months) to 10 years \n(118 months) after the first booster vaccination (as applicable), as well as antibody response \nto a second booster vaccination with either FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior or \nFSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml according to the subject\u2019s age.\nSubjects who may not be protected against TBE for an entire further tick season (NT titer \n\u226420 and / or ELISA value < 126 VIE U/ml) will be invited to receive the second booster \nvaccination at either the 40, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, or 120 month time point.\n",
