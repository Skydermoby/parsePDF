Upon regulatory approval for the treatment of TTR-FAP in their respective country and access to prescription tafamidis, subjects may be withdrawn from the study.  Such subjects will be considered study completers. The decision to withdraw subjects in a country will be done in consultation between the investigator and the sponsor.

The data after that  PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 Protocol B3461023 Statistical Analysis Plan  point will be summarized using descriptive statistics only and for the T-T and P-T groups will not be compared and no p value will be produced. Separate analyses will be conducted using both measurements of baseline, at study start and at active treatment start as specified above.  Due to the 18 month length of Fx-005 and the fact that many of the outcomes are measured annually, the measurements aren\u2019t at the same time points (for example, 3 years of active treatment); this disparity of treatment schedules will not allow a direct comparison of the subjects\u2019 change from baseline on active treatment, at any time point after the parent trials; therefore, just descriptive statistics will be reported for the outcomes measured annually. For the non V30M subjects, a repeated measures analysis of covariance model with change from baseline as the dependent variable, an unstructured covariance matrix, month as fixed effect, baseline as covariate and subject as a random effect in the model will be used to estimate the LSMeans and confidence intervals.  A sensitivity analysis will also be conducted using the model shown above however, without baseline as a covariate.  ",

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 Protocol B3461023 Statistical Analysis Plan  The following measures will be analyzed using the methods described above for continuous outcomes in Section 8.1.1:  NIS-LL, TQOL, Karnofsky Performance Scale Index.   These analyses will be provided by treatment group and by TTR mutation. The assessment of subject ambulation will be analyzed using the methods described above for categorical measures in Section 8.1.2.  Due to the fact that there are two substantially different versions of the CRF page, the data will be summarized three ways: for the original CRF, for the revised CRF and for the combined recoded data.  In addition, shift tables will be presented showing the distribution of subjects with a change in ambulation based on the combined recoded data.  Finally, if there are sufficient numbers of subjects who demonstrate a change in ambulation stage, , then Kaplan-Meier estimates will be computed for the time to the next ambulatory stage  (see details in Appendix 1.8).
