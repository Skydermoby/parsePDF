Medical History, Physical Exam (including weight \nand height), Pregnancy test, Imaging and Clinical Labs (Chemistry, Antithrombin, and Hematology) are only required once (at Screening or Baseline visit if Screening is\nwithin 48 hours of the Baseline visit).\nRepeated evaluations at Baseline are at the investigator\u2019s discretion.  Antithrombin activity is evaluated only once during the Dose \nAdjustment and PD Phases.\n4.\nThe PD phase will last for up to 7 days in order to complete two PD samples (anti-Xa). Subjects will be randomized through a randomization scheme as assigned by the \nelectronic system, IMPALA, into two different sampling windows: 1 to 3 h and 5 to 8 h or 3 to 5 h and 8 to 12 h until at least 50 subjects provide viable PD Phase anti-Xa \nvalues. The plasma sampling times can be spread over the duration of the PD Phase if necessary to avoid blood volume shifts. Lab samples for anti-Xa and anti-IIa levels\nwill be sent to Central (C) lab only. All plasma samples should be drawn within the assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, record the actual time the \nsample is drawn and repeat it when appropriate at the correct time, if possible. Plasma samples drawn during the dose-adjustment phase and follow up phase that deviate \noutside the 4 \u00b1 1 hr window cannot use the anti-Xa reference range, 0.5-1.0 IU/mL, and should be repeated the next day for both central and local labs. The actual dosing \ntime prior to the repeat plasma sample draw and the actual time of the repeat sample draw must be recorded. NOTES: 1) Plasma samples drawn for anti-Xa and anti-IIa must \nnot be hemolyzed.  All precautions must be made to ensure that the plasma samples are not hemolyzed.  2) For non-cancer patients, if study medication is stopped prior to \n3 months of treatment per the ACCP Guidelines, no further anti-Xa or anti-IIa sampling is required while study medication is not taken.\n5.\nFor subjects whose platelet counts unexpectedly fall below 50,000/mm3, HIT antibody will be assessed. If the HIT antibody is positive, the subject must be discontinued.  \nAntithrombin levels are to be performed once within 1 week post-diagnosis of VTE and at each study visit when anti-Xa samples are drawn.  Anti-Xa levels will be measured\nat 4 hours post-dose (\u00b11 hour) daily for up to 7 days (Days 1-7) during Dose Adjustment Phase. The first anti-Xa level may be drawn after the first, second or third doseper \nInvestigator judgment during Dose Adjustment Phase.  After any dose adjustment, anti Xa should be re drawn after the first, second or third dose or per institutional standard.  \nIf the target range is not achieved within the 7 day period, the subject\u2019s study participation will be terminated. These assessments are mandatory at Visits 5, 6 and 7 during \nfollow-up Phase. The Anti-Xa samples will also be collected at 4 hours post-dose (\u00b11 hour) at each visit during follow-up Phase.  All plasma samples should be drawn within \nthe assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, record the actual time the sample is drawn). . Indications for monthly anti-Xa checks include but are not\nlimited to a new compromising event change in renal function, significant weight change and suspected lack of treatment adherence. Lab samples collected for anti-Xa \nlevel during Dose Adjustment Phase and Follow-up Phase will be sent to both Local (L) and Central (C) labs. In addition, central lab samples for anti-Xa levels will also \nbe used for anti-IIa measurement.  See item 4 above for anti-Xa samples to be drawn in the PD Phase.\n6.\nTelephone contacts are weekly following discharge from the hospital through the end of the study except weeks with clinical visits, ie, Visits 5, 6 and 7 per protocol).\n7.\nThe same imaging modality should be performed from the Screening/Baseline visit as the EOS Visit or at an Unscheduled Event visit for recurrent or new VTEs. Note: The \nEOS visit (per protocol) imaging is not required if a previous visit imaging has demonstrated resolution of a clot.\n8.\nImaging must be performed at an unscheduled visit if there is suspicion of a recurrent or new VTE; otherwise images are not required but can be performed at the discretion\nof the investigator as per standard of care.\n9.\nClinical laboratory testing should be performed per the investigator\u2019s discretion.\n10.

Study drug will be dispensed to subjects according to their dosing requirements. Cancer patients will be dispensed study drug for the entire 3 months, whereas non-cancer \npatients will be dispensed study drug for the appropriate treatment period for them according the ACCP Guidelines of 6 weeks to 3 months. Non-cancer patients will, \nhowever, be required to complete all remaining study visits, but no anti-Xa or anti-IIa plasma samples will be required once the non-cancer patients stop study drug.\n12. During the Dose Adjustment Phase and Follow-Up Phase, if a plasma sample for anti-Xa is drawn outside the 4 hour (+/- 1 hour) window, the plasma sample for anti-Xa must \nbe re-drawn the next day within the correct window and sent to the Local Lab and Central Lab.  If this occurs, an Unscheduled Visit must be conducted to redraw the anti-Xa \nplasma samples.  The actual dosing time prior to the repeat plasma sample draw and the actual time of the repeat sample draw must be recorded in the CRF.\n13. Unscheduled Events are bleeding or VTE events that require an Unscheduled Event visit.  Unscheduled visits are conducted for any other reason.\n14.

For these indications, dalteparin has an acceptable safety profile. \nFurther information regarding dosage, safety profile, etc., can be found in the current US\nPackage Insert or local Summary of Product Characteristics, which will serve as the\nInvestigators\u2019 Brochure for this study.\nMultiple retrospective studies have shown that cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is a \nsignificant entity previously under recognized and under treated.2-9  When compared to\nsubjects without cancer, cancer subjects are far more prone to develop VTE; in fact, VTE\nmay represent the initial presenting finding for an otherwise occult cancer.10 When\ncompared to cancer-free subjects with symptomatic VTE, cancer subjects with VTE are\nmore prone to recurrence and to treatment-related bleeding complications.\nThe CLOT study [\u201cRandomized Comparison of Low Molecular Weight Heparin\n(Dalteparin, Fragmin\u00ae) versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy for Long Term Anticoagulation in\nCancer Subjects with Venous Thromboembolism\u201d] was the first multinational prospective\nrandomized clinical trial in a general cancer population to show the superiority of\nLMWH therapy for secondary prophylaxis compared to standard of care therapy using\nvitamin K antagonists (oral anticoagulants [OAC]) in cancer subjects with confirmed\nsymptomatic lower extremity DVT, PE, or both.1 However, the CLOT study did not include\npediatric subjects and there is limited information in the literature regarding the proper\ndosing of dalteparin for treatment of VTE in pediatric subjects with cancer.\nThe use of LMWHs has been evaluated in several published pediatric studies. In a\n1996 report, Massicote et al.,11 described their evaluation of enoxaparin in 25 pediatric\nsubjects in Canada either with VTE or at risk of VTE, and deemed by their physicians to be\nat risk of bleeding with unfractionated heparin.  It was observed that an inverse relationship\nexisted between the subject\u2019s age (correlated with body weight) and dosing required to\nachieve effective anti-Xa inhibition, with \u201cnewborns\u201d requiring a greater than 50% increased\ndose per kg (perhaps due to a larger volume of distribution [Vd]).\nLikewise, in a 1999 report by Nohe et al.,12 doses of dalteparin in 48 children were shown to\nbe effective (129\u00b143 anti-Xa International Units (IU)/kg, q24h for treatment; 92\u00b152 anti-Xa\nIU/kg, q24h for prophylaxis as recommended in the 7th ACCP Guidelines15), with higher\ndosing required for younger children to achieve the same target anti-Xa level. Risk factors\nfor thrombosis in this cohort included the presence of carcinoma in some of the children.\nDosing with enoxaparin in 173 pediatric thrombosis subjects was also evaluated by Dix et al.\nand reported in 2000.13 The authors concluded again, as above, that the use of LMWH in\nchildren was \u201c\u2026a safe and effective form of anticoagulation\u201d.\nThe combination of the published data and recognition that for more than 10 years children \nworldwide have been treated with LMWH for VTE, outside of the approved indication,\nsupports the safety of the recommended doses of LMWH in children.\nFRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)\nFinal Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016\nPage 25\n4. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS\nThe primary objective of this study is to:\n\uf0b7\nTo determine the PD profiles for treatment doses of dalteparin in pediatric\nsubjects of different ages with or without cancer and VTE, using Anti-Xa levels and\na population PD analysis methodology;\n\uf0b7\nTo determine the median dose (IU/kg) required to achieve therapeutic Anti-Xa levels\n(0.5-1.0 IU/mL) based on subject age and weight.\nSecondary objectives will be:\n\uf0b7\nTo assess the proportion of major bleeding events during dalteparin treatment;\n\uf0b7\nTo assess the proportion of minor bleeding events during dalteparin treatment;\n\uf0b7\nTo explore the proportion of objectively documented new or progressive\nsymptomatic VTE during dalteparin treatment;\n\uf0b7\nTo explore the relationships of recurrent VTE and major bleeding events with anti-Xa\nlevels, if data permits;\n\uf0b7\nTo explore the proportions of subjects with progression, regression, resolution or no\nchange in the qualifying VTE during dalteparin treatment;\n\uf0b7\nTo describe the overall safety profile of dalteparin in pediatric subjects of different\nages with or without cancer and VTE.\n\uf0b7\nTo assess the proportion of subjects achieving an anti-Xa therapeutic range of 0.5 to \n1.0 IU/mL during the Dose Adjustment Phase.\nPrimary Endpoints:\n\uf0b7\nDetermine the median dose of dalteparin (IU/kg) associated with the achievement of \nthe therapeutic Anti-Xa level (0.5-1.0 IU/mL) among subjects that achieved their \ntherapeutic Anti-Xa level during the dose adjustment phase, for each age cohort \ngroup;\n\uf0b7\nAnti-Xa activity versus time profile following dalteparin treatment will be explored \nusing a population PD analysis methodology. Population PD parameters such as \nclearance, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant will be estimated based on \nAnti-Xa levels collected during dose adjustment phase, PD phase and follow-up \nphase. Age and other relevant covariates will be explored in the population \nPD analysis.\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\uf0b7\nProportion of subjects achieving an Anti-Xa therapeutic range of 0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL \nduring the Dose Adjustment Phase (up to 7 days);\n\uf0b7\nProportion of subjects with objectively documented, new or progressive symptomatic \nVTE during dalteparin treatment utilizing the same objective technique performed at \nBaseline;\n\uf0b7\nTime to first episode of symptomatic recurrent VTE during dalteparin treatment;\n",

                "Content": "This protocol implements a post-approval clinical commitment originally with Eisai Inc and now between Pfizer Inc., and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relating to thedalteparin s NDA 20-287/S-035, \u201cfor the extended treatment of symptomatic venous thromboembolism [VTE (proximal deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and/or pulmonaryembolism [PE])] to reduce recurrent VTE in subjects with cancer\u201d, hereafter referred toas the \u201cCLOT indication\u201d.1 The Agency indicated that a post-approval study toinvestigate the safety and efficacy of dalteparin in a pediatric cancer population requiringanticoagulation was warranted. Following a Type C Meeting with FDA on October 5, 2015, this study now includes both pediatric patients with and without cancer.This phase II pharmacodynamic (PD) study is intended to provide information to guide the conditions under which dalteparin may be used for the acute treatment and secondary prophylaxis of recurrent VTE in children with or without cancer. Pharmacodynamics ofdalteparin is being measured only using the Anti-Factor Xa (Xa) activity and not the druglevel in the body. In this study, the PD effect (anti-Xa level) is used as a surrogate for thetime course of drug exposure because 1) analytical difficulty in measuring the drug in plasmaand 2) the instantaneous drug effect on anti-Xa level. Hence, the study is onlycharacterizing the PD of dalteparin in pediatric subjects with and without cancer.Figure 1.Chemical Structure of Dalteparin Sodium",

                "Content": "Dalteparin sodium (Fragmin\u00ae) is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), produced by degradation of heparin, a member of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family of biological entities found in the intestinal mucosa. Dalteparin was first approved in the US inDecember 1994 for primary prophylaxis of DVT in subjects undergoing abdominal surgery. This was followed by approvals for primary prophylaxis of DVT in subjects undergoinghip surgery and in medical subjects with severely restricted mobility during acute illness. Dalteparin sodium is also indicated for the prophylaxis of ischemic complications inunstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, when concurrently administered with aspirin therapy.FRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)\nFinal Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016\nPage 24\nDaltaperin was approved in 2006 for the extended treatment of VTE in adult patients (age\n\uf0b318 years) with cancer. For these indications, dalteparin has an acceptable safety profile. \nFurther information regarding dosage, safety profile, etc., can be found in the current US\nPackage Insert or local Summary of Product Characteristics, which will serve as the\nInvestigators\u2019 Brochure for this study.\nMultiple retrospective studies have shown that cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is a \nsignificant entity previously under recognized and under treated.2-9  When compared to\nsubjects without cancer, cancer subjects are far more prone to develop VTE; in fact, VTE\nmay represent the initial presenting finding for an otherwise occult cancer.10 When\ncompared to cancer-free subjects with symptomatic VTE, cancer subjects with VTE are\nmore prone to recurrence and to treatment-related bleeding complications.\nThe CLOT study [\u201cRandomized Comparison of Low Molecular Weight Heparin\n(Dalteparin, Fragmin\u00ae) versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy for Long Term Anticoagulation in\nCancer Subjects with Venous Thromboembolism\u201d] was the first multinational prospective\nrandomized clinical trial in a general cancer population to show the superiority of\nLMWH therapy for secondary prophylaxis compared to standard of care therapy using\nvitamin K antagonists (oral anticoagulants [OAC]) in cancer subjects with confirmed\nsymptomatic lower extremity DVT, PE, or both.1 However, the CLOT study did not include\npediatric subjects and there is limited information in the literature regarding the proper\ndosing of dalteparin for treatment of VTE in pediatric subjects with cancer.\nThe use of LMWHs has been evaluated in several published pediatric studies. In a\n1996 report, Massicote et al.,11 described their evaluation of enoxaparin in 25 pediatric\nsubjects in Canada either with VTE or at risk of VTE, and deemed by their physicians to be\nat risk of bleeding with unfractionated heparin.  It was observed that an inverse relationship\nexisted between the subject\u2019s age (correlated with body weight) and dosing required to\nachieve effective anti-Xa inhibition, with \u201cnewborns\u201d requiring a greater than 50% increased\ndose per kg (perhaps due to a larger volume of distribution [Vd]).\nLikewise, in a 1999 report by Nohe et al.,12 doses of dalteparin in 48 children were shown to\nbe effective (129\u00b143 anti-Xa International Units (IU)/kg, q24h for treatment; 92\u00b152 anti-Xa\nIU/kg, q24h for prophylaxis as recommended in the 7th ACCP Guidelines15), with higher\ndosing required for younger children to achieve the same target anti-Xa level. Risk factors\nfor thrombosis in this cohort included the presence of carcinoma in some of the children.\nDosing with enoxaparin in 173 pediatric thrombosis subjects was also evaluated by Dix et al.\nand reported in 2000.13 The authors concluded again, as above, that the use of LMWH in\nchildren was \u201c\u2026a safe and effective form of anticoagulation\u201d.\nThe combination of the published data and recognition that for more than 10 years children \nworldwide have been treated with LMWH for VTE, outside of the approved indication,\nsupports the safety of the recommended doses of LMWH in children.\nFRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)Final Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016Page 25",

This Phase II PD study isintended to provide information to guide the conditions under which dalteparin may be usedfor the treatment of acute and secondary prophylaxis of VTE in children with or without cancer. Subjects will be enrolled into the following five age groups:\uf0b70 to < 8 Weeks;\uf0b7\u22658 Weeks to < 2 Years;\uf0b7\u22652 Years to < 8 Years;\uf0b7\u22658 Years to < 12 Years;\uf0b7\u226512 Years to < 19 Years.The target enrollment is a total of 50 subjects who have viable PD profiles after treatment doses of dalteparin.Dose Adjustment Phase:The Dose Adjustment Phase will begin following the first dose and continue for up to7 days. During the Dose Adjustment Phase, doses are adjusted according to Anti-Xa levels. The starting doses for the five age groups are as follows: \uf0b70 to <8 weeks \u2013 125 IU/kg;\uf0b7\u22658 weeks to < 2 years\u2013 150 IU/kg;\uf0b7\u22652 years to <8 years \u2013 125 IU/kg;\uf0b7\u22658 years to <12 years \u2013 125 IU/kg and\uf0b7\u226512 years to <19 years \u2013 100 IU/kg.The first Anti-Xa plasma sample drawn after the initial dose of study drug treatment should be conducted 4 hours \u00b11 hour after the first, second or third dose of study medication per Investigator judgment. Subsequent Anti-Xa plasma samples conducted following dose adjustments will also be drawn at 4 hours \u00b11 hour post-dose, after the first, second or third dose of study medication per Investigator judgment. Doses will be adjusted in increments or decrements of 25 IU/kg in order to achieve target anti-Xa levels (0.5-1.0 IU/mL). All plasma samples should be drawn within the assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, record the actual time the sample is drawn. Plasma samples drawn during the Dose-Adjustment Phase and Follow-Up Phase that deviate outside the 4 \u00b1 1 hr window cannot use the anti-Xa reference range, 0.5-1.0 IU/mL, and should be repeated the next dayfor both central and local labs. The actual dosing time prior to the repeat plasma sample draw and the actual time of the repeat sample draw must be recorded.PD Phase:Subjects completing the Dose Adjustment Phase will enter into the PD Phase. Dalteparin sodium will be administered subcutaneously every 12 hours \u00b11 hour (no less than 8 hours between doses) with the maintenance therapeutic dose from the Dose Adjustment Phase.  FRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)Final Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016Page 28However, if a dose is not able to be delivered every 12 hours \u00b11 hour, administer the dose (no less than 8 hours between doses) and record the actual dosing time.  The PD Phase willlast for 1 to 7 days in order to complete two PD samples for each subject (for the central lab, only).Subjects from each age group will be randomized according to a randomization scheme provided by the electronic system, IMPALA, into two different plasma samplingwindows: 1 to 3 h and 5 to 8 h or 3 to 5 h and 8 to 12 h until at least 50 subjects provide viable PD Phase Anti-Xa values.  All plasma samples should be drawn within the assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, record the actual time the plasma sample is drawn in the Case Report Form (CRF) and repeat it when appropriate at the correct time, if possible.The plasma sampling times can be spread over the duration of the PD Phase (up to7 days) to avoid blood volume shifts if necessary. The assignment of the time points tothe subjects within each age group will be centrally randomized.Follow-up Phase:After subjects successfully complete the PD Phase, they will enter the Follow-up Phase.During this phase, dalteparin sodium will be administered subcutaneously every 12 hours \u00b11 hour (no less than 8 hours between doses) with the maintenance therapeutic dose at Visits 5, 6 and 7. However, if a dose is not able to be delivered every 12 hours \u00b11 hour, administer the dose (no less than 8 hours between doses) and record the actual dosing. One Anti-Xa plasma sample will be collected at 4 hours \u00b11 hour post-dose at each visit to check if the Anti-Xa level remains within the target therapeutic range. If not, a dose adjustment may be required, per Investigator judgment.  All plasma samples should be drawn within the assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, record the actual time the sample is drawn. Plasma samples drawn during the follow up phase that deviate outside the 4 \u00b1 1 hr window cannot use the Anti-Xa reference range, 0.5-1.0, and should be repeated the next day for both central and local labs. The actual dosing time prior to the repeat plasma sample draw and the actual time of the repeat sample draw must be recorded.For non-cancer patients who stop dalteparin treatment prior to 3 months according to the ACCP Guidelines, Anti-Xa and Anti-IIa plasma sampling will not be required after study medication discontinuation.Throughout the 3 month study period, the actual times of dosing and anti-Xa blood draw times will be captured on the patient Case Report Form (CRF).The use of intravenous or intra-arterial cannulas for blood sample collection is not permitted.",

However, if a dose is not able to be delivered every 12 hours \u00b11 hour, administer the dose (no less than 8 hours between doses) and record the actual dosing time. The first Anti-Xa plasma sample drawn after the initial dose of study drug treatment should be conducted 4 hours \u00b11 hour after the first, second or third dose of study medication per Investigator judgment.  Subsequent Anti-Xa plasma samplesconducted following dose adjustments will also be drawn at 4 hours \u00b11 hourpost-dose, after the first, second or third dose of study medication per Investigator judgment. .  If the Anti-Xa level is not within the target therapeutic range of 0.5-1.0 IU/mL, the dose must be adjusted in increments or decrements of 25 IU/kgin order to achieve target Anti-Xa levels (0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL). After doseadjustment, Anti-Xa levels should be measured also after the first, second or third dose per Investigator judgment. If the therapeutic range is not achieved after amaximum of 6 adjustments (up to Day 7), the subject will be withdrawn from thestudy.2. Pharmacodynamic Phase:Subjects completing the Dose Adjustment Phase will enter into the PD Phase andwill continue with daily dosing every 12 hours \u00b11 hour with dalteparin sodium withthe final dose from the Dose Adjustment Phase (no less than 8 hours between doses).However, if a dose is not able to be delivered every 12 hours \u00b11 hour, administer the dose (no less than 8 hours between doses) and record the actual dosing time. Subjectswill be randomized to two different plasma sampling windows (1 to 3 h and 5 to8 h or 3 to 5 h and 8 to 12 h) for anti-Xa plasma samples (for the central lab, only) via the Pfizer Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) system, IMPALA (see below).

The plasma sampling times can takeplace over the duration of the PD Phase to avoid blood volume shifts if necessary.  If a plasma sample is not drawn during the correct assigned time point, it should be repeated if possible, at the correct time point when appropriate.The assignment of the plasma sampling time points to the subjects within each age group will be centrally randomized via the IMPALA system (note that only plasma sampling groups will be randomized, not study medication.  This is an open-label treatment study).The two plasma samples will be collected from each subject during the PD Phase based on the subject\u2019s assigned plasma sampling randomization group:\uf0b7Randomization Schedule A:FRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)\nFinal Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016\nPage 42\n\uf0b7\nOne sample at 1 to 3 hours post-dose;\n\uf0b7\nOne sample at 5 to 8 hours post-dose.\n\uf0b7\nRandomization Schedule B:\n\uf0b7\nOne sample at 3 to 5 hours post-dose;\n\uf0b7\nOne sample at 8 to 12 hours post-dose.\n3. Follow-up Phase:\nIn the Follow-Up Phase, subjects will continue daily dosing every 12 hours \u00b11 hour \nwith dalteparin sodium with the final dose from the Dose Adjustment Phase (no less \nthan 8 hours between doses) until EOS or ET. However, if a dose is not able to be \ndelivered every 12 hours \u00b11 hour, administer the dose (no less than 8 hours between \ndoses) and record the actual dosing time. In-clinic visits will occur on Visits 5, 6 and \n7 for safety, and efficacy assessments, and Anti-Xa plasma samples.  Dose \nadjustments can be made during these visits if necessary.  The Principal Investigator or \ndesignee will follow-up weekly during a telephone interview with subjects and/or \ncaregivers after discharge from the hospital to assess study compliance and general \nwell-being.  Subjects will have repeat imaging (using the same imaging method used \nat Screening) at the EOS visit or Early Termination (ET) visit to measure clot \nresolution.\nFor non-cancer patients who stop dalteparin treatment prior to 3 months according to the \nACCP Guidelines, Anti-Xa and Anti-IIa plasma sampling will not be required after study \nmedication discontinuation.\nTreatment will continue until any of the following occurs:\n\uf0b7\nNew or progressive VTE (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic);\n\uf0b7\nBleeding necessitating permanent discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy;\n\uf0b7\nUnexpected thrombocytopenia;\n\uf0b7\nOther AEs necessitating discontinuation of study drug, withdrawal of consent, or \nscheduled study termination completion;\n\uf0b7\nUnexpected permanent discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy.\nFor procedures that require interruption of study treatment, it is recommended to follow\nthe ACCP guidelines.1 The guidelines state that it may be advisable to omit two doses of\nLMWH before procedures being performed and resume 12 to 24 hours after the procedures.\nFRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)Final Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016Page 43",

A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the \ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed \nduring his partner\u2019s pregnancy.\nIf a study subject or study subject\u2019s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the \nstudy subject\u2019s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this \ninformation to the Pfizer drug safety unit on an SAE report form and an EDP supplemental \nform, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit \ninformation regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a \nsubject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation \nor spillage) using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an \nAE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information \nsubmitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related \nto termination of pregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for \nall EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until \ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow-up \nto the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the \nneonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for \ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the \nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test \nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, \nspontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a \nlive-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the \ninvestigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: \n\uf0b7\nSpontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\n\uf0b7\nNeonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without \nregard to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be \nreported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or \npossibly related to exposure to the investigational product. \nAdditional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the investigator.  Further \nfollow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on \npreterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal exposure, the \ninvestigator will provide the study subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information \nForm to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that \nthe subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his \npartner.\nFRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)Final Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016Page 64",

In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of subjects\u2019 personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws.The informed consent/assent documents must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws.The informed consent/assent documents used during the informed consent process must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection.The investigator must ensure that each study subject or his or her legally acceptable representative, or parent(s) or legal guardian if a minor, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. Whenever consent is obtained from a subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative/parent(s) or legal guardian, the subject\u2019s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC.  If the investigator determines that a subject\u2019s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonably be consulted, then, as permitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, the subject\u2019s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained.  If the study subject does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record why the subject did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative, the consent FRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)Final Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016Page 71signer\u2019s relationship to the study subject (eg, parent, spouse), and that the subject\u2019s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally it must be documented in the source documents.If the study includes minor subjects who reach the age of majority during the study, as recognized under local law, they must re-consent as adults to remain in the study.  If the enrollment of \u2018emancipated minors\u2019 is permitted by the study age criteria, the IRB/EC, and local law, they must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the permission of a parent or legal guardian. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative, parent(s) or legal guardian and the subject\u2019s assent, when applicable, before any study-specific activity is performed, unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by an IRB/EC.  The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent/assent document.",

It must be stressed that the standards as drafted are only a guide to physicians all\nover the world. Physicians are not relieved from criminal, civil and ethical responsibilities\nunder the laws of their own countries.\nI. BASIC PRINCIPLES\n1. Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted \nscientific principles and should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal \nexperimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature.\n2. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects \nshould be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be transmitted for \nconsideration, comment and guidance to a specially appointed committee independent of \nthe investigator and the sponsor provided that this independent committee is in \nconformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research experiment \nis performed.\n3. Biomedical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically \nqualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person.  \nThe responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified \nperson and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given his \nor her consent.\n4. Biomedical research involving human subjects cannot legitimately be carried out unless \nthe importance of the objective is in proportion to the inherent risk to the subject.\n5. Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by \ncareful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the \nsubject or to others. Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the \ninterests of science and society.\n6. The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity must always be \nrespected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject and to \nminimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the \npersonality of the subject.\n7. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects \nunless they are satisfied that the hazards involved are believed to be predictable.  \nPhysicians should cease any investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the \npotential benefits.\n8. In publication of the results of his or her research, the physician is obliged to preserve the \naccuracy of the results. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles \nlaid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.\n9. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of \nthe aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the \ndiscomfort it may entail. He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to \nabstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw his or her \nconsent to participation at any time.  The physician should then obtain the subject's \nfreely given informed consent, preferably in writing.\nFRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)\nFinal Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016\nPage 82\n10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be \nparticularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship to him or her or may \nconsent under duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a \nphysician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of \nthis official relationship.\n11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal \nguardian in accordance with national legislation. Where physical or mental incapacity \nmakes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, \npermission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with \nnational legislation.\nWhenever the minor child is in fact able to give consent, the\nminor's consent must be obtained in addition to the consent of the minor's legal guardian.\n12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations \ninvolved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration are \ncomplied with.\nII. MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH PROFESSIONAL CARE (Clinical\nResearch)\n1. In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and \ntherapeutic measure, if in his or her judgment it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing \nhealth, or alleviating suffering.\n2. The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed \nagainst the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods.\n3. In any medical study, every subject including those of a control group, if any - should \nbe assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. This does not exclude \nthe use of inert placebo in studies where no proven diagnostic or therapeutic method \nexists.\n4. The refusal of the subject to participate in a study must never interfere with the \nphysician-subject relationship.\n5. If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons \nfor this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the \nindependent committee (I, 2).\n6. The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being \nthe acquisition of new medical knowledge, only to the extent that medical research is \njustified by its potential diagnostic or therapeutic value for the subject.\nIII. NON-THERAPEUTIC BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN \nSUBJECTS (Non-Clinical Biomedical Research)\n1. In the purely scientific application of medical research carried out on a human being, it is \nthe duty of the physician to remain the protector of the life and health of that person on \nwhom biomedical research is being carried out.\n2. The subject should be volunteers - either healthy persons or subjects for whom the \nexperimental design is not related to the subject's illness.\nFRAG-A001-201 (A6301094)\nFinal Protocol Amendment 9, 18 October 2016\nPage 83\n3. The investigator or the investigating team should discontinue the research if in his/her or \ntheir judgment it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual.\n4. In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over\nconsiderations related to the wellbeing of the subject.\n",
