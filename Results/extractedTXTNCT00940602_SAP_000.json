Censoring for \npatients without such an increase in LVISD will be at the time of a last LVISD assessment \n(Section 2.7.3.3). \n2.7.1.7\nTime to first occurrence of serum ferritin > 2 times the baseline value\nAn evaluation of the time from randomization to the first occurrence of serum ferritin > 2 times \nthe baseline value at two consecutive assessments (at least two weeks apart) will be performed per \ntreatment group based on the following variable: \n\uf0b7\ndate of the first of the two consecutive laboratory assessment fulfilling the criterion of SF > 2 \n\u00d7 baseline value minus date of randomization plus 1 \nThe time-to-event analysis follows the description given in Section 2.5.2.2. Censoring for \npatients without such a serum ferritin increase is described in Section 2.5.3.6.\n2.7.1.8\nInfections\nInfections requiring intravenous antimicrobials during the treatment period (until the 28 day \nfollow-up visit) will be evaluated separately for each treatment group.\nDefinitions:\n\uf0b7\nInfections will be determined from the reported adverse events with system organ class \n\"Infections and infestations\" and action taken \u201cConcomitant medication taken\u201d.\n\uf0b7\nAntimicrobial therapy will be determined from the reported concomitant medications for \npatients who had an infection AE. The medications will be based on a pre-specified list of \nWHO low level ATC codes. The route of administration needs to be specified as \n\u201cintravenous (i.v.)\u201d.\n\uf0b7\nIdentified events will be combined with medications (of the same patient) based on the \nfollowing criterion: start date of medication \u2265start date of AE and start date of medication \n\u2264minimum (start date of AE + 1, end date of AE).\nThe total number of infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials will be counted and \nsummarized per treatment group. For this number, one patient can contribute more than one \ninfection event. To account for different lengths of observation time in the two groups, the \nrate of infections will be calculated with the number of recorded infections treated with \nintravenous antimicrobials divided by the total number of patient-years of follow-up. The \nrelative risk of infection will be calculated as the rate of infection in the treatment group \ncompared with the rate in the placebo group.\n",
