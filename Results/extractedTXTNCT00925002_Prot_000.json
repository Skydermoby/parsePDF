INTRODUCTION\n1.1. Indication\nTafamidis is being developed for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, specifically \ntargeting ATTR polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy.  This protocol will be specific for the \nATTR polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) indication.\nMarketing authorization for TTR-FAP was granted in the European Union on 16 November \n2011 for the indication of treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 \nsymptomatic polyneuropathy to delay neurologic impairment.\n1.2. Background and Rationale\nTransthyretin amyloidosis is a disease induced by accumulation of insoluble fibrillar protein \nas amyloid, in the tissues in amounts sufficient to impair normal function.  The major \nphenotypic presentations are a sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy (ATTR with \npolyneuropathy, or TTR-FAP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (ATTR with cardiomyopathy, \nor TTR-CM).  Transthyretin, a 127-amino acid, 55 kDa protein, primarily synthesized in the \nliver, is a secreted protein present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and is a carrier of \nthyroxine and retinol-binding protein-retinol (vitamin A) complex.1, 2  In its native state, TTR \nexists as a homotetramer with two C2 symmetric funnel-shaped thyroxine binding sites \nlocated at the central dimer-dimer interface.\nNatural amino acid sequence (wild-type) TTR and mutated variants of TTR can be involved \nin amyloid disease.  However, mutated TTR species are more prone to accelerated \nfibrillogenesis, the most important risk factor for TTR amyloidosis.1, 2  There are more than \n80 TTR point mutations that have been associated with TTR amyloidosis.3  All \ndisease-associated mutations characterized thus far destabilize the TTR tetramer and many \ninfluence the velocity of rate-limiting tetramer dissociation.4  An amyloidogenic mutation or \naging can lead to tetramer dissociation into an alternatively folded monomeric amyloidogenic \nintermediate.  This intermediate self-assembles into profilaments, filaments, and, under \ncertain conditions, amyloid fibrils.4, 5 In fact, the rate determining step for TTR amyloid \nformation is tetramer dissociation.6\nV30M is the most common mutation associated with TTR-FAP, with major foci of patients \nin Portugal, Sweden and Japan. The disease usually begins in the third or fourth decade, but \nthe onset of symptoms may be later, particularly in Sweden.  Initial symptoms include \ndecrease in temperature and pain sensation in the lower extremities; autonomic dysfunction, \nincluding orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal motility disorders, impotence, and urinary \nretention/incontinence.  As the disease progresses to involve larger myelinated fibers, muscle \nweakness, loss of reflexes, and the impairment of position and vibratory sensations can \noccur.  At this stage, involvement of upper extremities becomes apparent.  Although \npenetrance varies greatly among geographic and ethnic foci, the outcome of TTR-FAP is \ninvariably progressive and fatal.7, 8  The length of survival for patients with TTR-FAP is \nseverely shortened.  After a mean interval of 10 years from initial symptom, patients usually \nTafamidis meglumine\nFx1A-303/B3461023\nFinal Protocol Amendment 2, 05 June 2012\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 19\ndie from progressive and relentless worsening of the neuropathy, secondary infections, \ncachexia or sudden death.7  The only currently available disease-modifying treatment option \nis liver transplant.\n1.2.1. Tafamidis for the Treatment of TTR-FAP\nPfizer, Inc. is currently investigating tafamidis meglumine (Fx-1006A) for the treatment of \nTTR-FAP.  Tafamidis meglumine, d-glucitol, 1-deoxy-1-(methylamino)-, \n2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-6-benzoxazolecarboxylate (1:1), is the meglumine salt form of \ntafamidis (Fx-1006), 2-(3,5-dichloro-phenyl)-benzoxazole-6-carboxylic acid, a novel, small \nmolecule stabilizer of transthyretin.  Specifically, tafamidis exhibits non-cooperative binding \n(ie, dissociation constants of 2 nM [Kd1] and 154 nM [Kd2], respectively) to the two thyroxine \nbinding sites on the native tetrameric form of TTR and thereby prevents its dissociation into \nmonomers.  At low pH, fibril formation of wild-type TTR and the most prevalent \namyloidogenic variants, V30M and V122I, is potently inhibited by tafamidis.  No fibril \nformation is observed for wild-type, V30M, and V122I variants at a 2:1 tafamidis: TTR \nstoichiometry.  Under urea denaturating conditions, only 33% of TTR tetramer dissociates \nafter incubation for 72 hours with equimolar quantity of tafamidis, when negligible tetramer \ndissociation is observed at a 2:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry.  Based on these data, it \nappears that a 1:1 tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry should be sufficient to stabilize TTR.  The \nnormal range of TTR level is between 18 and 38 mg/dL, corresponding to 3.2 to 6.8 \u03bcM of \nTTR.  Therefore, plasma level of 3.6 to 7.2 \u03bcM (~1-2 \u03bcg/mL) of tafamidis should stabilize \nTTR levels at least to the upper limit of the normal range.\nIn vitro addition of tafamidis and tafamidis meglumine to human plasma stabilizes wild-type, \nV30M, and V122I tetrameric TTR under strong urea denaturing conditions for at least \n4 days.  Under these same conditions most of the TTR is denatured in 2 days in the absence \nof stabilizer.  Stabilization is observed at tafamidis concentrations between 3.6 and 7.2 \u03bcM \nfor TTR plasma levels ranging from low [15.5 mg/dL (2.8 \u03bbM)] to high [28 mg/dL (5 \u03bcM)], \nconfirming the effective therapeutic plasma level range between 3.6 and 7.2 \u03bcM \n(corresponding to ~1-2 \u03bcg/mL concentration of tafamidis in plasma).  Ex-vivo results with \nplasma samples from initial Phase 1 clinical testing confirm this hypothesis and indicate that \ndrug plasma levels between 0.7 to 1.7 \u03bcg/mL stabilize plasma TTR (when TTR plasma levels \nare between 16 and 36 mg/dL) after once a day dosing with tafamidis meglumine.  Based on \nPhase 1 results, this drug level range would be achieved at steady-state after once-daily \n20 mg (soft gel capsule), the tafamidis meglumine dose chosen for clinical evaluation.\nRefer to the tafamidis (Fx-1006A) Investigator Brochure for further information.\n1.2.2. Study Rationale\nThis current study is being conducted to obtain additional safety and efficacy data and to \nprovide continued dosing of tafamidis for up to 10 years, or until subject has access to \ntafamidis for TTR-FAP via prescription, to patients with TTR-FAP who have not undergone \nliver or heart transplantation and who have completed either Protocol Fx-006 (EudraCT \nTafamidis meglumine\nFx1A-303/B3461023\nFinal Protocol Amendment 2, 05 June 2012\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 20\n2008-001262-87) or Protocol Fx1A-201 (EudraCT 2007-006791-12), as described above.  \nUpon regulatory approval for the treatment of TTR-FAP in their respective country and \naccess to prescription tafamidis, subjects may be withdrawn from the study.  The decision to \nwithdraw subjects in a country will be done in consultation between the investigator and the \nsponsor (see Section 6.3).  Subjects will continue to receive once-daily 20 mg tafamidis.  \nSafety will be assessed via the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, the use of concomitant \nmedications, and by results from clinical laboratory testing, physical examinations, ECGs, \nand vital signs.\nPrior to enrollment in this current study, subjects who complete Protocol Fx-006 will have \nreceived study medication for a total of 30 months (18 months of double-blinded treatment in \nProtocol Fx-005 plus 12 months of open-label treatment in Protocol Fx-006); subjects who \ncomplete Protocol Fx1A-201 will have received open-label tafamidis for 12 months.\n1.2.3. Non-Clinical Experience of Tafamidis\nNonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and \nexcretion; ADME), and toxicology studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo in the mouse, \nrat, rabbit, and dog have been completed.  In vitro nonclinical studies have confirmed that the \npharmacological activity of tafamidis is consistent with its high affinity binding to the two \nthyroxine binding sites of TTR in a non-cooperative manner and the resulting stabilization of \nTTR (wild type and amyloidogenic variants) by preventing dissociation of tetramers into \nmonomers.\nThe general safety pharmacology profile of tafamidis demonstrated minimal nonselective \nbinding to enzymes or ion channels, with no potential for anti-inflammatory activity.\nTafamidis had minimal effects on either the central nervous system or cardiopulmonary \nphysiology parameters in dogs. Tafamidis did not demonstrate the potential for QT \nprolongation. QTc shortening, observed at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg, was associated with \ntotal plasma concentrations that exceeded 90 \u03bcg/mL. However, mean human steady-state \nmaximum concentration (Cmax) values following the daily therapeutic dose of 20 mg in \nelderly and nonelderly subjects were 2.8 and 2.3 \u03bcg/mL respectively. Given the 30 to \n40-fold difference in exposures, it is felt that the nonclinical observations have little \nrelevance to the clinical profile of tafamidis.\nPredictable pharmacokinetic behavior of tafamidis was demonstrated following oral \nadministration in the nonclinical species. Tafamidis was absorbed following oral \nadministration with an absolute bioavailability >90% and exhibited dose proportional \nincreases in Cmax and AUC at dose up to 30 mg/kg, but further increases in the administered \ndose provided less than proportional increases in systemic exposure, indicating saturation in \nthe drug absorption. Terminal plasma half life is about 40 hours following a single \nadministration. Drug accumulation has been confirmed in repeated dose studies.\nTafamidis meglumine\nFx1A-303/B3461023\nFinal Protocol Amendment 2, 05 June 2012\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 21\nTafamidis is readily absorbed through the intestinal wall upon administration and is bound to \na high extent to plasma proteins (>97%), essentially TTR and albumin. Tafamidis distributes \nwidely in tissues (maternal and fetal), crosses the placental barrier to an extent of less than \n5% of the initial dose, and ~ 30% of the dam\u2019s dose transferred into the milk.\nTafamidis demonstrated a high degree of metabolic stability and its limited biotransformation \nresulted in the formation of a monoglucuronide (acylglucuronide) as the primary metabolite \nin most of the nonclinical species and humans, while a monooxidative product was only \ndetected in the mouse and rabbit.  In rats, tafamidis is cleared primarily via biliary excretion \nand fecal elimination with some enterohepatic circulation, with a smaller contribution by the \nurine.   A human ADME study suggests similar pathways are operative in humans.\nTafamidis meglumine has been evaluated in vitro to assess protein binding, induction and \ninhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5), and \ninhibition of transporter protein P glycoprotein (P gp), with results suggesting very low \nlikelihood for clinical drug-drug interactions.  No significant CYP 450 inhibition was \nobserved.  A series of nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs to \nassess the safety of tafamidis. The absence of acute toxicity following a single dose of \ntafamidis up to 600 mg/kg in dogs is indicative of a low risk for overdose. Tafamidis was \nwell tolerated following repeated daily oral administration up to 26 weeks in rats and \n39 weeks in dogs. The NOAEL was determined to be 30 mg/kg/day in the rat and \n45 mg/kg/day in dog. When doses were increased above the NOAELs, rodents had a drug \naccumulation in their stomachs while dogs vomited. Other signs of toxicity accompanied \nthese obvious signs, including decreased food intake, modified feces, stress related signs, \nincrease in liver weight and in liver enzyme levels, lymphoid depletion, and kidney lesions in \nrodents. \nTafamidis was nongenotoxic in a battery of in vitro studies, although a slight increase in \nfrequency of polyploid cells was observed at 100 and 200 \u03bcg/mL in the presence of \nS9 activation but not without metabolic activation in the in vitro chromosome aberration \nassay using human peripheral lymphocytes. Polyploidy is not considered to be a reliable \nsurrogate marker for aneugenicity.  The lack of risk for aneuploidy induction with tafamidis \nwas further evidenced by the lack of micronucleus induction in the bone marrow of \nSprague-Dawley rats at the doses producing Cmax and AUC values significantly exceeding \nthe predicted clinical exposures (~ 72X over the Cmax and ~ 67X over the steady state \nAUC(0-24) observed in humans, based on exposure in a 4-week rat study). The evaluation of \nthe carcinogenic potential in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice did not demonstrate an increase in \nthe incidence of neoplasia.\nTafamidis did not demonstrate any effects on fertility, general reproductive performance and \nearly embryo-fetal development in the rat and the maternal and paternal NOEL for \nreproductive toxicity was determined to be greater than 30 mg/kg/day. Developmental \ntoxicity was evident in the rat by reduced fetal weights in the 30 and 45 mg/kg/day maternal \ndosage groups (developmental NOAEL = 15 mg/kg). Developmental toxicity in the rabbit \nwas demonstrated by increased post-implantation loss, reduced fetal body weight and \nassociated skeletal variations, and malformation at 8 mg/kg and skelatal variations at \nTafamidis meglumine\nFx1A-303/B3461023\nFinal Protocol Amendment 2, 05 June 2012\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 22\n2 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for developmental toxicity in rabbits was 0.5 mg/kg/day.\nTafamidis-related toxicity in the developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproduction toxicity \nstudy in rats resulted in a NOAEL for reproductive toxicity and for viability and growth of \nthe F1 generation of 5 mg/kg/day. Women of child-bearing potential should take measures \nto prevent pregnancy while being treated with tafamidis.\nNon-clinical data indicate that there is a large safety margin above the anticipated human \nefficacious plasma concentration and those concentrations associated with toxicity in rats or \ndogs. Emesis was the most common form of clinical intolerance in the dog. Owing to the \ndosing strategy, the immediate emetic activity led to apparent aspiration of gastric contents \nand/or drug, leading to moribundity and subsequent euthanasia. The gastric impaction and \nsubsequent delayed gastric emptying, presumably followed by circulatory distress, shock and \nmultiorgan failure, in rats was caused by a supraclinical dosing regimen and is not a relevant \nrisk to human subjects. While the exact mechanism(s) for the toxicities observed following \nthe oral administration of tafamidis has not been elucidated, there is an ample therapeutic \nmargin to permit safe exposure to humans and there was no toxicity identified that would \npreclude human use, such as undetectable lesions or irreversible damage.\nNo target organs of tafamidis-related toxicity were identified in the repeated dose toxicity \nstudies conducted in rats or dogs (26 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively).

Nephrosis was the primary lesion \nnoted in the kidneys, only in male mice and in a dose-dependent manner. In the liver, \ncentrilobular hypertrophy and scattered single cell necrosis were present in male mice more \nthan in the female mice in terms of the incidence of both lesions and the severity of the \ncentrilobular hypertrophy. The incidence of both liver lesions was dose dependent.\nHowever, the mouse (CByB6F1) did not demonstrate a unique monooxide metabolite that \nwas not present in the rat or dog, nor has it been detected in the plasma of humans \nadministered tafamidis.   However, a causal relationship between the monoxide metabolite \nand the liver and/or kidney lesions has not been established.\nGenerally, there were no significant toxicities observed in the repeated dose toxicology \nstudies in the rat and dog. Therefore, tafamidis was considered to be well tolerated in the rat \nat dose levels up to 30 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks, providing an exposure ratio of 45- to 63-fold \nbased on the human AUC at steady state, and in the dog at dose levels up to 45 mg/kg/day for \n39 weeks providing an exposure ratio of 29- to 36-fold based on the human AUC at steady \nstate. Additionally, there was no evidence for an increased risk of neoplasia at exposures at \nleast 31-fold the human AUC nor was there evidence of any tafamidis-related genotoxicity.\nWith the exception of the reproductive developmental toxicity findings, tafamidis has an \nexcellent nonclinical safety profile.\nRefer to the tafamidis Investigator Brochure for further details.\nTafamidis meglumine\nFx1A-303/B3461023\nFinal Protocol Amendment 2, 05 June 2012\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 23\n1.2.4. Tafamidis (Fx-1006A) Clinical Experience\nThe clinical development program for tafamidis has included 13 controlled and uncontrolled \nclinical trials and two non-interventional, observational studies.  As of 13 May 2011, patients \nwith TTR-FAP (n=127) received 20 mg of tafamidis administered daily for an average of \n538 days (range of 15 to 994 days) or approximately 187 patient-years. The mean duration \nof exposure was 17.7 months: 87 were treated for at least 1 year, 43 were treated for at least \n2 years, and 31 were treated for at least 30-<36 months.    \nThe tafamidis 20 mg soft gelatin capsule (as used in the clinical studies) demonstrated a half-life \naverage of 59 hours and Cavg(SS) average of 2.07 \u03bcg/mL (SD=0.20). The tafamidis 20-mg soft \ngelatin capsule daily dose resulted in an average fluctuation (peak to trough) of 51.8%, with an \naverage minimum concentration (Cmin) of 1.61 \u03bcg/mL and an average Cmax of 2.66 \u03bcg/mL. The \naverage range was consistent with the 1 to 2 \u03bcg/mL required to stabilize the TTR tetramer; steady \nstate was attained within 12 days, and exposure was consistent across subjects, with low \nvariability across subjects for key PK parameters.  Note that steady-state exposure was similar \nbetween males and females.  Therefore, the 20 mg daily dose has been used in the development \nprogram.  \nThe primary purpose of a therapy such as tafamidis is to stabilize the TTR tetramer, thus \ninhibiting the amyloid cascade and ultimately halting or slowing TTR-FAP disease progression \nover a sustained period of time.  During the 18-month period of intervention in Study Fx-005, \ntafamidis slowed the course of neurological impairment and maintained quality of life in treated \npatients. Together, with the extension Study Fx-006 data, tafamidis demonstrated a sustained \neffect over 30 months, a period of time representing approximately 25% of the average \nTTR-FAP disease duration of 10 years. Further, Study Fx1A-201 was a small Phase II open \nlabel, single-treatment arm study designed primarily to determine the efficacy of tafamidis in \nstabilizing TTR variants other than the V30M (valine replaced by methionine at position 30) \nmutation. The results from this study of non-V30M TTR-FAP patients, which represented an \nolder, more severely affected patient population, strongly supported the observed efficacy of \ntafamidis in V30M patients.  As in Study Fx-005, the consistency of response across endpoints \nmeasuring different aspects of this multi-faceted disease was again observed following \n12 months treatment with tafamidis.  The results indicated the disease-modifying utility of \ntafamidis in treating all patients with TTR-FAP, regardless of mutation. \nTTR-FAP is a rare disorder.  The safety data described reflect exposure of 127 TTR-FAP patients \nto 20 mg of tafamidis administered daily for an average of 538 days (ranging from 15 to 994 \ndays).  The population was composed of adult patients diagnosed with symptomatic TTR-FAP, \nwith a mean age of approximately 44 years; approximately half of the patients were female, and \napproximately 90% of the patients were Caucasian. Note that primary evidence of safety and \nefficacy was obtained from a placebo-controlled 18-month study in patients with TTR-FAP.  \nTable 1 provides a summary of the most common TEAEs (\u22655% in tafamidis treatment group) \nand reported at a higher incidence in tafamidis than in placebo during the pivotal Phase 2/3 \nstudy (Study Fx-005).\n",

                "Content": "Transthyretin amyloidosis is a disease induced by accumulation of insoluble fibrillar protein as amyloid, in the tissues in amounts sufficient to impair normal function.  The major phenotypic presentations are a sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy (ATTR with polyneuropathy, or TTR-FAP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (ATTR with cardiomyopathy, or TTR-CM).  Transthyretin, a 127-amino acid, 55 kDa protein, primarily synthesized in the liver, is a secreted protein present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and is a carrier of thyroxine and retinol-binding protein-retinol (vitamin A) complex.1, 2  In its native state, TTR exists as a homotetramer with two C2 symmetric funnel-shaped thyroxine binding sites located at the central dimer-dimer interface.Natural amino acid sequence (wild-type) TTR and mutated variants of TTR can be involved in amyloid disease.  However, mutated TTR species are more prone to accelerated fibrillogenesis, the most important risk factor for TTR amyloidosis.1, 2  There are more than 80 TTR point mutations that have been associated with TTR amyloidosis.3  All disease-associated mutations characterized thus far destabilize the TTR tetramer and many influence the velocity of rate-limiting tetramer dissociation.4  An amyloidogenic mutation or aging can lead to tetramer dissociation into an alternatively folded monomeric amyloidogenic intermediate.  This intermediate self-assembles into profilaments, filaments, and, under certain conditions, amyloid fibrils.4, 5 In fact, the rate determining step for TTR amyloid formation is tetramer dissociation.6V30M is the most common mutation associated with TTR-FAP, with major foci of patients in Portugal, Sweden and Japan. The disease usually begins in the third or fourth decade, but the onset of symptoms may be later, particularly in Sweden.  Initial symptoms include decrease in temperature and pain sensation in the lower extremities; autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal motility disorders, impotence, and urinary retention/incontinence.  As the disease progresses to involve larger myelinated fibers, muscle weakness, loss of reflexes, and the impairment of position and vibratory sensations can occur.  At this stage, involvement of upper extremities becomes apparent.  Although penetrance varies greatly among geographic and ethnic foci, the outcome of TTR-FAP is invariably progressive and fatal.7, 8  The length of survival for patients with TTR-FAP is severely shortened.  After a mean interval of 10 years from initial symptom, patients usually ",

Tafamidis distributes \nwidely in tissues (maternal and fetal), crosses the placental barrier to an extent of less than \n5% of the initial dose, and ~ 30% of the dam\u2019s dose transferred into the milk.\nTafamidis demonstrated a high degree of metabolic stability and its limited biotransformation \nresulted in the formation of a monoglucuronide (acylglucuronide) as the primary metabolite \nin most of the nonclinical species and humans, while a monooxidative product was only \ndetected in the mouse and rabbit.  In rats, tafamidis is cleared primarily via biliary excretion \nand fecal elimination with some enterohepatic circulation, with a smaller contribution by the \nurine.   A human ADME study suggests similar pathways are operative in humans.\nTafamidis meglumine has been evaluated in vitro to assess protein binding, induction and \ninhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5), and \ninhibition of transporter protein P glycoprotein (P gp), with results suggesting very low \nlikelihood for clinical drug-drug interactions.  No significant CYP 450 inhibition was \nobserved.  A series of nonclinical toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs to \nassess the safety of tafamidis. The absence of acute toxicity following a single dose of \ntafamidis up to 600 mg/kg in dogs is indicative of a low risk for overdose. Tafamidis was \nwell tolerated following repeated daily oral administration up to 26 weeks in rats and \n39 weeks in dogs. The NOAEL was determined to be 30 mg/kg/day in the rat and \n45 mg/kg/day in dog. When doses were increased above the NOAELs, rodents had a drug \naccumulation in their stomachs while dogs vomited. Other signs of toxicity accompanied \nthese obvious signs, including decreased food intake, modified feces, stress related signs, \nincrease in liver weight and in liver enzyme levels, lymphoid depletion, and kidney lesions in \nrodents. \nTafamidis was nongenotoxic in a battery of in vitro studies, although a slight increase in \nfrequency of polyploid cells was observed at 100 and 200 \u03bcg/mL in the presence of \nS9 activation but not without metabolic activation in the in vitro chromosome aberration \nassay using human peripheral lymphocytes. Polyploidy is not considered to be a reliable \nsurrogate marker for aneugenicity.  The lack of risk for aneuploidy induction with tafamidis \nwas further evidenced by the lack of micronucleus induction in the bone marrow of \nSprague-Dawley rats at the doses producing Cmax and AUC values significantly exceeding \nthe predicted clinical exposures (~ 72X over the Cmax and ~ 67X over the steady state \nAUC(0-24) observed in humans, based on exposure in a 4-week rat study). The evaluation of \nthe carcinogenic potential in hemizygous Tg.rasH2 mice did not demonstrate an increase in \nthe incidence of neoplasia.\nTafamidis did not demonstrate any effects on fertility, general reproductive performance and \nearly embryo-fetal development in the rat and the maternal and paternal NOEL for \nreproductive toxicity was determined to be greater than 30 mg/kg/day. Developmental \ntoxicity was evident in the rat by reduced fetal weights in the 30 and 45 mg/kg/day maternal \ndosage groups (developmental NOAEL = 15 mg/kg). Developmental toxicity in the rabbit \nwas demonstrated by increased post-implantation loss, reduced fetal body weight and \nassociated skeletal variations, and malformation at 8 mg/kg and skelatal variations at \nTafamidis meglumine\nFx1A-303/B3461023\nFinal Protocol Amendment 2, 05 June 2012\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 22\n2 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for developmental toxicity in rabbits was 0.5 mg/kg/day.\nTafamidis-related toxicity in the developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproduction toxicity \nstudy in rats resulted in a NOAEL for reproductive toxicity and for viability and growth of \nthe F1 generation of 5 mg/kg/day. Women of child-bearing potential should take measures \nto prevent pregnancy while being treated with tafamidis.\nNon-clinical data indicate that there is a large safety margin above the anticipated human \nefficacious plasma concentration and those concentrations associated with toxicity in rats or \ndogs. Emesis was the most common form of clinical intolerance in the dog. Owing to the \ndosing strategy, the immediate emetic activity led to apparent aspiration of gastric contents \nand/or drug, leading to moribundity and subsequent euthanasia. The gastric impaction and \nsubsequent delayed gastric emptying, presumably followed by circulatory distress, shock and \nmultiorgan failure, in rats was caused by a supraclinical dosing regimen and is not a relevant \nrisk to human subjects. While the exact mechanism(s) for the toxicities observed following \nthe oral administration of tafamidis has not been elucidated, there is an ample therapeutic \nmargin to permit safe exposure to humans and there was no toxicity identified that would \npreclude human use, such as undetectable lesions or irreversible damage.\nNo target organs of tafamidis-related toxicity were identified in the repeated dose toxicity \nstudies conducted in rats or dogs (26 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively). However, in the \nCByB6F1 hybrid mouse and the tg.rasH2 mouse, the liver and/or kidney have been identified \nas target organs as non-neoplastic lesions were noted following treatment for 28 days \n(CByB6F1 hybrid mouse) or 26 weeks (tg.rasH2 mouse).

Additionally, there was no evidence for an increased risk of neoplasia at exposures at \nleast 31-fold the human AUC nor was there evidence of any tafamidis-related genotoxicity.\nWith the exception of the reproductive developmental toxicity findings, tafamidis has an \nexcellent nonclinical safety profile.\nRefer to the tafamidis Investigator Brochure for further details.\n",

As patients with moderate hepatic impairment have lower TTR levels than healthy subjects, dosage adjustment is not necessary as the stoichiometry of tafamidis with its target protein TTR would be sufficient for stabilization of the TTR tetramer in these patients.
