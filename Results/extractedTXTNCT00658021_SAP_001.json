Updated to allow for possibility of analysis of treatment period data and safety follow-up period data separatelyImportant Protocol Deviation #1 has been amended to consider screening time, rather than enrolment.Baseline definition and end of study treatment measurement have been updated.Columns for the EBID treatment groups have been swapped.Updated to only consider informed consent, and not assent.Race and Region has been updated.Ethnic group has been deleted.Country has been sorted in alphabetical order.Medications will be presented for ITT and safety follow-up analysis set.MI definition has been extended and additional table for primary analysis has been added.Post-treatment AE definition has been updated to account for the overlap between TEAEs and previous post-treatment AE definition.Shift from baseline to the worst value for lab parameters has been deleted.Total bilirubin upper limit updated.PK and antibodies data will only be listed.",

On entry to this study, patients will have inadequate glycemic control and will be either  antidiabetic drug-na\u00efve, defined as treatment with diet and exercise alone, or receiving treatment  with oral antidiabetic agent(s), either metformin, a sulfonylurea (SU), or a combination of  metformin and an SU (with or without diet and exercise).  Refer to Appendices 1 and 2 for schedules for both periods.  Reporting of treatment period data  may be performed before reporting of safety follow-up period data. ",

Treatment with insulin may be given for emergency reasons during the treatment period. If the period  of insulin use exceeds 10 days during a 3-month period, then a decision to discontinue study  treatment will be made after consultation between the investigator and the Sponsor\u2019s clinical research  physician.   Background oral antidiabetic medication (metformin and SU) were to be continued throughout the  study at the same dose and schedule as before study entry. However, metformin dosage could be  adjusted for up to 10 consecutive days or 10 days in a 30-day period and the SU dosage could be  decreased in response to hypoglycemia. Changes in background metformin and SU will be programmatically derived from the  concomitant therapy (CCT) oral anti-diabetic medication (OAM) CRFs and reviewed by the  clinical team prior to unblinding. Increases identified as potential rescue episodes will be queried  at the site-level to determine whether rescue therapy or not. New antidiabetic medication will be programmatically identified from the CCT OAM CRFs  where the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code begins with \u201cA10\u201d. A rescue episode will be defined as the first unique rescue therapy entry on the CCT OAM CRFs  as derived as above. If a patient has multiple entries, the first will be considered the point at  which the patient was rescued.  For patients who require initiation of rescue therapy and continue study treatment, only data  before initiation of rescue therapy will be included in the primary efficacy analysis. If HbA1c is  measured before rescue therapy, then we will include the HbA1c measurement. If HbA1c is  measured on the date of first rescue therapy but no time information is available, then HbA1c  will be included in the primary efficacy analysis. Sensitivity analyses including data after  initiation of rescue therapy will be carried out to test the robustness of the missing data  assumption. ",

The time of withdrawal is \nused in the definition of the pattern to allow the estimate to take account of the improvement \nover time that tends to be observed in all patients. By the end of the study earlier withdrawals are \nlikely to have improved somewhat more from their last observation, than late withdrawals. \nSpecifically, for patients who drop out after visit t, the change from baseline at visit t + n will be \nassumed to be the mean for visit t plus the difference in the means of the PBO group at visits t \nand t + n, given the study data. Then, the overall estimate of treatment effect is obtained by \naveraging the estimates across the dropout patterns, according to the proportions of dropouts \noccurring at each visit. Note that in this analysis, PBO missing observations are imputed \nassuming MAR and follow the pattern of observed PBO observations, and missings for the Total \nEBID group are assumed MNAR.\nIn summary, the pattern mixture models will be implemented by multiple imputation via the \nfollowing steps; \nStep 1: Non-monotone missing data (usually relatively infrequent) will be imputed using the \nMCMC option of SAS PROC MI with treatment, baseline HbA1c, background diabetes \ntherapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, and metformin +SU) and value of the \nendpoint at each visit. This will create a monotone missing pattern in the dataset within each \ntreatment group. This step will create 1000 imputed datasets. \nStep 2: The values for each pattern will be imputed via the chained equation method, using SAS \nPROC MI option MONOTONE REG (). The MNAR imputation is achieved by using only \nappropriate study data for each pattern. For example, to impute for time t if the EBID missing data \nhas the trajectory of PBO, include only PBO observations up to and including time t, plus only \nobservations from patients in the EBID group that have observations up to but not beyond time t-\n1. First, all missings for the first post-baseline visit are imputed, then missings for the next visit \nare imputed using observed data plus the missings just imputed; and so on to the final visit. The \ncovariates used in the model will be baseline HbA1c, background diabetes therapy strata (drug \nna\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, and metformin +SU) and HbA1c measured at time t-1.\nStep 3: The imputed data from Step 1 and Step 2, along with observed data will be analyzed \nusing an MMRM model for the outcome of change from baseline  with treatment, baseline \nHbA1c, background diabetes therapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, and \nmetformin +SU), week of visit, baseline HbA1c-by-week interaction and treatment-by-week \ninteraction as the fixed effects. The variance - covariance structure to be used for this \nmodelling will be unstructured (UN). The estimates from multiple imputed datasets will be \ncombined using Rubin\u2019s combination rules for statistical inference (Rubin, 1987) using PROC \nMI ANALYZE.\nThe seed used will be 88281 for both steps 1 and 2.\nAt Step 1, if a categorical covariate has more than 2 levels, then dummy coding has to be \nperformed to present it as either 0/1 or 1/2. If categorical variable has X categories (X>2) then \nwe would create X-1 dummy variables, using the rule described in the table below.\n",

The denominator will be the total number of Evaluable patients in the \ntreatment group, and the numerator will be the number of patients achieving HbA1c <7%, \n\u22646.5%, and <6.5%. \nAs a sensitivity analysis, also in the Evaluable analysis set, the probabilities of patients reaching \nHbA1c targets of <7%, \u22646.5%, and <6.5% will be analyzed to Week 28 using the CMH \nprocedure, with missing data imputed using MI pattern mixture model imputation. HbA1c and \nbackground diabetes therapy strata will serve as the stratification factors. The imputed HbA1c \ndata for the sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be used for this analysis.\nSimilar outputs (bar chart including p-values and summary of the numbers and percentage of \npatients having HbA1c goals by visit and treatment group) will be produced for the Evaluable \nanalysis set for this sensitivity analysis.   \nChange in body weight, FSG and FSI from baseline Visit 3 (Week 0)\nThe same MMRM approach (as used for the primary analysis) will be used to analyze the change \nin body weight from baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) to Week 28, and each intermediate visit. Baseline \nbody weight will replace baseline HbA1c and screening HbA1c strata will be included in these \nmodels.\nSince only baseline and endpoint FSG and FSI measurements are collected, these endpoints will \nbe analyzed by multiple imputation based on the assumption that missing data are MAR via the \nfollowing steps:\nStep 1: Non-monotone missing data (expected to be infrequent) will be imputed using the \nMCMC option of SAS PROC MI with treatment, baseline FSG/FSI, screening HbA1c strata \n(\uf0a38% and >8%) and background diabetes therapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, \nand metformin +SU) and value of the endpoint at each visit. This will create a monotone \nmissing pattern in the dataset within each treatment group. This step will create 1000 imputed \ndatasets. \nStep 2: After a monotone missing pattern is created for the data, PROC MI using MONOTONE \nREGRESSION will be used to impute missing post-baseline values. The covariates used in the \nmodel will be treatment, baseline FSG/FSI, screening HbA1c strata (\uf0a38% and >8%) and \nbackground diabetes therapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, and metformin +SU) \nand value of the endpoint at each visit. This is MAR imputation.\n36\nStep 3: The imputed data from Step 1 and Step 2, along with observed data will be analyzed \nusing separate ANCOVA models for each imputed dataset with change from baseline in \nFSG/FSI as the dependent variable and  treatment, baseline FSG/FSI, screening HbA1c strata \n(\uf0a38% and >8%) and background diabetes therapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, \nand metformin +SU) as fixed effects.

The number of imputed datasets may be \nreduced depending on the extent of missing data.\nThe residuals from the ANCOVA model will be plotted against the quartiles from standard \nNormal distribution for each of the imputed datasets. A Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov normality test \nwill be conducted for the residuals. If deviation from normality is noted in the ANCOVA model \nor imputation diagnostics including trace and autocorrelation plots indicate issues with the \nmultiple imputation then alternative approaches will be discussed e.g. analysis of variance \n(ANOVA), number of imputed datasets etc. \nActual values and change from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics by visit \nand treatment group for the Full analysis set. OC summaries will be provided where appropriate. \nBody weight, FSG and FSI measures will be listed.\nChange in SMBG measurements from baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) \nIn both the seven days prior to Visit 3 (Week 0) and the seven days prior to Visit 11 (Week 28), \npatients will be asked to perform 4-point SMBG profiles (pre- and 2-hour post-prandial \nmeasurements at the 2 main meals of the day) on 3 separate days. SMBG profiles will be \nsummarized as follows.\nOnly complete pairs of pre-prandial and post-prandial SMBG concentrations will be used. If \nmeasurements are taken for more than 2 main meals of the day, then the latest 2 meals of the day \nwill be used that have both a pre-prandial and post-prandial measurement. If measurements were \ntaken on more than 3 separate days in a period, then the latest 3 days of measurements that have \nboth a pre-prandial and post-prandial measurement prior to the visit will be used. If data are \nmissing for a meal, then the remaining available data will be used.  Thus, summary measures \nwill be calculated provided the patient had a least one complete pair of measurements in the \nperiod.\nMean SMBG will be calculated as the mean of SMBG concentrations (pre- and post-prandial) \nover the 2 main meals over 3 separate days, where complete pairs of both pre-prandial and post-\nprandial measurements for a given meal are present. Mean SMBG at baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) \nand Visit 11 (Week 28) as well as the change in overall daily mean from baseline Visit 3 (Week \n0) to Visit 11 (Week 28) will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group for \nthe Full analysis set.\nPost-prandial excursions will be calculated as the difference between the pre-prandial and post-\nprandial blood glucose concentrations (post-prandial \u2013 pre-prandial) and averaged (mean) over \nthe 2 main meals over the 3 separate days in each period. Mean post-prandial excursions at \n37\nbaseline Visit 3 (Week 0) and Visit 11 (Week 28) as well as the change from baseline values will \nbe summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group. \nThe mean pre-prandial (post-prandial) SMBG concentration will be defined as the average \n(mean) measurement over the 2 main meals over 3 separate days in each period.  Mean pre-\nprandial (post-prandial) SMBG concentrations at baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) and Visit 11 (Week \n28) as well as the change from baseline values will be summarized using descriptive statistics by \ntreatment group.\nThe same multiple imputation ANCOVA approach (as used for the analysis of FSG and FSI) \nwill be used to analyze change from baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) to Visit 11 (Week 28) for each of \nthe 4 SMBG summary measures (overall, pre-prandial, post-prandial, post-prandial excursions). \nChange in beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) from baseline \nVisit 3 (Week 0) to Visit 11 (Week 28)\nThe effects of the study medications on HOMA will be examined. The pancreatic beta-cell \nfunction (HOMA-B) and peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) will be computed \nfrom a computerized HOMA model, the HOMA Calculator (Matthews et al 1985). The HOMA \nCalculator, developed by Diabetes Trials Unit at the Oxford Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology, \nand Metabolism, is a computer algorithm that takes account of variations in hepatic and \nperipheral glucose resistance, increases in the insulin secretion curve for plasma glucose \nconcentrations above 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL), and the contribution of circulating proinsulin \n(e.g., C-peptide) to estimate the steady state beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity, as \npercentages of a normal reference population. The model assumes %HOMA-B and %HOMA-S \nvalues of 100% in normal young adults as a recalibration. \nHOMA parameters will be log transformed (natural logarithmic transformation). The observed \nvalues and change from baseline for these parameters will be summarized by visit using \ndescriptive statistics (n, geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation: GCV%, geometric \nstandard deviation factor: GSD, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation: \nCV%, median, minimum and maximum value) for the Full analysis set. \nThe same multiple imputation ANCOVA approach (as used for the analysis of FSG and FSI) \nwill be used to analyze change from baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) to Visit 11 (Week 28) for HOMA-\nB and HOMA-S.\nAll HOMA parameters will be analyzed on a logarithmic scale (natural logarithmic \ntransformation), and then back-transformed to the original scale for result presentation using the \nfollowing formulae:\nGeometric Mean= exp(mean(log (X)))\nSE of Geometric Mean = Geometric Mean* SE of Mean (log (X))\nLS means will be back-transformed in the same way.\nSeparate tables of back-transformed and non-transformed results will be provided.\nHomeostasis results will be listed.\nProportions of patients discontinuing the study due to failure to maintain glycemic control \nat Visit 11 (Week 28), and at each intermediate visit\n",
