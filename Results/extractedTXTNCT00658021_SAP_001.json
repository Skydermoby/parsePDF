        "Content": "DateBrief description of change22th April 2020Due to change of company for the analysis of this study from Amylin Pharmaceuticals, LLC to IQVIA, the Statistical Analysis Plan has been fully rewritten from Version 1.0.Rewritten to be consistent with Study D5551C00002 where appropriate.Summaries and analysis of long-term safety follow-up period included.Due to power considerations, efficacy analysis comparisons will be between both exenatide treatment arms combined versus placebo. Updated to allow for possibility of analysis of treatment period data and safety follow-up period data separatelyImportant Protocol Deviation #1 has been amended to consider screening time, rather than enrolment.Baseline definition and end of study treatment measurement have been updated.Columns for the EBID treatment groups have been swapped.Updated to only consider informed consent, and not assent.Race and Region has been updated.Ethnic group has been deleted.Country has been sorted in alphabetical order.Medications will be presented for ITT and safety follow-up analysis set.MI definition has been extended and additional table for primary analysis has been added.Post-treatment AE definition has been updated to account for the overlap between TEAEs and previous post-treatment AE definition.Shift from baseline to the worst value for lab parameters has been deleted.Total bilirubin upper limit updated.PK and antibodies data will only be listed.",

The simplified lifestyle modification program will include both dietary \neducation and physical activity components.  At the clinic visits, the patients will meet with a \nregistered dietitian (RD) or certified diabetes educator (CDE) who will review the patient\u2019s \ndietary history and physical activity record.  The LMP will be reinforced at each visit.\nPatients who have discontinued the study due to loss of glycemic control will be offered \nalternative antidiabetic therapy at the discretion of the investigator.\nIn response to a request from the European Medicines Agency Pediatric Committee, patients will \nbe observed in a long-term safety follow-up period following discontinuation of study drug \nadministration. Patients will return to the clinic every 6 months for evaluation of safety \nmeasures. Patients will be followed for up to 3 years after the completion of the treatment period, \nor until the difference between 2 consecutive height measurements at 6-month intervals is less \nthan 5mm (whichever occurs first). Patients who have achieved the final height requirement of a \nchange of less than 5mm between Visit 3 (Week 0) and Visit 11 (Week 28/Early \nDiscontinuation) of the treatment period will be excluded from the safety-follow up period. \nPatients who do not have height assessments at study-site visits over a 6-month interval prior to \ndiscontinuation of study medication will enter the safety follow-up period. \n",

The time of withdrawal is \nused in the definition of the pattern to allow the estimate to take account of the improvement \nover time that tends to be observed in all patients. By the end of the study earlier withdrawals are \nlikely to have improved somewhat more from their last observation, than late withdrawals. \nSpecifically, for patients who drop out after visit t, the change from baseline at visit t + n will be \nassumed to be the mean for visit t plus the difference in the means of the PBO group at visits t \nand t + n, given the study data. Then, the overall estimate of treatment effect is obtained by \naveraging the estimates across the dropout patterns, according to the proportions of dropouts \noccurring at each visit. Note that in this analysis, PBO missing observations are imputed \nassuming MAR and follow the pattern of observed PBO observations, and missings for the Total \nEBID group are assumed MNAR.\nIn summary, the pattern mixture models will be implemented by multiple imputation via the \nfollowing steps; \nStep 1: Non-monotone missing data (usually relatively infrequent) will be imputed using the \nMCMC option of SAS PROC MI with treatment, baseline HbA1c, background diabetes \ntherapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, and metformin +SU) and value of the \nendpoint at each visit. This will create a monotone missing pattern in the dataset within each \ntreatment group. This step will create 1000 imputed datasets. \nStep 2: The values for each pattern will be imputed via the chained equation method, using SAS \nPROC MI option MONOTONE REG (). The MNAR imputation is achieved by using only \nappropriate study data for each pattern. For example, to impute for time t if the EBID missing data \nhas the trajectory of PBO, include only PBO observations up to and including time t, plus only \nobservations from patients in the EBID group that have observations up to but not beyond time t-\n1. First, all missings for the first post-baseline visit are imputed, then missings for the next visit \nare imputed using observed data plus the missings just imputed; and so on to the final visit. The \ncovariates used in the model will be baseline HbA1c, background diabetes therapy strata (drug \nna\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, and metformin +SU) and HbA1c measured at time t-1.\nStep 3: The imputed data from Step 1 and Step 2, along with observed data will be analyzed \nusing an MMRM model for the outcome of change from baseline  with treatment, baseline \nHbA1c, background diabetes therapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, and \nmetformin +SU), week of visit, baseline HbA1c-by-week interaction and treatment-by-week \ninteraction as the fixed effects. The variance - covariance structure to be used for this \nmodelling will be unstructured (UN). The estimates from multiple imputed datasets will be \ncombined using Rubin\u2019s combination rules for statistical inference (Rubin, 1987) using PROC \nMI ANALYZE.\nThe seed used will be 88281 for both steps 1 and 2.\nAt Step 1, if a categorical covariate has more than 2 levels, then dummy coding has to be \nperformed to present it as either 0/1 or 1/2. If categorical variable has X categories (X>2) then \nwe would create X-1 dummy variables, using the rule described in the table below.\n",

The denominator will be the total number of Evaluable patients in the \ntreatment group, and the numerator will be the number of patients achieving HbA1c <7%, \n\u22646.5%, and <6.5%. \nAs a sensitivity analysis, also in the Evaluable analysis set, the probabilities of patients reaching \nHbA1c targets of <7%, \u22646.5%, and <6.5% will be analyzed to Week 28 using the CMH \nprocedure, with missing data imputed using MI pattern mixture model imputation.

This step will create 1000 imputed \ndatasets. \nStep 2: After a monotone missing pattern is created for the data, PROC MI using MONOTONE \nREGRESSION will be used to impute missing post-baseline values. The covariates used in the \nmodel will be treatment, baseline FSG/FSI, screening HbA1c strata (\uf0a38% and >8%) and \nbackground diabetes therapy strata (drug na\u00efve, metformin only, SU only, and metformin +SU) \nand value of the endpoint at each visit.

The number of imputed datasets may be \nreduced depending on the extent of missing data.\nThe residuals from the ANCOVA model will be plotted against the quartiles from standard \nNormal distribution for each of the imputed datasets. A Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov normality test \nwill be conducted for the residuals. If deviation from normality is noted in the ANCOVA model \nor imputation diagnostics including trace and autocorrelation plots indicate issues with the \nmultiple imputation then alternative approaches will be discussed e.g. analysis of variance \n(ANOVA), number of imputed datasets etc. \nActual values and change from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics by visit \nand treatment group for the Full analysis set. OC summaries will be provided where appropriate. \nBody weight, FSG and FSI measures will be listed.\nChange in SMBG measurements from baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) \nIn both the seven days prior to Visit 3 (Week 0) and the seven days prior to Visit 11 (Week 28), \npatients will be asked to perform 4-point SMBG profiles (pre- and 2-hour post-prandial \nmeasurements at the 2 main meals of the day) on 3 separate days. SMBG profiles will be \nsummarized as follows.\nOnly complete pairs of pre-prandial and post-prandial SMBG concentrations will be used. If \nmeasurements are taken for more than 2 main meals of the day, then the latest 2 meals of the day \nwill be used that have both a pre-prandial and post-prandial measurement. If measurements were \ntaken on more than 3 separate days in a period, then the latest 3 days of measurements that have \nboth a pre-prandial and post-prandial measurement prior to the visit will be used. If data are \nmissing for a meal, then the remaining available data will be used.  Thus, summary measures \nwill be calculated provided the patient had a least one complete pair of measurements in the \nperiod.\nMean SMBG will be calculated as the mean of SMBG concentrations (pre- and post-prandial) \nover the 2 main meals over 3 separate days, where complete pairs of both pre-prandial and post-\nprandial measurements for a given meal are present. Mean SMBG at baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) \nand Visit 11 (Week 28) as well as the change in overall daily mean from baseline Visit 3 (Week \n0) to Visit 11 (Week 28) will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group for \nthe Full analysis set.\nPost-prandial excursions will be calculated as the difference between the pre-prandial and post-\nprandial blood glucose concentrations (post-prandial \u2013 pre-prandial) and averaged (mean) over \nthe 2 main meals over the 3 separate days in each period. Mean post-prandial excursions at \n37\nbaseline Visit 3 (Week 0) and Visit 11 (Week 28) as well as the change from baseline values will \nbe summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group. \nThe mean pre-prandial (post-prandial) SMBG concentration will be defined as the average \n(mean) measurement over the 2 main meals over 3 separate days in each period.  Mean pre-\nprandial (post-prandial) SMBG concentrations at baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) and Visit 11 (Week \n28) as well as the change from baseline values will be summarized using descriptive statistics by \ntreatment group.\nThe same multiple imputation ANCOVA approach (as used for the analysis of FSG and FSI) \nwill be used to analyze change from baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) to Visit 11 (Week 28) for each of \nthe 4 SMBG summary measures (overall, pre-prandial, post-prandial, post-prandial excursions). \nChange in beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) from baseline \nVisit 3 (Week 0) to Visit 11 (Week 28)\nThe effects of the study medications on HOMA will be examined. The pancreatic beta-cell \nfunction (HOMA-B) and peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) will be computed \nfrom a computerized HOMA model, the HOMA Calculator (Matthews et al 1985). The HOMA \nCalculator, developed by Diabetes Trials Unit at the Oxford Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology, \nand Metabolism, is a computer algorithm that takes account of variations in hepatic and \nperipheral glucose resistance, increases in the insulin secretion curve for plasma glucose \nconcentrations above 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL), and the contribution of circulating proinsulin \n(e.g., C-peptide) to estimate the steady state beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity, as \npercentages of a normal reference population. The model assumes %HOMA-B and %HOMA-S \nvalues of 100% in normal young adults as a recalibration. \nHOMA parameters will be log transformed (natural logarithmic transformation). The observed \nvalues and change from baseline for these parameters will be summarized by visit using \ndescriptive statistics (n, geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation: GCV%, geometric \nstandard deviation factor: GSD, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation: \nCV%, median, minimum and maximum value) for the Full analysis set. \nThe same multiple imputation ANCOVA approach (as used for the analysis of FSG and FSI) \nwill be used to analyze change from baseline Visit 3 (Week 0) to Visit 11 (Week 28) for HOMA-\nB and HOMA-S.\nAll HOMA parameters will be analyzed on a logarithmic scale (natural logarithmic \ntransformation), and then back-transformed to the original scale for result presentation using the \nfollowing formulae:\nGeometric Mean= exp(mean(log (X)))\nSE of Geometric Mean = Geometric Mean* SE of Mean (log (X))\nLS means will be back-transformed in the same way.\nSeparate tables of back-transformed and non-transformed results will be provided.\nHomeostasis results will be listed.\nProportions of patients discontinuing the study due to failure to maintain glycemic control \nat Visit 11 (Week 28), and at each intermediate visit\n",
