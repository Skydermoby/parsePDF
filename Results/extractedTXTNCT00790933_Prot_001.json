For subjects who do not transition into the XAP study, the dosing period will be followed by a 16-week posttreatment observation and safety assessment period.  Patients may receive allowed concomitant medications for the treatment of IBD as detailed in Section 6.2.1, as determined by the principal investigator, at any time point during the study. Medications may be discontinued during the study, but if discontinuation is planned, it should be done prior to the first dose of vedolizumab. It is strongly recommended that patients receiving oral corticosteroids should begin an oral corticosteroid tapering regimen once they achieve clinical response or if, in the opinion of the investigator, they demonstrate sufficient improvement in clinical signs and symptoms.  Patients who require rescue medication or major surgery for the treatment of their IBD (as defined in Section 6.4.9) or who, in the opinion of the investigator or patient, are not benefiting from therapy will be withdrawn from the study. Investigators should also strongly consider withdrawing patients who require recurrent courses of oral corticosteroids with an inability to taper.Vedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n6\nSafety assessments, including safety labs, and exploratory efficacy assessments (using the partial \nMayo Score [for patients with UC] or the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) score [for patients with \nCD]) will be made throughout the treatment period, and at the Final Safety visit.  Serious adverse \nevents (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) will be collected throughout the study (as applicable).  \nFor patients enrolling to the XAP study, AEs/SAEs and concomitant medications will be collected \nuntil in Study C13008 the patient is consented into the XAP study.  Data pertaining to health care \nutilization and patient-reported outcomes will also be collected regularly throughout the study.  In \naddition, safety data from this study will be benchmarked with data from external databases.\nStudy Population:\nMost patients enrolling in this study will have participated in a previous qualifying MLN0002 \nstudy (rollover patients):\n\uf0b7\nPatients with UC or CD who participated in the phase 2, open-label, long-term \nsafety study (Study C13004) \n\uf0b7\nPatients who withdrew early from a phase 3 UC or CD induction and maintenance \nstudy (Study C13006 or Study C13007)  due to sustained nonresponse, disease \nworsening, or the need for rescue medications\n\uf0b7\nPatients who completed Study C13006, Study C13007, or Study C13011\nIn addition, up to 400 patients without previous treatment with vedolizumab may be enrolled \ndirectly  (de novo patients):\n\uf0b7\nPatients with UC or CD who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for de novo \npatients\nNumber of Study Center(s):  approximately 400 sites worldwide; de novo patients will be \nenrolled at approximately 150 of the existing sites.\nDuration of Study:\nIt is anticipated that the duration of MLN0002 treatment will vary by patient based on continued \nbenefit.  Treatment duration may continue until July 2017, or until XAP study is available at the \nsite, or until patient withdrawal, or until vedolizumab is available to the patient through \ncommercial channels (including reimbursement) for the patient\u2019s clinical scenario, or unless the \nstudy is terminated early by the sponsor, as described in Section 11.12, whichever is sooner.  After \nthe final dose of MLN0002, patients who do not transition into the XAP study will complete the \n16-week post treatment observation and assessment period.  Additionally, upon completion of or \ntermination from this study, patients will participate in a 2-year follow-up survey during which \ntime a safety questionnaire will be administered by telephone. Patients who transition into the \nXAP study are not required to attend the Final Safety Visit of C13008.  The safety of these \npatients will be monitored as part of the XAP study.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n7\nStudy Diagram:  Sources of Study Participants\nStudy C13004\npatients with UC or CD;

While highly \neffective for induction of remission, corticosteroids are not useful in either disease for \nmaintenance of remission and carry significant undesirable side effects, including \nosteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and increased risk of infection.\nImmunomodulatory agents, including 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, have a role in \nmaintenance of remission in moderate to severe UC and moderate to severe CD.  Their \nrelatively slow onset of action precludes their use during flares of disease, and the use of \nthese agents has been reported to potentially increase the risk of lymphoma in patients with \nIBD.(7)  Intravenous cyclosporine has a role in the management of severe UC; however, it is \nimpractical in nonhospitalized patients, requires intense monitoring, and may cause \nirreversible nephrotoxicity, all of which limit its use to severe cases.  Methotrexate, while \nineffective in UC, has a role in the management of refractory CD; however, it also \ndemonstrates a number of dose-limiting toxicities.  Antibiotics have marginal efficacy in \nmaintenance of remission in CD and are not effective in UC.\nBiologic agents, including monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha \n(TNF\uf061), such as infliximab (Remicade\u00ae) and adalimumab (Humira\u00ae), have been studied and \nhave proven useful for both induction and maintenance of remission in CD.  Infliximab is \nalso useful for induction and maintenance of remission in UC.  However, only \napproximately one-third of patients have a sustained remission at 1 year following treatment \nwith these agents.  In addition, treatment with TNF\uf061antagonists has been associated with a \nnumber of serious adverse events (SAEs) involving hypersensitivity and infection.  \nReactivations of latent tuberculosis (TB)(8) and disseminated histoplasmosis have been \nreported, and in some cases have been fatal.(9)  Induction of remission with infliximab \noccurs in only 31% to 39% of patients with UC(10) and durable clinical remission (at 1 year) \noccurs in only 26% of patients with UC.  Efficacy data for both infliximab and adalimumab \nin CD are quite similar to the infliximab data in UC with only a minority of patients having \na durable response at 1 year.(11, 12)\nFailure of medical therapy leads to colectomy in 9% to 35% of patients with UC within \n5 years.  Colectomy is considered to be an important adjunct treatment for refractory UC; \nhowever, colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (the standard surgical therapy) has \nmany limitations and is associated with its own set of complications, including high stool \nfrequency,(13) female infertility,(14) and a cumulative incidence of pouchitis of 50% at \n10 years.(15)  Surgical removal of highly diseased, strictured, or stenotic segments of bowel \n",

The current experience with vedolizumab, based on review of \ndata from the blinded safety data in Studies C13006, C13007, C13011, and from the \nopen-label study C13008, is consistent with the findings as detailed in the IB.  The phase 3 \ntrials are also independently monitored for safety as described below. \nIn the completed studies, overall, percentages of subjects who reported AEs and SAEs, or \nwho discontinued due to an adverse event (AE), were similar between MLN0002- and \nplacebo-treated groups.  Throughout the MLN0002 program, there has been no overt \nrelationship between dose and specific AEs.\nThe safety profile of MLN0002 in the target patient populations is generally reflective of the \nindication under study.  That is, there are more reports of GI events in patients with IBD \n(UC, CD) compared with the experience in healthy subjects.  Baseline disease activity in \npatients with IBD did not influence the overall rate of AEs, although SAEs, severe AEs, and \ndiscontinuations due to AEs were reported more commonly in patients with more severe \ndisease activity regardless of whether they received MLN0002 or placebo.\nPatients in the completed and ongoing trials have been and are closely monitored for \ninfection.\nAdditionally, in the completed studies, an analysis of concomitant use of \nimmunosuppressants (ie, corticosteroids, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], \nmethotrexate, cyclosporine, or infliximab within 90 days of patients\u2019 last dose of study drug) \nhas not identified an acute, additive risk of infection attributable to MLN0002. \nSimilarly, concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or conventional immunomodulators does \nnot appear to be associated with a clinically meaningful increased rate of infections based on \nthe comparative rates of infections in the blinded phase 3 trials among patients who have \nand have not received these medications.  \nAs shown in Table 1-1, overall rates of infection are relatively constant regardless of the use \nof these concomitant medications. Most infections (by preferred term) were reported by \neither 1 or 2 individuals, and no trends were observed when comparing the blinded \naggregate data from C13006 and C13007 to the open-label experience (C13008). \nConcomitant use of these medications does not appear to be associated with any increased \nrate of specific infections.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n28\nTable 1-1   \nOverview of Subjects Reporting at Least 1 Infection According to \nConcomitant Medication Use\nStudy Population\nC13006\nn/N (%)\nC13007\nn/N (%)\nC13008\nn/N (%)\nAll patients\n56/300  (19)\n100/454 (22)\n32/203  (16)\nNeither steroids or immunomodulators\n19/94 (20)\n40/169 (24)\n17/135 (13)\nSteroids only\n19/106 (18)\n29/143 (20)\n10/43 (23)\nImmunomodulator only\n5/30 (13)\n16/76 (21)\n2/13 (15)\nBoth steroids and immunomodulators\n13/60 (22)\n15/66 (23)\n3/12 (25)\nEither steroids, immunomodulators or both\n37/206 (18)\n60/285 (21)\n15/68 (22)\nAny steroids (with or without immunomodulators)\n32/166 (19)\n44/209 (21)\n13/55 (24)\nAny immunomodulator (with or without steroids)\n18/100 (18)\n31/142 (22)\n5/25 (20)\nIn addition, all patients enrolled in the vedolizumab trials are actively monitored for \nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) through the Risk Assessment and \nMinimization for PML (RAMP) program. No cases of PML have been reported in any \nclinical trial. \nDeaths have occurred in patients participating in MLN0002 clinical trials, 2 of which were \nthought to be related to the study drug by the treating physicians.  However, the treating \nphysicians do not know if these subjects received MLN0002 or placebo.\nThe phase 3 vedolizumab clinical program is overseen by an independent Data Safety \nMonitoring Board (DSMB) composed of 2 gastroenterologists, an infectious diseases \nphysician, a physician with training in epidemiology, and a statistician. The DSMB reviews \nall SAEs monthly and unblinded safety data from all phase 3 trials every 6 months at a \nminimum. The DSMB convened on 13 December 2011, and after reviewing unblinded \nsafety data, recommended that the trials proceed without modification.\nIn conclusion, substantial clinical exposures to vedolizumab have been accrued in patients\nwith moderate to severe IBD, and the clinical safety experience with vedolizumab has been\nconsistent with its mechanism of action as a selective integrin antagonist.  In consideration \nof the greater severity of disease of patients enrolled in the phase 3 studies, the overall safety \nprofile of vedolizumab (MLN0002) remains consistent with the favorable safety experience \nin the phase 2 trials, and remains compatible with vedolizumab\u2019s gut-selective \nanti-inflammatory effects. \n",

This selection is based on the phase 2 \nfindings that 2 mg/kg MLN0002 administered every 4 weeks as induction therapy was an \nefficacious dose for both UC and CD, but that maximal efficacy may not have been \nachieved.  Also, formation of HAHA following MLN0002 treatment has an inverse dose \nrelationship, with higher doses within the tested range having a suppressive effect on \nimmunogenicity (refer to the IB).  Therefore, doses higher than those that might ordinarily \nbe acceptable short-term in the absence of HAHA are required to sustain remission \nthroughout the dosing interval.  Therefore, as a strategy to maximally suppress HAHA \nformation with MLN0002, 300 mg MLN0002 will be administered every 4 weeks.  \nMLN0002 treatment was generally well tolerated in 79 healthy subjects and patients with \nIBD that were treated with doses and/or dose regimens resulting in concentrations that \nexceed the median predicted steady-state MLN0002 peak and trough concentrations for the \nproposed dose (300 mg MLN0002 administered every 4 weeks).  The favorable safety \nprofile of MLN0002 doses up to 10 mg/kg supports selection of this dose for evaluation in \nthis study (for additional details, see Section 1.3.2).\n",

The \nimmunomodulatory mechanism of vedolizumab, as a selective \uf0614\uf0627 integrin antagonist, may \nnot predispose patients to an increased risk of PML.  Nevertheless, all ongoing vedolizumab \nclinical studies will use the RAMP program as a Risk Minimization Action Plan for PML.  \nThe RAMP program minimizes the risk of PML by focusing on early clinical detection and \nmanagement of PML, including discontinuation of study drug, if applicable.  An \nindependent adjudication committee (IAC) has been established as part of the RAMP \nprogram to review possible cases of PML and will provide input regarding patient \nevaluation and management as defined in the IAC charter.  Additional details of the RAMP \nprogram are in the Study Manual.  Plasmapheresis and mefloquine have been reported as \npotentially efficacious treatments for natalizumab-associated PML.(25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30)\nPatients are assessed for signs and symptoms of PML before the administration of each dose \nof study drug using a PML subjective symptom checklist.  Patients with a positive PML \nsubjective symptom checklist at any time after enrollment in an MLN0002 clinical study \nwill be evaluated according to a prespecified algorithm (the PML Case Evaluation \nAlgorithm, provided in the Study Manual).  The next dose of study drug will be held until \nthe evaluation is complete and results are available.  Subsequent doses of study drug will be \nadministered only if the possibility of PML is definitively excluded, as described in the \nRAMP algorithm. The IAC will review new neurological signs and symptoms potentially \nconsistent with PML and will provide input regarding patient evaluation and management as \ndefined in the IAC charter.  \nTo ensure the success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the \nfeatures of PML, and patients will be trained to report specific neurological signs and \nsymptoms without delay.  Educational materials for teaching site personnel and patients \nabout PML and the RAMP procedures will be distributed to all sites.  Formal teaching and \ntraining will be performed for site personnel before the start of the study.  Patients will \nreceive training and educational materials before enrollment.  The ICF will contain specific\ninformation on the hypothetical risk of PML.\nThe PML IAC will be informed of all new neurological signs and symptoms potentially \nconsistent with PML per the PML Case Evaluation Algorithm and will review the individual \npatient data.  The algorithm and tools are included in the Study Manual.\n",

Further details are provided in the current IB.\n1.4   Study Rationale\nEstablishing the long-term safety and tolerability of MLN0002 is a key component of the \npivotal development programs in both UC and CD.  From this long-term open-label study of \nactive MLN0002 therapy, data regarding the occurrence of important clinical events \nresulting from chronic MLN0002 administration will be obtained.  Important clinical events \nincluding those related to safety (eg, opportunistic infections, malignancy, long-term \nimmunogenicity profile) as well as efficacy (eg, maintenance of remission, quality of life, \nand various other health outcomes measures) will be collected.  The probability of \nexperiencing uncommon safety events that occur at a frequency on the order of \n1/100-1/1500 that might not ordinarily be detected in year-long induction and maintenance \nstudies may be estimated from this study data.  The probability of detecting at least \n1 uncommon adverse event with 2000 patients will be 0.9999, 0.9818, 0.8648, and 0.6322 \nwhen the true rates are 1/100, 1/500, 1/1000, and 1/2000, respectively.\nThis study will allow patients with prior enrollment in a qualifying MLN0002 study \n(rollover patients, as detailed in Section 4.1) to receive long-term MLN0002 treatment. \nAlthough the study was due to complete in December 2016, Takeda has agreed to extend the \ntreatment period until July 2017 to allow continued access for patients in countries where \nvedolizumab is either not commercially available or is not reimbursed, or for which the XAP \nstudy is not yet available at the site. For this reason, this amendment is being submitted in all \ncountries currently following Amendment 16 except the following: Austria, France, \nGermany, Israel, Netherlands, Norway,  Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United \nKingdom.  Current safety information is available in the latest version of the Investigator \nBrochure. \nA control group has not been included in this study based on the following considerations.  \nFirst, since the observed rates of rare safety events such as those listed above can be \nestimated from an observational study, a controlled study is unnecessary.  Second, most of \nthe patients participating in this long-term safety study will have participated in a previous \nMLN0002 study in which they may have been randomized to placebo therapy; therefore, the \nopportunity for these patients to receive active treatment should not be unnecessarily \ndelayed.  Third, data from the study will be benchmarked with data from external databases \n(see Section 8.7 for further details on safety analyses that will be performed).  \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n30\nUC disease activity will be followed throughout this study using the partial Mayo score, a \nstandardized measure for UC trials that includes 3 of the 4 components of the complete \nMayo score.(10) CD disease activity will be followed throughout this study using the \nHarvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), a standardized measure for CD trials that has previously \nbeen demonstrated to correlate highly with the Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI).(24)  \nExploratory efficacy outcomes such as clinical remission, clinical response, and decrease in \ncorticosteroid use will be assessed in subgroups of patients to whom these endpoints are \nrelevant.\nDose Selection Rationale\nThe strategy for dose selection in this phase 3 study was based on the following parameters:\n\uf0b7\nClinical efficacy and dose response in phase 2 \n\uf0b7\nSuppression of human anti-human antibody (HAHA) formation\n\uf0b7\nSerum concentration of MLN0002 at the efficacious doses in phase 2 trials \n(pharmacokinetic considerations)\n\uf0b7\nMaintenance of \uf0614\uf0627 receptor saturation (pharmacodynamic considerations)\nA dose of 300 mg MLN0002 (roughly equivalent to 4 mg/kg MLN0002 for a 75 kg patient) \nevery 4 weeks has been selected for evaluation.  This selection is based on the phase 2 \nfindings that 2 mg/kg MLN0002 administered every 4 weeks as induction therapy was an \nefficacious dose for both UC and CD, but that maximal efficacy may not have been \nachieved.  Also, formation of HAHA following MLN0002 treatment has an inverse dose \nrelationship, with higher doses within the tested range having a suppressive effect on \nimmunogenicity (refer to the IB).  Therefore, doses higher than those that might ordinarily \nbe acceptable short-term in the absence of HAHA are required to sustain remission \nthroughout the dosing interval.  Therefore, as a strategy to maximally suppress HAHA \nformation with MLN0002, 300 mg MLN0002 will be administered every 4 weeks.  \nMLN0002 treatment was generally well tolerated in 79 healthy subjects and patients with \nIBD that were treated with doses and/or dose regimens resulting in concentrations that \nexceed the median predicted steady-state MLN0002 peak and trough concentrations for the \nproposed dose (300 mg MLN0002 administered every 4 weeks).  The favorable safety \nprofile of MLN0002 doses up to 10 mg/kg supports selection of this dose for evaluation in \nthis study (for additional details, see Section 1.3.2).\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n31\nA dose of 300 mg MLN0002 every 4 weeks is expected to suppress immunogenicity during \nmultiple dosing, thereby maintaining sufficient MLN0002 exposure and \uf0614\uf0627 receptor \nsaturation throughout the dosing interval which, in previous efficacy studies, have been \nshown to result in clinical efficacy.  It is also one of the dose regimens currently being \nevaluated in the phase 3 induction and maintenance Studies C13006 and C13007 and the \ninduction Study C13011.  This long-term safety study will provide additional supportive \ndata for 300 mg MLN0002 administered every 4 weeks in patients with IBD and will ensure \nan adequate safety database for the eventual registration of MLN0002 in UC and CD.  \n1.5   Potential Risks and Benefits\nAs described in Section 1.3, 2 well-powered, phase 2 studies have shown the benefit of \nMLN0002 treatment in inducing response and remission in UC and CD.  An integrated \nsafety analysis was conducted using data from completed and unblinded clinical trials as of \n16 April 2010.  This analysis of 742 healthy subjects and patients with IBD, of whom \n560 received at least 1 dose of MLN0002, demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for \nMLN0002. Thus, MLN0002 has a favorable risk to benefit profile to date.  Section 10.5\ndescribes the comprehensive risk management program for this study.\n1.5.1   \nIdentified Risk of MLN0002 Treatment:  Infusion-Related Reaction\nAs of 16 April 2010, no anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed \nfollowing initial dosing of MLN0002.  There is an identified risk of infusion-related reaction \nwith vedolizumab, largely limited to individuals who develop clinically significant titers of \nHAHA.  Three (\uf03c1%) of more than 300 subjects known to have received 2 or more \ninfusions of MLN0002 developed an infusion-related reaction, 1 of which was reported as \nserious.  Following a second administration of the MLN0002 formulation used during earlier\ndevelopment, 2 patients experienced signs and symptoms consistent with an acute \ninfusion-related reaction either during or within minutes of administration.  These symptoms \nincluded rash, facial numbness, urticaria, pruritus, puffiness and pressure to the eye, \nangioedema of the lip, and throat tightness.  The third patient, who developed an acute \ninfusion-related reaction after receiving a recent version of MLN0002, had been sensitized \nby exposure to an earlier version of MLN0002 in a previous study.  All of these \ninfusion-related reactions were mild to moderate in intensity and were managed medically \nwith either antihistamines alone or with the addition of steroids.  Please refer to the current \nIB for further information.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n32\nImmunogenicity\nBased on existing data from clinical studies with MLN0002, there is the possibility of \ndeveloping HAHA to vedolizumab that may cause infusion-related reactions, other \nnonspecific AEs, and/or reduced efficacy.  The data from clinical studies with MLN0002 \ndemonstrate dose dependence in clinically relevant HAHA formation (HAHA associated \nwith PK and/or pharmacodynamic changes).  Thus, the immunogenicity of vedolizumab \nmay be substantially reduced at higher doses of MLN0002.\nMore data are required to fully characterize the immunogenicity profile of vedolizumab and \nthe relationship between HAHA levels, efficacy, and AEs, including infusion-related \nreactions.  \n1.5.2   \nPotential Risk of MLN0002 Treatment:  Increased Rates of Infections\nAs observed in the phase 1 and 2 studies, patients with IBD receiving MLN0002 may have \nan increased rate of upper respiratory and mucosal infections.  Upper respiratory infections, \nHerpes labialis, and mucosal candidiasis were more common in subjects who received \nMLN0002 in the phase 1 and 2 studies.  Given the known distribution of the MAdCAM-1 \nbinding sites in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tissue and vagina, it is possible that \nupper respiratory tract, esophageal, and vaginal infections may be more common based on \nthe mechanism of action of MLN0002.\n1.5.3   \nHypothetical Risks of MLN0002 Treatment (Not Observed to Date)\nGastrointestinal Infections\nThere is a hypothetical risk that MLN0002 may increase GI infections, as well as systemic \ninfections against which the gut constitutes a defensive barrier.  Examples of such infections \ninclude those caused by enteric pathogens (eg, Listeria, Salmonella, Campylobacter, \nYersinia, C. difficile), viral infections such as CMV, and opportunistic infections (eg, \ncryptosporidiosis, Mycobacterium avium complex).\nAs of 16 April 2010, however, increased rates of GI infections or severe infections have not \nbeen observed among healthy subjects or patients administered MLN0002.  No systemic \nopportunistic infections with a portal of entry outside the GI tract have been reported.  In the \nsubset of patients who received concomitant steroids and immunosuppressants while \nMLN0002 serum levels were still detectable, no increased rate of infections was seen.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n33\nProgressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\nThe cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) reported in patients being \ntreated with the pan-\uf0614 integrin antagonist natalizumab (Tysabri\u00ae) have focused safety \nconcerns on integrin antagonists.  The gut-selective anti-inflammatory activity of MLN0002, \nas a specific \uf0614\uf0627 integrin antagonist, may not predispose patients to an increased risk of \nPML.  Nevertheless, all ongoing MLN0002 clinical studies use the Risk Assessment and \nMinimization for PML (RAMP) program as a Risk Minimization Action Plan for PML.  \nDetails of the RAMP program are provided in Section 10.5.3 and in the Study Manual.  \nMalignancy\nThe incidence of certain malignancies, in particular lymphoma and colorectal cancer, may, \nin theory, increase in patients on long-term immunosuppressive therapies, particularly those \nwhich target cell-mediated immunity.\nAs of 16 April 2010, the percentages of MLN0002 and placebo subjects who have \ndeveloped a malignancy during the long-term study follow-up are similar.  There have been \n4 cases of malignancies reported posttreatment in the completed studies:  2 cases of breast \ncancer, 1 case of cervical cancer, and 1 case of endometrial cancer, the latter of which was \npresent before study entry.  No cases of lymphoma or neoplasia of another organ system \nwere reported during the long-term follow-up periods (through 2 years from last dose of \nstudy drug) in any of the clinical studies for which these data are available.\nA number of malignancies have occurred over the duration of the phase 3 program, which \nremains blinded at the time of the writing of this amendment. At the meeting in December \n2011, the DSMB for the phase 3 program reviewed unblinded data, and no modifications to \nthe trial were requested. \n1.5.4   \nSummary of Risks and Benefits\nThe safety analysis of all completed trials, as well as the current safety experience from the \nongoing phase 3 trials, demonstrate that MLN0002 has an acceptable safety profile.  Phase 2 \nstudies have demonstrated efficacy in UC and CD.  These data support a favorable \nbenefit-to-risk profile for MLN0002.  In addition, based on its targeted mechanism of action, \nMLN0002 may prove to have a superior benefit-to-risk profile compared with conventional \nsystemic immunosuppressive therapies for IBD, such as corticosteroids and TNF\uf061\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n34\nantagonists.

Patients will be \nconsented and receive wallet cards prior to or at the Week 0 Visit.  Results of assessments \nfrom the last visit in the previous qualifying study will be used to determine their eligibility \nto participate in this study.  Baseline data will also be obtained from the previous study, \nincluding medical history, disease history, demographics, tobacco use, and prior therapies.  \nIn addition, up to 400 patients without previous treatment with vedolizumab may be enrolled \ndirectly into this study (de novo patients). Patients with UC or CD must meet the \ninclusion/exclusion criteria for de novo patients (Section 5). Baseline data will be obtained \nduring the Screening period.\nEnrollment in this study is defined as the time the patient is entered into the Interactive \nVoice Response System (IVRS) at Week 0.\nFollowing enrollment all patients will be administered 300 mg vedolizumab every 4 weeks \nfor the duration of the study. The total duration of MLN0002 treatment will vary by patient \nbased on continued benefit until July 2017, or until the XAP study is available at the site, or \nuntil patient withdrawal, or until vedolizumab is available to the patient through commercial \nchannels (including reimbursement) for the patient\u2019s clinical scenario, or unless the study is \nterminated early by the sponsor, as described in Section 11.12, whichever is sooner. \nPatients may receive allowed concomitant medications for the treatment of IBD as detailed \nin Section 6.2.1, as determined by the principal investigator, at any time point during the \nstudy. Medications may be discontinued during the study, but if discontinuation is planned, \nit should be done prior to the first dose of vedolizumab. \nIt is strongly recommended that patients receiving oral corticosteroids should begin an oral \ncorticosteroid tapering regimen once they achieve clinical response or if, in the opinion of \nthe investigator, they demonstrate sufficient improvement in clinical signs and symptoms.  \nPatients will be withdrawn from the study for long-term treatment failure as described in the \nstudy definitions or if (in the opinion of the investigator or patient) they are not benefiting \nfrom therapy (see Section 6.2.3, Section 6.4.10, and Section 7.4).  Additionally, \ninvestigators should strongly consider withdrawing patients who require recurrent courses of \ncorticosteroids with inability to taper.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n38\nPatients who do not transition into the XAP study will return 16 weeks after their last dose \nof MLN0002 for the Final Safety visit. Patients who transition into the XAP study are not \nrequired to attend the Final Safety Visit.  The safety of these patients will be monitored as \npart of the XAP study.  The end-of-study eCRF page must be completed for all patients \nregardless of whether they transition into the XAP study or not.\nSafety assessments and efficacy assessments using the partial Mayo Score (for patients with \nUC) or the HBI score (for patients with CD) will be made throughout the treatment period.  \nDetailed visit-by-visit study procedures and assessments are provided in the Schedule of \nEvents and Section 7.\nThis trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice (GCP), \nand the applicable regulatory requirements (including International Conference on \nHarmonisation [ICH] guidelines).\n4.2   Number of Patients\nApproximately 1800 rollover patients with UC or CD will enroll in this study from \napproximately 400 study centers worldwide following participation in other qualifying \nMLN0002 studies.  In addition, up to 400 de novo patients with UC or CD (not previously \ntreated with vedolizumab) will enroll in this study.  These patients will be enrolled from \napproximately 150 of the 400 worldwide centers noted above.  Those sites selected to enroll \nde novo patients will be notified by the sponsor.\n4.3   Duration of Study\nIt is anticipated that the duration of MLN0002 treatment will vary by patient based on \ncontinued benefit. Treatment duration may continue until July 2017, or until the XAP study\nis available at the site, or until patient withdrawal, or until vedolizumab is available to the \npatient through commercial channels (including reimbursement) for the patient\u2019s clinical \nscenario, or unless the study is terminated early by the sponsor, as described in Section \n11.12, whichever is sooner. After the final dose of MLN0002, patients who do not transition \ninto the XAP study will complete the 16-week posttreatment observation and safety \nassessment period (not applicable to patients who transition to the XAP study). Concomitant \nvedolizumab (Entyvio) taken during the 16-week follow-up period will be recorded as a \nconcomitant medication and will not be considered as a protocol deviation. \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n39\nAdditionally, upon completion of or termination from this study, patients will participate in \na 2-year follow-up survey, as described in Section 7.6.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n40\n5.   \nSTUDY POPULATION\n5.1   Inclusion Criteria for Rollover Patients\nEach rollover patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the \nstudy:  \n1.

Cases in which the \ninvestigator believes the patient should stay on study must be discussed with the Medical \nAdvisor or the Takeda Medical Monitor.   \nIt is strongly recommended that patients receiving oral corticosteroids should begin an oral \ncorticosteroid tapering regimen once they either achieve clinical response or if, in the \nopinion of the investigator, they have demonstrated sufficient improvement.\nThe recommended tapering schedule is as follows:\n\uf0b7\nFor prednisone at doses > 10 mg/day (or equivalent), the dose should be \nreduced at a rate of 5 mg per week until a 10 mg/day dose is reached.\n\uf0b7\nFor prednisone at doses \uf0a310 mg/day (or equivalent) or once a 10 mg/day \ndose (or equivalent) is achieved by tapering, the dose should be reduced \nat a rate of 2.5 mg/week until discontinuation.\n\uf0b7\nFor budesonide, the dose should be tapered at a rate of 3 mg every \n3 weeks.\nInvestigators should strongly consider withdrawing patients who require recurrent \ncorticosteroid courses with an inability to taper.  \n6.3   Precautions and Restrictions\nFemale patients participating in MLN0002 clinical studies should avoid becoming pregnant \nand male subjects should avoid impregnating a female partner.  \nFemale patients of childbearing potential must practice 2 effective methods of contraception, \nat the same time, during from the time of signing the informed consent form through 18 \nweeks after the last dose of study drug.  It is strongly recommended that at least 1 of these 2 \nmethods be highly effective (eg, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive \npatches, intrauterine devices).  Female patients are exempt from contraception requirements \nif they are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before enrollment, are surgically sterile (ie, \nstatus post effective tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), or \ncompletely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.\nMale patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), must practice effective \nbarrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and continue contraception for \n18 weeks after their last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual \nintercourse.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n55\n6.4   Management of Clinical Events\n6.4.1   \nAdverse Event Collection Involving Medically Anticipated Clinical Events \n(IBD)\nUC and CD are associated with certain characteristic signs and symptoms including \ndiarrhea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain that may be present at baseline and persist or \nfluctuate based on the individual patient\u2019s disease history during the course of the study.  \nThese signs and symptoms are considered medically anticipated clinical events for the \ncondition under study and will not be collected as adverse events.  These characteristics of \ndisease activity will be regularly captured in either the partial Mayo score or the HBI and \nwill be reviewed by the DSMB.  \nExacerbations of disease activity for UC (eg, increase in the daily amount of rectal bleeding \nbeyond the patient\u2019s normal fluctuation) or CD (eg, increase in the daily amount of \nabdominal pain beyond the patient\u2019s normal fluctuation) will be collected as adverse events \n(AEs) and reported according to regulatory reporting requirements.\nExtra-intestinal manifestations of the patient\u2019s disease (eg, arthralgias, arthritis, uveitis) that \ndevelop or worsen during the study are considered AEs.  \n6.4.2   \nInfusion-Related Reactions\nCurrently, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of \npremedication (eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to patients receiving MLN0002; hence,\nsuch premedications are unlikely to be necessary or beneficial.  At the discretion of the \ninvestigator, however, patients may be administered premedication prior to any study drug \ninfusion.  Corticosteroids, if given as premedication, should be limited to the day of \ninfusion.  \nPatients will be monitored for acute infusion-related reactions during infusion and for at \nleast 1 hour after the completion of each administration of MLN0002.  Epinephrine and \nparenteral diphenhydramine must be readily available for immediate use in case an \ninfusion-related reaction occurs.  Site personnel must be able to detect and treat \ninfusion-related reactions.\nPatients should be instructed to report the development of rash, hives, pruritus, flushing, \nurticaria, etc. that may represent an infusion-related reaction to MLN0002.  If any signs or \nsymptoms of infusion-related reactions are observed during the infusion, administration of \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n56\nMLN0002 must be immediately discontinued and the patient treated as medically \nappropriate.  In the case of a mild reaction, MLN0002 infusion may be reinitiated (with \nappropriate premedication) at the discretion of the investigator.  Patients with a severe or \nserious infusion-related reaction (eg, stridor, angioedema, life-threatening change in vital \nsigns) must be withdrawn from the study.\nIn all cases of infusion-related reactions, the medical monitor must be informed as soon as is \npractical (see the Study Manual for contact information).  The disposition of patients with \nless severe infusion-related reactions should be discussed with the medical monitor.  All \ncases of infusion-related reactions that do not meet SAE definitions as specified in \nSection 10.1.2 will be collected as AEs.  The intensity, relationship to study medication, \naction taken and outcome for all cases of infusion-related reactions, regardless of \nseriousness, will be recorded on the AE eCRF.\n6.4.3   \nLeukopenia or Lymphopenia\nTotal WBC and lymphocyte counts will be regularly monitored for all patients.  \nAzathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate, if applicable, must be discontinued and \nthe dose of MLN0002 held for an absolute lymphocyte count < 0.5 \uf0b4109/L at any point \nduring the study. The absolute lymphocyte count must be repeated at appropriate intervals \nas determined by the investigator. The next dose of MLN0002 can be administered only\nif the absolute lymphocyte count is \u22650.5 \uf0b4109/L. If the absolute lymphocyte count remains \n< 0.5 \uf0b4109/L for greater than 9 weeks, permission for the patient to continue on study must \nbe obtained from the Takeda Medical Monitor.\n6.4.4   \nInfection\nPatients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and for lymphopenia during \nthe study.  Patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of infection, including GI \ninfections, will be treated as clinically indicated; interventions may include antibiotic \ntreatment, if appropriate, and/or discontinuation of concomitant immunomodulatory \nmedications.  Blood, sputum, urine, and/or stool cultures will be obtained as appropriate for \ndetection and diagnosis of infection.  Withholding or terminating MLN0002 administration \nmay be considered as described in Section 7.4.  Failure to respond to standard therapies for \ninfection will be recorded as part of AE collection.  \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n57\n6.4.5   \nMalignancy\nAll cases of malignancies that are detected during the study will be reported as AEs or SAEs \nas defined in Section 10.1.  Local medical practices will apply.  Monitoring for colorectal \nmucosal dysplasia and cancer will be performed during the study as described in \nSection 6.2.\n6.4.6   \nHepatoxicity\nPatients will be monitored throughout the study for evidence of hepatotoxicity with regular \nliver function tests and routine clinical assessments.\n6.4.7   \nManagement of Positive Subjective PML Checklist\nAll patients will be screened for new neurological signs and symptoms potentially consistent \nwith PML at frequent and regular intervals and ad hoc as appropriate using the PML \nsubjective symptom checklist.  De novo patients with a positive subjective PML checklist at \nscreening will not be enrolled.  Any patient with a positive subjective PML checklist at any \ntime after enrollment will be evaluated according to the PML case evaluation algorithm as \ndescribed in the Study Manual.  The next dose of MLN0002 will be held until the evaluation \nis completed and results are available.  Subsequent doses of MLN0002 will be administered \nonly if the possibility of PML is definitively excluded, as described in the RAMP program \n(see Section 10.5).\n6.4.8   \nUnscheduled Visits Due to Disease Exacerbation\nPatients who are experiencing symptoms of possible disease exacerbation need not wait \nuntil their next scheduled visit to be seen; they should be evaluated as deemed appropriate \nby the treating physician. Patients who are seen by the investigator or site staff at a time \npoint not required by the protocol (ie, an unscheduled visit) due to disease exacerbation \nshould undergo the following:  \n\uf0b7\nSymptom-directed physical examination\n\uf0b7\nVital signs assessment\n\uf0b7\nPatient assessment of disease activity\n\uf0b7\nRecording of concomitant medications and procedures\n\uf0b7\nCollection of AEs and SAEs\n\uf0b7\nClinical chemistry and hematology as indicated\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n58\n!\nStool sample, if indicated, may be obtained for culture, ova and parasite\nevaluation, and C. difficile assay\n!\nPartial Mayo score or HBI score\n!\nHAHA sample collection\nThere is no minimum time for repeat evaluation by unscheduled visit. \n6.4.9   \nNeed for Rescue Medications\nAdministration of a new medication to treat a new or unresolved luminal manifestation of \nUC or CD, with the exclusion of 5-ASA agents (oral and topical/rectal), oral corticosteroids \nas outlined in Section 6.2.3, topical (rectal) corticosteroids, azathioprine/\n6-mercaptopurine/methotrexate (methotrexate for CD only), antibiotics, antidiarrheals for \ncontrol of chronic diarrhea, and probiotics, is considered a rescue medication, and \nconstitutes long-term treatment failure (Section 6.4.10).  \nMedications should not be withheld if, in the opinion of the investigator, failure to prescribe \nthem could compromise patient safety.  Based on the clinical pharmacology of MLN0002 \nand the potential for additive toxicities with other immunosuppressive drugs, serious \nconsideration should be given to the administration (as rescue medications) of biologic \nagents or other therapies with a prolonged pharmacodynamic effect.\n6.4.10   \nLong-term Treatment Failure\nAs defined in the Study Definitions, there are 3 types of long-term treatment failure:  \n(1) patients who require rescue medications (see Section 6.4.9); (2) patients who require \nmajor surgical intervention for the treatment of IBD; and (3) patients who have a study \ndrug-related AE leading to discontinuation from the study.  Patients who meet the definition \nof long-term treatment failure must be withdrawn from the study (Section 7.4).  \n6.5   Blinding and Unblinding\nThis is an open-label study, there is no blinding.  \n6.6   Description of Investigational Agents\nMLN0002 drug product is a lyophilized solid formulation at 60 mg/mL in a solution \ncontaining \n histidine, \n arginine, \n sucrose,\n polysorbate 80, \nCCI\nCCI\nCCI\nCCI\nCCI\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n59\nEach vial will be reconstituted with sterile water for injection according to the instructions in \nthe Pharmacy Manual.\n6.7   Preparation, Reconstitution, and Dispensation\nThe investigational pharmacist will prepare the study treatment under standard aseptic \nconditions.

The questionnaire will collect data on \nevents such as pregnancy and infections resulting in hospitalization (6-month telephone call \nonly), colorectal dysplasia or cancer, IBD-related surgeries, and the development of PML.  \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n69\n8.   \nSTATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES\n8.1   Determination of Sample Size\nThis is a phase 3 study to determine the long-term safety of MLN0002 in patients with UC \nand CD.  Most patients enrolled in this study will have participated in a previous qualifying \nMLN0002 study as detailed in Section 4.1 (rollover patients).  Up to 400 additional patients \nwho have not been previously treated with MLN0002 may be enrolled (de novo patients) to \nsupplement the safety database. The current estimate is that approximately 2200 patients \ntotal will enter this study.\n8.2   Randomization and Stratification\nNo randomization or stratification is planned for this study.\n8.3   Populations for Analysis\nThere are 2 patient populations in this study for data analyses:  the efficacy population and \nthe safety population.  \nEfficacy Population\nThe efficacy population consists of all enrolled patients.  However, to be included in an \nanalysis at any specific time point, the patient must have had a postbaseline measurement for \nthe time point.  Additionally, to be included in a change from baseline analysis, the patient \nmust have had a baseline measurement.\nThis population will be used for all exploratory efficacy analyses.  \nSafety Population\nThe safety population for this study is defined as all patients who receive any amount of \nMLN0002 in this study.  The study safety population will be used for all safety analyses.  \n8.4   Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data\nAll available safety and efficacy data will be included in data listings and tabulations.  No \nimputation of values for missing data will be performed.  Data that are potentially spurious \nor erroneous will be examined under the auspices of standard data management operating \nprocedures.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n70\n8.5   General Methodology\nSummary tabulations will be presented and will display the number of observations, mean, \nstandard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and the \nnumber and percent per category for categorical data.  Statistical analyses will be primarily \ndescriptive in nature.  No formal statistical tests will be performed.\nA formal statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized prior to the completion of \nthe study.  This plan will define the populations for analysis, outline the data handling \nconventions, and specify the statistical methods to be used for safety and exploratory \nefficacy analyses.\n8.6   Baseline Comparisons\nDemographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using frequency distributions \nand summary statistics.  \n8.7   Safety Analyses\nSafety evaluations will be based on incidence, severity and type of AEs, PML checklist \nresponses, vital signs, laboratory results and ECGs.  Descriptive statistics will be calculated.  \nIn addition to overall safety summary, subgroup analyses will be performed:  1) by UC \npatient population and CD patient population; and 2) by concomitant medication.  \nTreatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be tabulated by primary system organ class (SOC), \nhigh level term (HLT), and preferred term.  The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory \nActivities (MedDRA) will be used for coding AEs.  To summarize the number of patients \nwith AEs, patients reporting the same event more than once will have that event counted \nonly once within each SOC, HLT, and preferred term.  Events that are considered related to \ntreatment will also be tabulated.  AEs will also be summarized by intensity.  Death, patients \nwith SAEs, and events resulting in study discontinuation, if present, will be presented in \nseparate data listings.\nThe distribution of HAHA across time will be summarized.  Whether HAHA is neutralizing \nmay be determined.  Furthermore, the results from HAHA and neutralizing HAHA may be \nused to evaluate the relationships among HAHA and efficacy and safety.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n71\nComprehensive Safety Assessment \nSafety data from this study will be reviewed using data including, but not limited to, the \nfollowing:\na.\nData from both the active and the placebo arms of C13006, C13007 and C13011.\nb. Data from the 2-year follow-up survey after the final dose of study drug in C13006, \nC13007, and C13011 (for patients who did not enroll in this Long-term Safety \nStudy).\nc.\nData from an external administrative database, which includes a broad representation \nof patients on various therapies for IBD (including biological agents).  This database \nwill provide an understanding of the background rates of selected events, such as \nIBD-related surgeries and hospitalizations that may occur with current therapies for \nIBD.  Additionally, to allow comparison to Study C13008, a sub population of \npatients who have characteristics similar to those in Study C13008 will be selected \nfrom this database.  This will allow for some comparison to similar patients who may \nbe on conventional treatment for IBD, including treatment with biological agents.  \nPatients who previously participated in the phase 2, open-label, long-term safety study \n(Study C13004) will not be part of the integrated safety analysis for C13008.  Data from all \npatients who previously participated in Study C13004 will be analyzed separately.\nDetails for the condition and methods of comparison will be discussed in the statistical \nanalysis plan.  \n8.8   Resource Utilization and Patient Reported Outcomes\nChanges in health-related quality of life over time will be assessed using IBDQ, SF-36 and \nEQ-5D scores.  Change from baseline in IBDQ, SF-36 and in EQ-5D will be calculated and \n95% confidence intervals will be provided.  For these quality of life assessments, the \nbaseline value will be the last measurement from the previous study as applicable (ie, Study \nC13004, Study C13006, Study C13007, or Study C13011) or the measurement obtained \nduring the Screening period for de novo patients.  The proportion of patients who fall into \ndifferent categories in IBDQ, SF-36, and EQ-5D scores will be summarized and 95% \nconfidence intervals will be provided.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n72\nTime to major IBD-related events (hospitalizations, surgeries and procedures) will be \nanalyzed and 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  \n8.9   Exploratory (Efficacy) Analyses\nThis long-term safety study is not sized based on power considerations.  Thus, no formal \nstatistical hypothesis testing is to be performed.  Furthermore, the lack of a true control arm \nfor comparison purposes limits the use of any formal statistical comparisons that may be \nmade.  Therefore, the primary statistical focus for the efficacy analyses will be on \ndescriptive tabulation of efficacy endpoints rather than on formal analysis of the clinical \ndata.  Descriptive statistics, including 95% confidence intervals, will be provided for all \nclinical efficacy variables of interest.  \nDescriptive statistics will be used in analyses of partial Mayo score (patients with UC) or \nHBI score (patients with CD), IBDQ score, and SF-36 score.  \nThe change from baseline in CRP level, partial Mayo score or HBI score, and IBDQ score \nwill be summarized by time point, and the means will be plotted over time.  The percentage\nof patients with a clinical response and with clinical remission will be tabulated at each time \npoint.  For patients who were not in clinical response or clinical remission at the beginning \nof the study, the percentage of patients who demonstrate an initial clinical response and go \non to maintain a sustained clinical response or clinical remission will be tabulated at each \ntime point.  \nFor definitions of clinical response and clinical remission, refer to the study definitions\nStudy Definitions.  Further details on the statistical analyses, including exploratory \nevaluations, any sensitivity analyses and data handling details regarding issues such as \nmissing data, will be discussed in the statistical analysis plan.  \n8.10   \nInterim Analysis\nInterim analyses and reports will be done periodically during the conduct of the study to \nsupport regulatory filings and updates.  \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n73\n9.   \nSTUDY COMMITTEES\n9.1   Data Safety Monitoring Board\nA data safety monitoring board (DSMB), independent from the sponsor, will be established \nto review safety data from this study including, but not limited to, AEs of special interest \n(eg, infusion-related reactions, infections) on a regular basis and to make appropriate \nrecommendations.  With agreement of the DSMB and Takeda, the schedule may be \nmodified based on the rate of patient accrual and findings from reviews.  A detailed charter \noutlines all activities of the DSMB (eg, type of data reviewed, frequency of meetings, \nlocation of meetings).  \nThe safety analyses will be generated for the DSMB by an independent statistician.  \nNew neurological signs and symptoms potentially consistent with PML will be reviewed \nand adjudicated by the IAC per the RAMP algorithm (see Section 9.2).\n9.2   Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Independent Adjudication \nCommittee\nTakeda\u2019s RAMP program includes an independent adjudication committee (IAC) consisting \nof a panel of leading PML experts, including a neurologist, a neuroradiologist, and a \nvirologist.  The RAMP PML evaluation algorithm describes the involvement of the IAC.  \nDescriptions of the RAMP program and the IAC are in the Study Manual.  The processes for \nIAC case review are defined in the IAC Charter.  IAC proceedings and recommendations\nwill be promptly communicated to the DSMB.  \n9.3   Publications Committee\nA publications committee will be convened, details of which will be provided in a \npublications committee charter.  Additional details on the use of information are provided in \nSection 12.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n74\n10.   \nADVERSE EVENTS\n10.1   \nDefinitions\n10.1.1   \nAdverse Event Definition\nAn adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a \npharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the \ntreatment.  An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal \nlaboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study \ndrug, whether or not it is considered to be study drug related.  This includes any newly \noccurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the \nadministration of study drug.\nRefer to Section 6.4.1 for additional details regarding clinical events related to IBD.\n10.1.2   \nSerious Adverse Event Definition\nA serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality \nthat:\n\uf0b7\nResults in death\n\uf0b7\nIs life-threatening.  Life-threatening means that the patient was at \nimmediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, ie, it does not \ninclude a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it \noccurred in a more severe form.\n\uf0b7\nRequires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing \nhospitalization (see Section 10.2)\n\uf0b7\nResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Disability is \ndefined as a substantial disruption of a person\u2019s ability to conduct normal \nlife functions.\n\uf0b7\nIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n75\n\uf0b7\nIs an important medical event.  An important medical event is an event \nthat may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization \nbut may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical \njudgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or \nsurgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the \ndefinitions for SAEs or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal \nproduct of an infectious agent.  Examples of such medical events include \nallergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency \nroom or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in \ninpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug \nabuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein \ntransmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or \nnonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.\n\uf0b7\nAdditionally, in this study, any diagnosis of PML will be considered an \nSAE.\nClarification should be made between the terms \u201cserious\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d because they ARE \nNOT synonymous.  The term \u201csevere\u201d is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a \nspecific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, \nhowever, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  This \nis NOT the same as \u201cserious,\u201d which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria \ndescribed above and are usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient\u2019s life or \nfunctioning.  A severe adverse event does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For \nexample, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but \nnot an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disability may \nbe considered mild, but would be defined as an SAE based on the above noted criteria.  \nSeriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.\n10.2   \nProcedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious \nAdverse Events \nAll AEs spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an open question from \nstudy personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other diagnostic \nprocedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  Any clinically relevant \ndeterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an adverse \nevent and must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF.  When possible, signs and \nsymptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as 1 comprehensive \nevent.\nAll SAEs that occur during the course of the study, as defined in Section 10.1, must be \nreported by the investigator Takeda Pharmacovigilance, (contact information provided \nbelow) by faxing the SAE Form within 1 working day after becoming aware of the event.  \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n76\nAll SAEs and deaths must be reported whether or not considered causally related to the \nstudy drug.  The SAE Form, created specifically by Takeda, will be provided to each clinical \nstudy site.  A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study Manual.  Follow-up \ninformation on the SAE may be requested by Takeda.  SAE report information must match \nthe data provided on the eCRF.  \nSAE Reporting Contact Information\nTakeda Pharmacovigilance \nFax:  +1 224-554-1052 (North and South America)\nEmail: TakedaEntyvioCases@cognizant.com (All countries)\nPlanned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease which existed \nbefore the patient was enrolled in the trial or before study drug was given are not to be \nconsidered AEs unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial.\nHospital admissions related to a protocol-required procedure (eg, admissions for \npatient/clinic convenience prior to or following colonoscopy or infusion) will not be \nconsidered AEs.\nAdditionally, any diagnoses of PML will be reported as SAEs.\nFor both SAEs and AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and \nthe relationship of the event to MLN0002 administration.\nIntensity for each AE, including any laboratory abnormality, will be defined according to the \nfollowing criteria:\nMild\nAwareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated\nModerate Discomfort enough to cause interference with normal daily activities\nSevere\nInability to perform normal daily activities\nRelationship to MLN0002 administration will be determined by the investigator responding \nyes or no to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE was associated with \nthe study drug?\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n77\n10.3   \nMonitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation\nAll AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time of enrollment (for de novo patients, SAE \ncollection will begin after the signing of informed consent) up to 16 weeks (112 days) after \nthe last on-study dose of MLN0002 (as applicable).  For patients enrolling into the XAP \nstudy, AEs and SAEs will be collected until the patient is consented into the XAP study (this \nis expected to occur at the final C13008 dosing visit where possible).  All SAEs should be \nmonitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient\u2019s stable or \nchronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).\nAny SAE that occurs at any time after completion of the study period that the investigator \nconsiders to be related to study drug must be reported to Takeda Pharmacovigilance.\n10.4   \nProcedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events\nIf a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while participating in this study, \nor within 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug, she must inform the investigator \nimmediately and permanently discontinue study drug.  The sponsor must also be contacted \nimmediately by faxing a completed Pregnancy Form to Takeda Pharmacovigilance (see \nSection 10.2).  The pregnancy must be followed through for the final pregnancy outcome.\nIf a female partner of a male study participant becomes pregnant during the male patient\u2019s \nparticipation in this study, or within 18 weeks after the last dose of study drug, the sponsor \nmust also be contacted immediately by faxing a completed Pregnancy Form to Takeda \nPharmacovigilance.  Every effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final \npregnancy outcome.\n10.5   \nRisk Management\nRisk minimization, management, and assessment procedures have been implemented in the \nstudy to minimize and assess potential risks to patients who participate in clinical studies of \nMLN0002.  Components include:  (1) specific study entry and exclusion criteria to ensure \nthat patients who have underlying characteristics that potentially increase their risk for an \nadverse outcome are excluded; (2) protocol-specific procedures for minimizing and \nmanaging certain AEs, such as infusion-related reactions and infections; (3) overview \nsurveillance by 2 independent safety committees (DSMB and IAC; see Section 9.1 and \nSection 9.2, respectively); (4) a dedicated Risk Minimization Action Plan for PML (the \nRAMP, see Section 10.5.3) that educates staff and patients on PML and includes an \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n78\nalgorithm for early detection and evaluation of signs and symptoms suggestive of PML; and \n(5) long-term, poststudy follow-up (2 years) safety assessment.  Specific components are \ndescribed below, in Section 6.4 and Section 7.6, and in the Study Manual.\n10.5.1   \nSpecific Risk Assessment and Minimization Procedures for Identified Risk \nAssociated With MLN0002 Treatment:  Infusion-Related Reaction\nSite personnel will be trained in rapid detection and standard treatment of infusion-related \nreactions.  Management of infusion-related reactions is detailed in Section 6.4.2.  \nImmunogenicity\nBased on existing data from clinical studies with vedolizumab, there is the possibility of \ndeveloping HAHA to vedolizumab that may cause infusion-related reactions, other \nnonspecific AEs, and/or reduced efficacy.  Patients will be monitored for AEs and treated as \nclinically appropriate.\n10.5.2   \nSpecific Risk Assessment and Minimization Procedures for Potential Risk of \nMLN0002 Treatment: Increased Rates of Infections\nPatients who have an increased risk of infection (eg, serious comorbidity, immune system \ndysfunction) will be excluded from the study.  Patients on study will be monitored for signs \nand symptoms of infection and for lymphopenia.  Patients with signs and symptoms \nsuggestive of infection will be treated as clinically indicated; interventions may include \nantibiotic treatment, if appropriate, and/or discontinuation of concomitant \nimmunomodulatory medications.  Blood, sputum, urine, and/or stool cultures will be \nobtained as appropriate for detection and diagnosis of infection.  Withholding or terminating \nstudy drug administration may be considered, as appropriate.  Management of infection is \ndescribed in Section 6.4.4.\n10.5.3   \nSpecific Risk Assessment and Minimization Procedures for Hypothetical \nRisks of MLN0002 Treatment (Not Observed to Date)\nGastrointestinal Infections\nThe hypothetical risk that MLN0002 may increase GI infections will be addressed as \ndetailed above (Section 10.5.2) for the potential risk of increased rates of infections.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n79\nProgressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\nThe cases of PML reported in patients being treated with the pan-\uf0614 integrin antagonist \nnatalizumab (Tysabri\u00ae) have focused safety concerns on integrin antagonists.  The \nimmunomodulatory mechanism of vedolizumab, as a selective \uf0614\uf0627 integrin antagonist, may \nnot predispose patients to an increased risk of PML.  Nevertheless, all ongoing vedolizumab \nclinical studies will use the RAMP program as a Risk Minimization Action Plan for PML.  \nThe RAMP program minimizes the risk of PML by focusing on early clinical detection and \nmanagement of PML, including discontinuation of study drug, if applicable.  An \nindependent adjudication committee (IAC) has been established as part of the RAMP \nprogram to review possible cases of PML and will provide input regarding patient \nevaluation and management as defined in the IAC charter.  Additional details of the RAMP \nprogram are in the Study Manual.  Plasmapheresis and mefloquine have been reported as \npotentially efficacious treatments for natalizumab-associated PML.(25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30)\nPatients are assessed for signs and symptoms of PML before the administration of each dose \nof study drug using a PML subjective symptom checklist.  Patients with a positive PML \nsubjective symptom checklist at any time after enrollment in an MLN0002 clinical study \nwill be evaluated according to a prespecified algorithm (the PML Case Evaluation \nAlgorithm, provided in the Study Manual).  The next dose of study drug will be held until \nthe evaluation is complete and results are available.  Subsequent doses of study drug will be \nadministered only if the possibility of PML is definitively excluded, as described in the \nRAMP algorithm. The IAC will review new neurological signs and symptoms potentially \nconsistent with PML and will provide input regarding patient evaluation and management as \ndefined in the IAC charter.  \nTo ensure the success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the \nfeatures of PML, and patients will be trained to report specific neurological signs and \nsymptoms without delay.  Educational materials for teaching site personnel and patients \nabout PML and the RAMP procedures will be distributed to all sites.  Formal teaching and \ntraining will be performed for site personnel before the start of the study.  Patients will \nreceive training and educational materials before enrollment.  The ICF will contain specific\ninformation on the hypothetical risk of PML.\nThe PML IAC will be informed of all new neurological signs and symptoms potentially \nconsistent with PML per the PML Case Evaluation Algorithm and will review the individual \npatient data.  The algorithm and tools are included in the Study Manual.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n80\nAll documented cases of PML will be reported as SAEs, regardless of whether \nhospitalization occurs.\nMalignancy\nPatients with a history of malignancy (except for specific cancers) or at increased risk for \nmalignancy (eg, patients with identified established immunodeficiencies or colonic mucosal \ndysplasia) will be excluded from this study (see Section 5.2).  It is expected that patients \nenrolled in the study will be up-to-date on colorectal cancer screening. \n10.5.4   \nRisk Assessment\nFor patients who do not enroll in Study C13008, the risk assessment part of this study will \ninclude a 2-year follow-up survey after the last dose of study drug, as described in \nSection 7.6, to determine if any patients have been diagnosed with PML or malignancy, or \nhave had bowel surgeries.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n81\n11.   \nADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS\n11.1   \nGood Clinical Practice\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH Guideline for GCP and the \nappropriate regulatory requirement(s).  The investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the \nappropriate use of MLN0002 as described in the protocol and the IB.\n11.2   \nData Quality Assurance\nThe investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories \ndesigned to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study \npatient.  Study data will be entered into an eCRF by site personnel using a secure, validated \nweb-based electronic data capture (EDC) application.  Takeda will have access to all data \nupon entry in the EDC application.\nStudy monitors will discuss instances of missing or uninterpretable data with the \ninvestigator for resolution.  Any changes to study data will be made to the eCRF and \ndocumented via an electronic audit trail associated with the affected eCRF.\n11.3   \nElectronic Case Report Form Completion \nTakeda or designee will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the \nEDC application, sufficient to permit site personnel to enter or correct information in the \neCRFs for the patients for which they are responsible.\neCRFs will be completed for each study patient.  It is the investigator\u2019s responsibility to \nensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the \npatient\u2019s eCRF.\nThe investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as \npossible after information is collected.\nThe audit trail entry will show the user\u2019s identification information, and the date and time of \nthe correction.  The investigator must provide through the EDC application formal approval \nof all the information in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endorse the final submitted \ndata for the patients for which he or she is responsible.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n82\nTakeda, or a designee, will retain the eCRF data and corresponding audit trails.  A copy of \nthe final archival eCRF in the form of a compact disk or other electronic media will be \nplaced in the investigator\u2019s study file.\n11.4   \nStudy Monitoring\nMonitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Takeda will be followed, in \norder to comply with GCP guidelines.\nAll information recorded on the eCRFs for this study must be consistent with the patient\u2019s \nsource documentation.  During the course of the study, the study monitor will make study \nsite visits to review protocol compliance, verify eCRFs against source documentation, assess \ndrug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent \nregulatory requirements.  The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to \nensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.\n11.5   \nEthical Considerations\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration \nof Helsinki.  The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study documentation in order to \nsafeguard the rights, safety and well-being of the patients.  The study will only be conducted \nat sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained.  The protocol, IB, informed consent \nform, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the patients (including \ndiary cards and wallet cards, if applicable), safety updates, annual progress reports, and any \nrevisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC by the investigator or the \nsponsor, as allowable by local regulations.\n11.6   \nPatient Information and Informed Consent\nAfter the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from \neither the patient or his/her guardian or legal representative prior to study participation.  The \nmethod of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent \nis to comply with ICH-GCP and all applicable regulatory requirement(s).\n11.7   \nPatient Confidentiality\nIn order to maintain patient privacy, all eCRFs, MLN0002 accountability records, study \nreports and communications will identify the patient by initials where permitted and/or by \nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n83\nthe assigned patient number.  The patient\u2019s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be \nmade publicly available to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations.\n11.8   \nInvestigator Compliance\nThe investigator will conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol provided by Takeda, \nand given approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC and the appropriate regulatory \nauthority(ies).  Modifications to the protocol are not to be made without agreement of both \nthe investigator and Takeda.  Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC \napproval/favorable opinion prior to implementation, except when the modification is needed \nto eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients.  Takeda, or a designee, will submit all \nprotocol modifications to the appropriate regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the \ngoverning regulations.\nWhen immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate \nhazard(s) to patients, the investigator will contact Takeda, or a designee, if circumstances \npermit, to discuss the planned course of action.  Any departures from the protocol must be \ndocumented.\n11.9   \nOn-site Audits\nRegulatory authorities, the IEC/IRB, and/or Takeda may request access to all source \ndocuments, eCRFs, and other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection.

The decision of whether or not to \nassess any HAHA-positive samples for neutralizing HAHA will be determined as HAHA \nand pharmacodynamic data from all ongoing MLN0002 studies are reviewed.  A \nneutralizing HAHA assay will be performed only if the results will contribute to a better \nunderstanding of the immunogenicity of MLN0002.  \nOther changes are corrections of primarily typographical, grammatical, contextual and \npunctuation errors.\nPurposes for Amendment 1\nThe purposes of this amendment are to:\n\uf0b7\nCross-reference the USAN-approved generic name, vedolizumab, which is \nsynonymous with the MLN0002 drug product being investigated in this study\n\uf0b7\nClarify that neutralizing HAHA assessment may be performed if necessary to better \nunderstand the immunogenicity of MLN0002\n\uf0b7\nClarify that recommendations regarding pregnancy begin at the time of signing the  \ninformed consent form\n\uf0b7\nClarify that the RAMP (Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML) is a RiskMAP\n\uf0b7\nClarify in Section 7.3.23 that hematology is not being performed at Week 0 \n\uf0b7\nClarify in Section 7.6 that all patients will participate in a 2 year follow-up survey\n\uf0b7\nCorrect the value for absolute lymphocyte count in Section 6.4.3\n\uf0b7\nClarify that concomitant procedures will be recorded starting at time of enrollment \n(concomitant procedures from a previous study will not be recorded in the eCRFs for \nStudy C13008)\n\uf0b7\nExpand the definition of serious adverse event (SAE) to include any event that involves \nsuspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product \n\uf0b7\nCorrect typographical, grammatical, contextual, and punctuation errors\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n94\n15.4   \nPurposes and Rationale for Amendment 2\nRationale for Amendment 2\nRevisions and corrections have been made to clarify the initial intent of this protocol as \nlisted below in the purposes.  Also, the window for patients to enroll in this study after the \nlast dose of MLN0002 in Study C13004 has been extended from 5 to 9 weeks.  This window \nis consistent with the dosing intervals in Study C13004 and is not expected to affect the \npatients\u2019 clinical progress or the planned statistical analyses.  The enrollment window for \npatients entering this study after Study C13006 or Study C13007 is unchanged.\nPurposes for Amendment 2\nThe purposes of this amendment are to:\n\uf0b7\nRevise the definition of rescue medications with all applicable exceptions.\n\uf0b7\nClarify that data for pre-enrollment quality of life assessments will be obtained from the \nprevious study as applicable.\n\uf0b7\nClarify that patients who withdrew from Study C13006 or Study C13007 only as a result \nof receiving rescue medications before Week 14 are not eligible for Study C13008.\n\uf0b7\nExtend the window for patients to enroll in this study after the last dose of MLN0002 in \nStudy C13004 from 5 to 9 weeks.\n\uf0b7\nRevise inclusion criteria by removing the requirement of \"stable dose\" for patients on \ncorticosteroids at the time of enrollment.  \n\uf0b7\nClarify the length of required observation at the clinical site based on the completion of \ndosing.\n\uf0b7\nRevise the advice regarding prophylactic administration of premedication for better \nclarity.\n\uf0b7\nAdd language to Section 6.4.8 to clarify the timing of an unscheduled visit as it relates to\nthe criteria for defining disease worsening.\n\uf0b7\nRemove language in Section 7.3.22 regarding the transfer of AE and SAE information \nfrom the previous study to the C13008 eCRFs.  \n\uf0b7\nClarify that data from patients who previously participated in Study C13004 will not be \npart of the integrated safety analysis, but will be analyzed separately.\n\uf0b7\nCorrect an incorrect crossreference in Section 10.5.3 and remove an unnecessary \nstatement regarding the reporting of malignancies.  Reporting of malignancies is covered \nin Section 6.4.5 and governed by the definitions and reporting requirements of adverse \nevents (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as detailed in Section 10.\n\uf0b7\nRemove statements in the rationale for Amendment 1 (see Section 15.3) regarding \npharmacodynamic sampling and objectives.  These statements were incorrect because \nthere were no pharmacodynamic objectives or pharmacodynamic samples to be \ncollected in this study at any time.\n\uf0b7\nCorrect typographical, grammatical, contextual, and punctuation errors, as necessary.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n95\n15.5   \nPurposes and Rationale for Amendment 3 (for use only outside of the US)\nRationale for Amendment 3\nRecently published data suggest incremental efficacy, acceptable safety, and the potential \nfor decreased long-term immunogenicity with concomitant immunomodulator therapy; \ntherefore, it may be beneficial for patients enrolled in this study to receive concomitant \nimmunomodulators.  If deemed appropriate by the investigator, patients will now be allowed \nto continue azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate if they were receiving these \nmedications during prior participation in Study C13006 or Study C13007.  \nThis amendment also allows patients who are unable to complete the corticosteroid taper \nwithin the first 6 months of the study to continue in the study, provided they do not exceed a \ndaily oral corticosteroid dose of the equivalent of 5 mg/day of prednisone or 3 mg/day of \nbudesonide.  After 6 months, given the long duration of this study, a one-time oral \ncorticosteroid course of up to the equivalent of 30 mg/day of prednisone or 9 mg/day of \nbudesonide is permitted for documented disease flare; however, the dose must be tapered to \nthe equivalent of 5 mg/day of prednisone or 3 mg/day of budesonide within 3 months.  \nPatients who fail to meet these corticosteroid tapering requirements will be withdrawn.\nPurposes for Amendment 3\n\uf0b7\nAllow patients who received azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate during \nprior participation in Study C13006 or Study C13007 to continue these medications in \nthis study\n\uf0b7\nAllow patients who are unable to complete the corticosteroid taper within the first \n6 months of the study to continue in the study  \n\uf0b7\nCorrect typographical, grammatical, contextual, and punctuation errors, as necessary.\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n96\n15.6   \nPurposes and Rationale for Amendment 4 (for use in Norway and the United \nKingdom)\nRationale for Amendment 4\nThis amendment, which is for use only in Norway and in the United Kingdom (UK), \nincorporates changes requested by the Norwegian Medicines Agency (NMA) and the \nMedicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  \nPurposes for Amendment 4\n\uf0b7\nChange the study length for patients enrolled in Norway and in the UK, based on a \nrequest by the NMA and MHRA, to a maximum of 100 weeks irrespective of \nmarketing authorization.\n\uf0b7\nAdd a requirement, based on a request by the MHRA, that patients enrolling in this \nstudy in the UK must have negative hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), \nand human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests within 4 months before enrollment.\n\uf0b7\nCorrect typographical, grammatical, contextual, and punctuation errors, as necessary\nVedolizumab (MLN0002)\nClinical Study Protocol C13008 Amendment 20\nConfidential\n97\n15.7   \nPurposes and Rationale for Amendment 5 (for use in all countries except the \nUS, Norway, and the United Kingdom)\nRationale for Amendment 5\nWith this amendment, the maximum duration of study treatment with MLN0002 is being \nincreased from 100 weeks to 196 weeks (approximately 46 months).  This increase accounts \nfor the maximum estimated time from enrollment of the first patient in the trial until \napproval for MLN0002.  Extension of the maximum treatment duration is supported by the \naccumulated safety data to date, including data from this open-label study.  This extension \nserves the dual purposes of providing patients who are deriving clinical benefit continued \naccess to MLN0002 and increasing our understanding of the long-term safety profile of this \ncompound.  Safety assessments, including the predose progressive multifocal \nleukoencephalopathy (PML) checklists and the Risk Assessment and Minimization for PML \n(RAMP), will continue during the entire course of the trial.  It should be noted that the total \nduration of study treatment is a maximum duration; if approval is obtained and MLN0002 \nbecomes available in a specific country while the study is still ongoing, the study may be \nterminated in that country.  \nThis amendment also will allow patients who participated in Study C13011 to continue \nMLN0002 treatment in this study (C13008).  Study C13011, a pivotal phase 3 induction \nstudy in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, has been added to the GEMINI program \n(Millennium\u2019s phase 3 pivotal program for vedolizumab [MLN0002] in Crohn\u2019s disease and \nulcerative colitis).  Patients who complete induction therapy and follow-up through Week 10 \nin Study C13011 may be eligible to enroll in this study.  \nAdditionally, the maximum time allowed from last dose of study drug in the prior qualifying \nMLN0002 study to first dose of MLN0002 in this study (C13008) has been increased from \n5 weeks to 9 weeks to allow more flexibility for patients to enroll in this study.  This \nextension is based on cumulative clinical pharmacology data in the entire vedolizumab \nprogram to date, as well as data from a recently completed study (C13004) that showed that \npatients tolerated an interruption in dosing longer than 5 weeks and were also able to derive \ntherapeutic benefit from subsequent dosing. \nSeveral other modifications have been made to the protocol in light of the increased duration \nof the study.  The observation time after first infusion has been modified from 2 hours to \n1 hour.  This modification is acceptable based on the considerable increase in accumulated \nsafety experience to date involving first and subsequent doses of MLN0002, since the prior \nversion of this protocol.\nGiven the long duration of the trial, it is likely that patients may require antibiotics, either \nfor control of symptoms for IBD or for infections, or may undergo surgery during the course \nof the trial.

This increase accounts \nfor the maximum estimated time from enrollment of the first patient in the trial until \napproval for MLN0002.  Extension of the maximum treatment duration is supported by the \naccumulated safety data to date, including data from this open-label study.  This extension \nserves the dual purposes of providing patients who are deriving clinical benefit continued \naccess to MLN0002 and increasing our understanding of the long-term safety profile of this \ncompound.

When the \nvedolizumab pivotal studies were planned in 2008, it was unclear if JC virus DNA testing in \nthe blood might be predictive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) risk.  \nMore recently, controlled studies of natalizumab (which has a proven risk of PML) have \nconclusively demonstrated that detection of JC virus DNA in the blood is of no clinical \nutility in minimizing risk of PML.(1)  Therefore, monitoring for JC virus DNA in the blood is \ndiscontinued with this amendment.  \nOther changes to the protocol allow for the use of conventional, nonbiological concomitant \nmedications for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be more consistent with standard \nclinical practice.  Thus, patients will now be allowed to start azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, \nmethotrexate (methotrexate for Crohn\u2019s disease only), or corticosteroids during the course of \nthe study, even if they were not on these medications when enrolled in the study.
