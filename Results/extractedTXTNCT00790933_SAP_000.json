The additional patients will increase the number of patients with exposure to \nvedolizumab and supplement the safety database to detect adverse events resulting from \nlong-term vedolizumab administration that may not be detected in the year-long induction \nand maintenance studies. The addition of 400 patients allows for the detection of adverse \nevents that occur at a prevalence of 0.1% to be detected with more than 85% likelihood, and \nevents that occur at a prevalence of 1% to be detected with 99.99% likelihood. Importantly, \nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria for the de novo patients are nearly identical to the criteria \nfor patients who enrolled in Studies C13006, C13007, and C13011; study treatment and \nassessments  are the same for these de novo patients as for rollover patients (those patients \nwho enrolled in C13008 following participation in C13004, C13006, C13007, or C13011). \nThe additional patients  are enrolled at a subset of existing sites in select countries, including \nthe United States (US).\nIn addition, with this protocol amendment, both rollover and de novo patients participating \nin C13008 will have access to vedolizumab until March 2016, or until vedolizumab is \navailable in the country in which the patient resides , or until patient withdrawal, whichever \ncomes first (unless the study is terminated early by the sponsor, as described in Section \n11.12 of study protocol).\nAnother change to the protocol includes removal of JC virus DNA testing. When the\nvedolizumab pivotal studies were planned in 2008, it was unclear if JC virus DNA testing in\nthe blood might be predictive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) risk.\nMore recently, controlled studies of natalizumab (which has a proven risk of PML) have\nconclusively demonstrated that detection of JC virus DNA in the blood is of no clinical\nutility in minimizing risk of PML. Therefore, monitoring for JC virus DNA in the blood  has \nbeen discontinued.\nOther changes to the protocol allow for the use of conventional, non-biological concomitant\nmedications for IBD to be more consistent with standard clinical practice. Thus, patients\nare now  allowed to start azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate (methotrexate for\nCD only), or corticosteroids during the course of the study, even if they were not on these\nVedolizumab\nStatistical Analysis Plan, Study C13008\nConfidential\n7\nmedications when enrolled in the study. In addition, oral corticosteroid regimens have been \nmodified to be more consistent with individual patient needs, and the corticosteroid tapering\nrequirement has been changed to a recommendation.\nThe definition of treatment failure that mandates withdrawal from the study has been\nmodified to \u201clong-term treatment failure\u201d to more accurately reflect true treatment failure\nthat occurs in clinical practice. Given the fluctuating natural history of inflammatory bowel\ndisease (IBD), patients may be treated for short-term disease worsening with conventional\ntherapies for IBD, as allowed per protocol, without being required to withdraw from the\nstudy. Accordingly, one of the criteria for the protocol-defined treatment failure, \u201cdisease\nworsening,\u201d that was based on disease activity indices (Harvey-Bradshaw Index and partial\nMayo score), has been removed from the definition of long-term treatment failure.\nImportantly, patients are still required to be withdrawn if they require rescue medication or\nmajor surgery for the treatment of IBD.\n",

Results of assessments \nfrom the last visit in the previous vedolizumab study are used to determine their eligibility to \nparticipate in this study. Baseline data are also obtained from the previous study, including \nmedical history, disease history, demographics, tobacco use, and prior therapies.\nIn addition, up to 400 patients without previous treatment with vedolizumab are enrolled \ndirectly into this study (de novo patients). Patients with UC or CD must meet the \ninclusion/exclusion criteria for de novo patients (Section 5 of study protocol).  \nBaseline data for these patients is obtained during the Screening period.\nFollowing enrollment, all patients are administered 300 mg vedolizomab every 4 weeks for \nthe duration of the study, followed by a 16-week post-treatment observation and safety\nassessment period. The total duration of MLN0002 treatment varies by patient based on\ncontinued benefit until March 2016, or until vedolizumab is available in the country in \nwhich the patient resides , or until patient withdrawal, whichever is sooner (unless the study \nis terminated early by the sponsor, as described in Section 11.12 of study protocol).\nPatients may receive allowed concomitant medications for the treatment of IBD as detailed\nin Section 6.2.1 of study protocol, as determined by the principal investigator, at any time \npoint during the study. Medications may be discontinued during the study, but if \ndiscontinuation is planned, it should be done prior to the first dose of vedolizumab.\nIt is strongly recommended that patients receiving oral corticosteroids  begin an oral\ncorticosteroid tapering regimen once they achieve clinical response or if, in the opinion of\nthe investigator, they demonstrate sufficient improvement in clinical signs and symptoms.\nPatients are withdrawn from the study for long-term treatment failure as described in the\nstudy definitions, or if they are not benefiting from therapy (see Section 6.2.3, Section \n6.4.10, and Section 7.4 of study protocol).\nAll patients  return 16 weeks after their last dose of MLN0002 for the Final Safety visit.\nSafety assessments and efficacy assessments using the partial Mayo Score (for patients with\nUC) or the HBI score (for patients with CD) will be made throughout the treatment period.\n",
