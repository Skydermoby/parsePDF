For the phase I part this endpoint will also be determined but will be considered as secondary only. In order to evaluate the objective response, the investigator's assessment as given in the eCRF will be taken into account (no central review and no check vs. bone marrow measurement is planned). Both investigator assessments (clinical progression as well as response assessment) will be taken into account for the determination of objective response. In particular this means that a patient is considered as \u2018progressive disease\u2019 if any of the assessments indicates a progression of the disease. No confirmation of a response / stable disease is necessary, i.e. in the following only unconfirmed responses are considered. Evaluation of objective response: The different categories possible for overall response (at a specific timepoint) are provided in section 9.6. In order to derive objective response the secondary endpoint best overall response will be derived first. The best overall response is the best overall response recorded during the time period from the start of the treatment until end of treatment period, progression or death whichever is earlier. Possible categories for best overall response are complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete blood recovery (CRi), partial remission (PR), no change (NC), Boehringer Ingelheim  TSAP for BI Trial No: 1230.4 Page 10 progressive disease (PD) and no assessment. Patients dying before any assessment will be summarized under PD regarding best overall response.

Start and end dates of concomitant therapies: The dates will be imputed such that the extent of exposure to concomitant therapy is maximal, i.e. the first day (month) of the month (year) for incomplete start dates and the last day (month) of the month (year) for incomplete end dates.

The conditional power for showing superiority of a treatment schedule with respect to the control schedule at a later time point will be evaluated assuming that the final analysis is the interim analysis of a larger trial. These calculations will be based on an O'Brien-Fleming design with interim analysis to stop for futility. The assumptions are an information fraction of 60% of patients, an overall type I error of 5% (one-sided), 15% objective response rate in the control vs. 30% objective response rate in experimental arm and a power of 65% as described in the CTP. The Boehringer Ingelheim  TSAP for BI Trial No: 1230.4 Page 31 conditional power will be computed under the current trend hypothesis [8.] using the standardized logarithm of the odd's ratio of proportions as a test statistic (approximately N(0,1) distributed).  will be used for these computations. Additionally, similar computations will be performed for other scenarios with a planned sample size of approximately 86 patients at the assumed interim analysis (25% information fraction, alpha=0.025 and power 90%, 33% information fraction, alpha=0.025 and power 80% as well as 40% information fraction, alpha=0.05 and power 80%). The conditional power will be evaluated in addition under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect and under the assumption that the true treatment effect (measured as the log odds ratio) captures only 50% of the observed treatment effect in order to check the robustness of the result. Odds ratios, confidence intervals, and Fisher\u2019s exact test will be used to compare treatments in an exploratory manner if appropriate. Additionally, objective response rates will be evaluated by a Bayesian approach with a non-informative prior (9.) given by a beta(1,1) distribution. Denoting the total number of patients per arm by n and the number of responders per arm by r this leads to a beta(1+r,1+n-r) distribution for the posterior (per arm separately). Based on this approach the following posterior probabilities will be evaluated: Probability that the treatment arm is at least as good as the control arm, probability that the treatment arm is at least 5% better than the control arm, probability that the treatment arm is at least 10% better than the control arm. Evaluation is performed based on simulating the posterior distribution for each arm m=1000000 times and by evaluating the respective characteristics. The exploratory nature of these analyses will be considered when interpreting the significance levels. P-values derived from statistical tests smaller than 5% will only be reported as nominally significant regarding the small sample size in each treatment schedule.

Adverse events will be coded with the most recent version of MedDRA. According to the BI standards, multiple occurrences of adverse events are collapsed to episodes if time overlapping or adjacent (maximal one day) on the MedDRA lowest level term and multiple episodes will be condensed to records on the preferred term and SOC level.  AEs as well as DLTs will be evaluated both for all courses as well as for first course only (in the phase I part). The analysis of adverse events will be based on the concept of treatment emergent adverse events. Adverse events will be distinguished for the period in which the subjects are under study drug (on-treatment) as well as for screening, and post-study (For details on the analysing treatment period, see section 6.1.3). If applicable, the actual dosage of BI 6727 administered on the day each adverse event starts will also be derived and will be included in the listing. The system organ classes will be sorted according to the standard sort order specified by EMEA, PTs will be sorted alphabetically (within SOC). All patients will be reported in the summary tables under the initial treatment group (randomised treatment) including the initial treatment schedule. AEs with onset date at Screening- and Post-study-period (as defined in Table 6.1.1: 1) will be displayed in two separate listings. Listings of screening events will not be sorted by initial treatment (Table 6.1.2: 1). But post-study listings will be sorted by initial treatment. AE flags and attributes An AE flag will be defined for patients who developed an AE that was CTCAE grade >= 3, DLT, or serious AE. An AE attribute \"CTCAE grade 3/4 or 5 combined with drug relation\" will be derived to avoid incorrect condensing. Consider, for instance, a patient with coincident drug-related abdominal pain with CTCAE 1, and non-related vomiting with CTCAE 3. Without the new attribute these AEs would be reported as drug-related Grade 3/4 under the SOC Gastrointestinal disorder. With the new AE attribute these AE would not be reported under that category. The number of patients with DLT will be listed per treatment group with the respective events fulfilling the criteria for DLT. A separate listing for all patients who developed AEs with CTCAE grade >= 3, DLT, and serious AEs will be generated. Incidence and intensity of adverse events The overall incidence and intensity of adverse events, as well as relatedness of adverse events to treatment with BI 6727 will be reported for all treatment schedule arms. Boehringer Ingelheim  TSAP for BI Trial No: 1230.4 Page 34 Serious adverse events will be tabulated. In addition, Events leading to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation will be examined, but may not be reported as individual tables, depending upon the extent of overlap with the occurrence of DLT. For the phase I part only, the dose-toxicity relationship will be examined descriptively and inferentially, using DLTs in treatment course 1 and DLTs up to the end of the on treatment phase, in separate analyses. Further, the time to first DLT will be explored descriptively in all dose groups, and Kaplan-Meier plots based upon the MTD group will be presented. As a first step, for each time period, the number of DLTs that a patient has will be summarised. If the majority of the patients have either 0 or 1 DLT, then a simple logistic regression will be calculated. If however, there are quite a few patients with >1 DLT, then a proportional odds model will be used. With this logistic regression, a model including only the BI 6727 dose (and intercept) will be used. Hence, by back-transformation of the logit model, the probability (and 95% confidence interval) of a DLT in this time period will be presented on a graph together with the dose. The dose corresponding to a 25% probability of a DLT in the time period will be indicated and the p-values for the intercept and slope of this model will also be included in the footnote. Additionally the expected toxicity level for the dose chosen in phase II will be provided. Finally, the time on treatment prior to the first DLT will be presented graphically together with the dose. Different symbols will be used for patients with (filled dot) and without (unfilled dot) a DLT.
