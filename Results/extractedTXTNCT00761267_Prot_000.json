                "Content": "The incidence of systemic invasive fungal infections has risen significantly in the past decade.  Infections due to Candida spp. account for about 80% of all systemic fungal infections and are the fourth leading cause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the United States.1 The impact of fungal infections on health care and economic expenditures is large and of growing concern.  Increases in infection rates are a consequence of growing numbers of at-risk patients due to advances in transplantation technology and oncology treatment, spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), use of vascular catheters, and extensive administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  In the United States, mortality rates in children with candidemia approach 30%, depending on the specific patient population and clinical setting.2, 3  Current approved treatments for infections due to Candida spp. include polyenes, azoles and echinocandin antifungal agents.  Of these, amphotericin B and fluconazole are the most commonly utilized in the paediatricpopulation.  Guidelines for use of these agents in the paediatric population have often been extrapolated from adult studies. Anidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal activity against Candida species.  In the United States, anidulafungin is approved for the treatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis).  In Canada and Europe, anidulafungin carries a similar indication and is approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia in adult non-neutropenic patients.To date, there are no clinical studies evaluating anidulafungin in paediatric subjects with invasive Candida infection.  This study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of anidulafungin in subjects 1 month to <18 years of age with ICC.  Exposure-response relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis.  090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)AnidulafunginA8851008Protocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016Page 22Additionally, due to the lack of excipient exposure/response data of polysorbate 80 in very young children (eg, < 2 years of age), the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) at the European Medicines Agency requested to measure plasma levels of the excipient polysorbate 80, a solubilizing agent contained in the intravenous (IV) formulation of anidulafungin.  Thus, pharmacokinetics of polysorbate 80 will also be explored.",

                        "Content": "Clinical PharmacologyAnidulafungin exhibits linear and predictable pharmacokinetics.  The pharmacokinetic profile of anidulafungin following IV administration is characterized by a short distribution half-life (t1/2,\u03b1) of 0.5-1 hour, a predominant elimination half-life (t1/2,\u03b2) of approximately 24 hours that characterizes the majority of the concentration-time profile, and a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2,\u03b3) of 40-50 hours.  Steady state is achieved on the first day after a loading dose (twice the daily maintenance dose).  Anidulafungin is extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%).Anidulafungin undergoes slow chemical degradation to produce a ring-opened peptide that lacks antifungal activity, which is subsequently converted to peptidic degradants and eliminated in feces.  Anidulafungin has negligible renal clearance (<1%).  It is not a clinically relevant substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes.  No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions were observed when anidulafungin was co-administered with cyclosporine, voriconazole, tacrolimus, amphotericin B or rifampin.  Dose adjustments are not required for subjects with any degree of hepatic or renal insufficiency, nor are they required on the basis of age, gender, weight, ethnicity, disease status, or concomitant medications.090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)Anidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 23\nIn the paediatric population, pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed in a Phase 1/2\nmulticenter, open-label, sequential dose-escalation study (from 0.75 mg/kg/day \nto 1.5 mg/kg/day) of IV anidulafungin administered as early empirical therapy to \n24 immunocompromised children ages 2 to 17 years with neutropenia.  Children were \nstratified by age, from 2 to 11 years and from 12 to 17 years.  There was no relationship \nbetween subject age and the peak concentration (Cmax), area under curve over dosing interval \n(AUC24), weight-normalized clearance (CL), or weight-normalized steady-state volume of \ndistribution (VSS).  The pharmacokinetic profiles on a weight-adjusted basis of 0.75 and \n1.5 mg/kg/day were similar to the profiles of anidulafungin administered to adults at dosages \nof 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively. \nThe pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin have not yet been characterized in subjects less than \n2 years of age.  Based upon prior studies and the pharmacokinetic properties of anidulafungin \n(eg, linear pharmacokinetics, minimal renal elimination and no hepatic metabolism), it is \nanticipated that the dose to be used in this age group will be the same as that of subjects aged \n2-17 years. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin will be studied in the first \n6 subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age to confirm the dosing regimen in this age \ngroup.  For all other subjects, sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected to explore the \nrelationship between anidulafungin exposure and response using a population PK-PD\nanalysis approach, including exploring the association between PK-PD index (eg, \nAUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)) and efficacy endpoints.  \nEfficacy in Invasive Candidiasis, including Candidemia (Adults) \nAnidulafungin was compared to fluconazole in a pivotal Phase 3, double-blind, randomized \nstudy of subjects aged 16 years and above with candidemia and other forms of invasive \ncandidiasis.  Subjects received either IV anidulafungin (200-mg on Day 1 and 100 mg daily \nthereafter) or IV fluconazole (800 mg on Day 1 and 400 mg daily thereafter, with dosage \nadjustment as necessary for renal insufficiency) for 14 to 42 days.  Subjects in either arm \ncould be switched to oral fluconazole (400 mg) after at least 10 days of IV treatment if \nprotocol-specified criteria were met.  There were 256 subjects in the Intent to Treat (ITT)\npopulation, of whom 131 received IV anidulafungin and 125 received IV fluconazole.  In the\nprimary efficacy analysis of global response (ie, microbiologic and clinical response) at the \nEnd of IV Therapy (EOIVT) in the Modified-ITT population, 75.6% of subjects randomized \nto anidulafungin had a successful response, compared to 60.2% for subjects randomized to \nfluconazole (95% CI 3.85, 26.99). \nFewer anidulafungin-treated subjects (30 [22.9%]) than fluconazole-treated subjects \n(39 [31.2%]) died during and shortly after the study.  At almost all time points throughout the \nstudy, the probability of survival for anidulafungin-treated subjects was higher than for \nfluconazole-treated subjects.  For subjects who died, the median time to death was 14 days \nfor fluconazole and 21 days for anidulafungin.  In subjects with forms of invasive candidiasis \nother than lone candidemia, 8 of 11 (72.7%) who received anidulafungin were considered \nglobal successes at the EOIVT compared with 8 of 15 (53.3%) subjects in the fluconazole \ngroup.\n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafunginA8851008Protocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016Page 24SafetyThe safety of anidulafungin has been assessed in 929 subjects, including 672 subjects in Phase 2/3 studies.  Treatment-related adverse events that were reported in \uf0b32% of subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 comparative candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis study in adults included diarrhea, increased alkaline phosphatase and hypokalemia.4Complete information for this compound may be found in the Single Reference Safety Document, which for this study is the Anidulafungin Investigator Brochure.5",

        "Content": "This prospective, open-label, non-comparative study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of anidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1 month and <18 years with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).To participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a confirmed diagnosis of ICC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or mycological evidence highly suggestive of Candida sp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic visualization of yeast, hyphae or pseudohyphae from a sample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  Subjects may enroll and initiate study treatment prior to culture confirmation of Candida sp.  If culture confirmation is not obtained, subjects may remain in the study and receive study treatment at the discretion of the investigator.  Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study treatment, the subject will discontinue study treatment but will remain in the study for continued safety monitoring for up to 6 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.  In order to accelerate the availability of PK and safety data in the lowest age group (1 month to < 2 years), the study population is broadened only in this age group to include children at risk for invasive candidiasis. Thus, eligibility criteria have been modified in Amendment 9 to additionally allow enrollment of infants (aged 1 month - < 2 years) who do not have 090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)Anidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 26\nmicrobiologically confirmed Candida but who are at high risk of candidiasis, and for whom \nthe investigator considers antifungal therapy with at least 5 days of IV anidulafungin to be \nappropriate.\nAll subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.

Subjects may be \nswitched to oral fluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after at least 5 days of \nIV anidulafungin treatment. \nThe maximum total treatment duration for all subjects in this study is 49 days, and the \nmaximum allowed treatment duration with anidulafungin is 35 days. The last day of study \ntreatment will be considered the End of Treatment (EOT).

In subjects with \nCandida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis who require continued treatment beyond the \nmaximum total treatment duration (49 days), this treatment will be considered outside the \ncontext of this clinical trial and study drug will not be supplied by the Sponsor.  For the \npurpose of study treatment evaluation, Day 35 (for subjects who require continued IV \ntreatment) or Day 49 (for subjects who required continued oral therapy) will be considered \nthe last day of study drug treatment.   These subjects are also required to return for the \n2-week and 6-week follow-up visit following the last dose of study drug.\nAll subjects enrolled in the study who receive at least one dose of study drug treatment, \nincluding those subjects who are discontinued from treatment (regardless of the reason), will \nbe followed for a total of 6 weeks after EOT (ie, the last dose of study drug treatment) and \nare required to return for the 2-week and 6-week follow-up visit.\nAll subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: physical examination, \nassessment of signs and symptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy test (for \nfemales of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen \nculture or histopathology of other normally sterile sites (as clinically indicated), and safety \nlaboratory testing.  If a positive culture is returned, repeat blood cultures are required at least \nevery 3 days until 2 cultures separated by 24 hours or more are confirmed to be negative.\nFor subjects without microbiologically confirmed ICC, further cultures will be drawn at the \ndiscretion of the investigator.\nAt selected investigator sites, anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first \n6 subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age to confirm whether or not the recommended \ndosing regimen contained within the protocol for this age group is appropriate.  These \nsubjects may be administered anidulafungin in one of two ways: either as monotherapy or in \ncombination with a second systemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B).  \nIf the investigator chooses to administer anidulafungin as monotherapy for the treatment of \ninvasive candidiasis/candidemia, then treatment will be administered for a minimum duration \nof 14 days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of two \nconsecutive negative cultures, separated by at least 24 hours, following the last positive \nculture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia or invasive \ncandidiasis.  \nIn the event the investigator choses to administer anidulafungin in combination with a second \nantifungal agent, anidulafungin will be discontinued following the obtainment of required \nblood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis as specified by the protocol; the data from these \nsubjects will not be utilized for secondary efficacy endpoint analyses but will be assessed for \nsafety.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed by the Sponsor, enrollment will be opened to \nadditional subjects within this age group at all investigator sites.  Subsequent to this time \npoint, the use of a second systemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will not be \npermitted in any subject.\n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 28\nA population PK-PD analysis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will \ninclude subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in \nwhich 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.  Additionally, at the request \nof PDCO, pharmacokinetics of polysorbate 80, a solubilizing agent contained in the IV\nformulation of anidulafungin, will also be explored.\nEfficacy will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and \nmicrobiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2-week FU and 6-week \nFU visits.  Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU \nvisits.

On Day 1, subject is to receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive a daily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day 2 onwards.    After a minimum of 10 days of treatment with IV anidulafungin, subjects with microbiologically confirmed ICC may be switched to oral fluconazole (6 \u2013 12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) provided that all of the following criteria are met:\uf0b7The subject is afebrile for at least 24 hour;\uf0b7The subject is able to tolerate oral medication;\uf0b7Documentation of two blood cultures negative for Candida spp separated by at least 24 hours;\uf0b7Eradication or presumed eradication of Candida sp. from any other sites of infection if identified at enrollment;\uf0b7The specific Candida isolate identified at study entry is susceptible (or presumed to be susceptible based on the species identified and local Candida sp. resistance patterns) to fluconazole;\uf0b7Signs and symptoms of Candida infection have improved such that the Investigator feels it is appropriate to switch to oral fluconazole.  090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)AnidulafunginA8851008Protocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016Page 37Treatment will continue for a minimum duration of 14 days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by at least 24 hours, following the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  Subjects without microbiologically confirmed Candida infection will be treated with IV anidulafungin at the discretion of the investigator to a maximum of 35 days.  Subjects may be switched to oral fluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after at least 5 days of IV anidulafungin treatment.The maximum total treatment duration for all subjects in this study is 49 days, and the maximum allowed treatment duration with anidulafungin is 35 days. The last day of study treatment will be considered the EOT.  Subjects will be followed in the study for a total of 6 weeks after EOT.  It is expected that the majority of subjects will receive study drug in the hospital; subjects will be permitted to complete study medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate by the investigator.(The following two paragraphs are not applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)** Important Note for Subjects with Candida Endocarditis and Candida Osteomyelitis**  The maximum total treatment duration in this study is 49 days, and the maximum allowed treatment duration with anidulafungin is 35 days.  After at least 10 days of treatment with anidulafungin, subjects may be switched to oral fluconazole (provided switch criteria are met) to complete treatment.In subjects with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis who require continued treatment beyond the maximum total treatment duration (49 days), this treatment will be considered outside the context of this clinical trial and study drug will not be supplied by the Sponsor.  For the purpose of study treatment evaluation, Day 35 (for subjects who require continued IV treatment) or Day 49 (for subjects who required continued oral therapy) will be considered the last day of study drug treatment.  These subjects are also required to return for the 2-week and 6-week follow-up visit following the last dose of study drug.",

Other examinations may also be performed at the discretion of the Investigator.b. Targeted physical examination: this is a simplified abbreviated and focused physical exam relevant to the patient\u2019s condition and progress as determined by the Investigator and includes the vital signs.c.Medical History: including (as appropriate) age, gender, medical history, surgical history, prior medications (only antifungal agents within 30 days prior to enrolment), adverse reactions to medications, and history of hepatic, renal, or cardiovascular systems.d. Signs and symptoms of Candida infection: The signs and symptoms of Candidainfection are diverse and dependent on disease severity, the site of infection and status of the host immune system. Constitutional symptoms suggestive of systemic infection include fever and sepsis (eg, tachycardia, hypotension). Infection of visceral organ(s) typically manifest as organ dysfunction and may include radiologic findings demonstrative of singular or multiple microabscesses. The most frequently observed signs and symptoms of commonly encountered forms of candidiasis are listed in the Case Report Form. However, the investigator is referred to the most recent clinical practice guidelines (published in March 2009), from the Infectious Diseases Society of America on the management of Candidiasis for comprehensive review of signs and symptoms associated with this disease.8",

If the study subject does not provide \nhis or her own consent, the source documents must record why the subject did not provide \nconsent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the \nperson signing the consent was the subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative, the consent \nsigner\u2019s relationship to the study subject (eg, parent, spouse), and that the subject\u2019s assent \nwas obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally it must be documented in the source \ndocuments.\nIf the study includes minor subjects who reach the age of majority during the study, as \nrecognized under local law, they must re-consent as adults to remain in the study.  If the \nenrollment of \u2018emancipated minors\u2019 is permitted by the study age criteria, the IRB/EC, and \nlocal law, they must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the \npermission of a parent or legal guardian.\nThe investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed \nconsent from each subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative, parent(s) or legal \nguardian and assent from each subject (if applicable) before any study-specific activity is \nperformed.  The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent/assent\ndocument.\n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafunginA8851008Protocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016Page 75",

Section Protocol Summary Background and Rationale, Paragraph 3\nChange From\nAnidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal \nactivity against Candida species.  In the United States, anidulafungin is approved for the \ntreatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscess and \nperitonitis) in adults.  To date, there are no clinical studies evaluating anidulafungin in \npaediatric patients with invasive Candida infection.  This study will assess the \npharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of anidulafungin in patients 1 month to <18 years of \nage with ICC.  Exposure-response relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a \npopulation pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis.\nChange To\nAnidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal \nactivity against Candida species.

Section Protocol Summary Study Design, Paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\nChange From\nAll subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  On Day 1, subject is \nto receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive \na daily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day 2 onwards.  \nSubjects will be stratified by age (1 month - <2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 - <18 years).  \nSubjects may be switched to oral fluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after \nat least 10 days of IV treatment, provided that the pre-specified criteria are met.\nAll subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: physical examination, \nassessment of signs and symptoms of Candida infection, urine pregnancy test (for females of \nchildbearing potential), chest X-ray, fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen \nculture or histopathology of other normally sterile sites (as clinically indicated), and safety \nlaboratory testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated on Days 3 and 7 and every third day \nthereafter until two cultures separated by at least 24 hours are confirmed to be negative.  Any \nnegative blood culture after Day 1 (per protocol schedule or otherwise) must be \nrepeated after 24 hours.\nAnidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects aged between \n1 month to <2 years, to be enrolled at selected centers.  Use of a second systemic antifungal \nagent (eg, amphotericin B) will be permitted for these 6 subjects only.  Three subjects in this \ncohort will be between 1 and <6 months of age and 3 subjects will be between 6 months and \n<2 years of age, which will be enrolled in parallel.  Data from these 6 subjects will not be \nutilized for secondary efficacy endpoint analyses but will be assessed for safety.  The \nexposure data from these subjects will be used to confirm if the recommended dosing \nregimen is appropriate for subjects aged <2 years.  After the PK data is evaluated and dosing \nregimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age will be permitted to be \nenrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a second systemic antifungal agent \n(eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted. \nA population PK-PD analysis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will \ninclude subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in \nwhich 3 to 4 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected. \nEfficacy will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and \nmicrobiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2-week FU and 6-week \nFU visits.  The main efficacy assessment will be determined at EOTEOIVT.  Rates of relapse \nand/or new infection will be assessed at the FU visits.  Safety will be evaluated through \nassessment of adverse events and monitoring of clinical laboratory tests (hematology and \nserum chemistry), temperature, and physical examination results.  All subjects will be \nfollowed for safety through the 6-week FU visit.  \n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 82\nChange To\nAll subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.

To date, there are no clinical studies evaluating anidulafungin in \npaediatric patients with invasive Candida infection.  This study will assess the \npharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of anidulafungin in patients 1 month to <18 years of \nage with ICC.

Section, PROTOCOL SUMMARY, Study Design\nChange From\nThis prospective, open-label, non-comparative study will assess the safety and efficacy of \nanidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1 month and <18 years with \ninvasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC)ICC.  The planned enrollment is 60 \nsubjects over 16 months at approximately 20-40 sites.  \nTo participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a \nconfirmed diagnosis of ICC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture \n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 135\nobtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or \nmycological evidence highly suggestive of Candida sp. (e.g., the growth of yeast in \nculture and/or the direct microscopic visualization of  yeast, hyphae or pseudohyphae \nfrom a sample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to \nenrolment).  In the latter case, culture confirmation of Candida sp. must be obtained \nwithin 96 hours post treatment initiation.  If culture confirmation is not obtained within \nthis time period, subjects will be discontinued from study treatment but will remain in \nthe study for continued safety monitoring.  These subjects will be required to return for \nthe 2-week and 6-week follow-up visits.\nAll subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  On Day 1, subject is to \nreceive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive a \ndaily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day 2 onwards.  Subjects \nwill be stratified by age (1 month - <2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 - <18 years).  Subjects may \nbe switched to oral fluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after at least 10 \ndays of IV treatment, provided that the pre-specified criteria are met.\nIt is expected that the majority of subjects will receive study drug in the hospital; subjects \nwill be permitted to complete study medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate \nby the investigator.  All subjects will receive treatment (either solely anidulafungin, or \nanidulafungin followed by oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration of 14 days from the \ntime of the last of negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative \ncultures, separated by at least 24 hours, following the last positive culture) and \nimprovement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  This will \nbe considered the End of Treatment (EOT). Total treatment duration with anidulafungin is \nnot to exceed 35 days.  Subjects will be followed in the study for a total of 6 weeks after \nEOT.  \nAll subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: physical examination, \nassessment of signs and symptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy test (for \nfemales of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen \nculture or histopathology of other normally sterile sites (as clinically indicated), and safety \nlaboratory testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated every three days (i.e., on Days 3 and 7) \nand every third day thereafter until two cultures separated by at least 24 hours are confirmed \nto be negative.  Any negative blood culture after Day 1 (per protocol schedule or otherwise) \nmust be repeated after 24 hours. \nAnidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects aged between \n1 month to <2 years, to be enrolled at selected centers.  Use of a second systemic antifungal \nagent (eg, amphotericin B) will be permitted for these 6 subjects only.  Three subjects in this \ncohort will be between 1 and <6 months of age and 3 subjects will be between 6 months and \n<2 years of age, which will be enrolled in parallel.  Data from these 6 subjects will not be \nutilized for secondary efficacy endpoint analyses but will be assessed for safety.  The \nexposure data from these subjects will be used to confirm if the recommended dosing \nregimen is appropriate for subjects aged <2 years.  After the PK data is evaluated and dosing \nregimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age will be permitted to be \n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 136\nenrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a second systemic antifungal agent \n(eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted. \nA population PK-PD analysis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will \ninclude subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in \nwhich 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.  \nEfficacy will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and \nmicrobiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2-week FU and 6-week \nFU visits.  Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU \nvisits.  Safety will be evaluated through assessment of adverse events and monitoring of \nclinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry), temperature, and physical \nexamination results.  All subjects will be followed for safety through the 6-week FU visit.  \nThe planned enrolment is 60 evaluable subjects (those subjects who have received at \nleast one dose of anidulafungin and have confirmed Candida infection).\nWe plan to amend this protocol at a future time to allow for the enrollment of neonates (from \n0 to 1 month of age) when additional pharmacokinetic data are available for this patient \npopulation.\nChange To\nThis prospective, open-label, non-comparative study will assess the safety and efficacy of \nanidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1 month and <18 years with \ninvasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).  \nTo participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a confirmed \ndiagnosis of ICC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture obtained from a \nnormally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or mycological evidence highly \nsuggestive of Candida sp. (e.g., the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic \nvisualization of  yeast, hyphae or pseudohyphae from a sample obtained from a normally \nsterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).

The \nexposure data from these subjects will be used to confirm if the recommended dosing \nregimen is appropriate for subjects aged <2 years.  After the PK data is evaluated and dosing \nregimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age will be permitted to be \nenrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a second systemic antifungal agent \n(eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted. \nA population PK-PD analysis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will \ninclude subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in \nwhich 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.  \nEfficacy will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and \nmicrobiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2-week FU and 6-week \nFU visits.  Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU \nvisits.  Safety will be evaluated through assessment of adverse events and monitoring of \nclinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry), temperature, and physical \nexamination results.  All subjects will be followed for safety through the 6-week FU visit.  \nThe planned enrolment is 60 evaluable subjects (those subjects who have received at least \none dose of anidulafungin and have confirmed Candida infection).\nWe plan to amend this protocol at a future time to allow for the enrollment of neonates (from \n0 to 1 month of age) when additional pharmacokinetic data are available for this patient \npopulation.\n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 138\n4.

STUDY DESIGN\nChange From\nThis prospective, open-label, non-comparative study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety \nand efficacy of anidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1 month and \n<18 years with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).  The planned enrollment is \n60 subjects over 16 months at approximately 20-40 sites.  \nTo participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a \nconfirmed diagnosis of ICC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture \nobtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or \nmycological evidence highly suggestive of Candida sp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture \n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 148\nand/or the direct microscopic visualization of yeast, hyphae or pseudohyphae from a \nsample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  In the \nlatter case, culture confirmation of Candida sp. must be obtained within 96 hours post \ntreatment initiation.  If culture confirmation is not obtained within this time period, \nsubjects will be discontinued from study treatment but will remain in the study for \ncontinued safety monitoring.  These subjects will be required to return for the 2-week \nand 6-week follow-up visits.\nAll subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  Enrollment will be \nstratified by age (1 month - <2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 - <18 years), allowing 20 + 2 in \neach stratum.  Subjects may be switched to oral fluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum \n800 mg/day) after at least 10 days of IV anidulafungin treatment, provided that all of the \nfollowing criteria are met:\n\uf0b7\nThe subject is afebrile for at least 24 hours;\n\uf0b7\nThe subject is able to tolerate oral medication;\n\uf0b7\nDocumentation of two blood cultures negative for Candida spp separated by at least \n24 hours;\n\uf0b7\nDocumentation of a negative culture for Candida spp from any other sites of infection \nidentified at enrollment;\n\uf0b7\nThe specific Candida isolate identified at study entry is susceptible to fluconazole;\n\uf0b7\nSigns and symptoms of Candida infection have improved such that the Investigator \nfeels it is appropriate to switch to oral fluconazole.\nIt is expected that the majority of subjects will receive study drug in the hospital; subjects \nwill be permitted to complete study medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate \nby the investigator.\nAll subjects will receive treatment (either solely IV anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed \nby oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration of 14 days from the time of the last of negative \nculture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by at least \n24 hours, following the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and \nsymptoms of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  This will be considered the EOT.  Total \ntreatment duration with anidulafungin is not to exceed 35 days.  Subjects will be followed in \nthe study for a total of 6 weeks after EOT.  \nAll subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: physical examination, \nassessment of signs and symptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy test (for \nfemales of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen \nculture or histopathology of other normally sterile sites (as clinically indicated), and safety \nlaboratory testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated every three days (ie, on Days 3 and 7)\nand every third day thereafter until two cultures separated by at least 24 hours are confirmed \n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 149\nto be negative.

Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU \nvisits.  Safety will be evaluated through assessment of adverse events and monitoring of \nclinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry), temperature, and physical \nexamination results.  All subjects will be followed for safety through the 6-week FU visit.  \nThe planned enrolment is 60 evaluable subjects (those subjects who have received at \nleast one dose and confirmed Candida infection).\nWe plan to amend this protocol at a future time to allow for the enrollment of neonates (from \n0 to 1 month of age) when additional pharmacokinetic data are available for this patient \npopulation.\nChange To\nThis prospective, open-label, non-comparative study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety \nand efficacy of anidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1 month and \n<18 years with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).  \nTo participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a confirmed \ndiagnosis of ICC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture obtained from a \nnormally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or mycological evidence highly \nsuggestive of Candida sp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic \nvisualization of  yeast, hyphae or pseudohyphae from a sample obtained from a normally \nsterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  In the latter case, culture confirmation of \nCandida sp. must be obtained within 96 hours post treatment initiation.  If culture \nconfirmation is not obtained within this time period, subjects will be discontinued from study \n090177e18f1c6d2d\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 12:55 (GMT)\nAnidulafungin\nA8851008\nProtocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016\nPage 150\ntreatment but will remain in the study for continued safety monitoring.
