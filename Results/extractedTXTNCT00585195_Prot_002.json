INTRODUCTION\n1.1. Background\nHuman cancers comprise a diverse array of diseases that collectively are one of the leading \ncauses of death in developed countries throughout the world (American Cancer Society, \n2005).1  The progression of cancers is caused by a complex series of multiple genetic and \nmolecular events including gene mutations, chromosomal translocations, and karyotypic \nabnormalities (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2000).3  Although the underlying genetic causes of \ncancer are both diverse and complex, each cancer type has been observed to exhibit common \ntraits and acquired capabilities that facilitate its progression.  These acquired capabilities \ninclude dysregulated cell growth, sustained ability to recruit blood vessels (ie, angiogenesis), \nand ability of tumor cells to spread locally as well as metastasize to secondary organ sites \n(Hanahan & Weinberg, 2000).3  Therefore, the ability to identify novel therapeutic agents \nthat 1) inhibit molecular targets that are altered during cancer progression or 2) target \nmultiple processes that are common to cancer progression in a variety of tumors is predicted \nto yield improved therapeutic benefit.\nPF-02341066\nChemical Structure:\nO\nCl\nCl\nF\nN\nNH2\nN\nN\nNH\nChemical Name: \n(R)-3-[1-(2,6-Dichloro-3-fluoro-phenyl)-ethoxy]-5-(1-piperidin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-pyridi\nn-2-ylamine\nMolecular Formula: C21H22Cl2FN5O\nPF-02341066 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition\nfactor)/HGFR receptor tyrosine kinase.  The rationale for use of this mechanism to treat \ncancer is supported by an emerging paradigm in oncology that robust clinical efficacy can be \nobtained with well-tolerated inhibitors directed toward oncogenic tyrosine kinases that are \ngenetically altered through activating mutations, gene translocations, or gene amplification.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 44\nRecent examples include Gleevec\u00ae in gastrointestinal stromal tumors with mutant c-Kit or \nchronic myelogenous leukemia with BCR-Abl gene translocations, Tarceva\u00ae in non-small \ncell lung cancer with mutant EGFR, Herceptin\u00ae in breast cancers with amplified HER-2/neu, \nand SU11248 targeting the VHL-dependent VEGF pathway in renal cell carcinoma.  An \nextensive body of literature indicates that MET/HGFR is one of the most frequently mutated \nor otherwise abnormally activated RTKs in various human cancers (Christensen et al, 2005).2  \nTumor types in which MET/HGFR was reported to be genetically altered by mutation or \ngene amplification include oncology indications with a strong unmet medical need such as \nrenal, metastatic colorectal, glioma, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers \n(Christensen et al, 2005).2  In addition, PF-02341066 demonstrated potent activity against \nNPM-ALK, an oncogenic fusion protein variant of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase, which \nresults from a chromosomal translocation which is implicated in the pathogenesis of human \nanaplastic large cell lymphoma (Pulford et al, 2004).4  In addition to the rationale for \nPF-02341066 based on the genetic dysregulation of its tyrosine kinase targets, an additional \nrationale is based on its predicted ability to target multiple processes that are common to \ncancer progression in a variety of tumors.  Inappropriate activation of MET/HGFR (including \nwild-type MET) is implicated in dysregulation of multiple tumor oncogenic processes such \nas mitogenesis, survival, angiogenesis, invasive growth, and especially in the metastatic \nprocess (Christensen et al, 2005).2  Furthermore, the expression of MET and HGF, its sole, \nhigh-affinity ligand, were demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis or metastatic \nprogression in a number of major human cancers (Christensen et al, 2005).2  The other \nmolecular target of PF-02341066, NPM-ALK, is implicated in the dysregulation of cell \nproliferation and apoptosis in ALCL lymphoma cells (Pulford et al, 2004).4  Consistent with \nits predicted mechanism of action, PF-02341066 inhibited target-dependent tumor cell \nproliferation or invasion, induced tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited angiogenesis in \nnonclinical tumor models.  Oral administration of PF-02341066 also demonstrated efficacy, \nincluding marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed \nactivated MET/HGFR or NPM-ALK.  The collective rationale for investigation of \nPF-02341066 in clinical studies is built on genetic alteration of its molecular targets, its \npredicted ability to target multiple processes that are common to cancer progression, and \npreclinical efficacy data. \nSafety:\nThe primary PF-02341066 toxicities in nonclinical studies were observed in the \ngastrointestinal tract (rat, dog, monkey), hematopoietic system (rat, dog, monkey), kidneys \n(rat), reproductive organs (rat), and actively growing long bones (rat).  Additional effects \nrelated to PF-02341066 administration involved the cardiovascular system based on safety \npharmacology studies, and genetic toxicity findings.  Other findings of uncertain risk to \nhumans include the decreased cellularity in lymphoid organs, elevated liver enzymes, \npotential for phototoxicity, and effects on the salivary glands.\nGastrointestinal Effects: Clinical signs of diarrhea were observed in rats (500 mg/kg/day), \ndogs (\uf0b36 mg/kg/day), and monkeys (50 mg/kg/day).  Focal edema was observed in the \ngastric submucosa in rats given 500 mg/kg/day for 4 days, as well as focal ulceration, \ninflammation, and glandular hyperplasia in one female.  Gastrointestinal effects were not \nobserved in the 1-month study in rats, where doses were tolerated for the full term of the \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 45\nstudy.  Emesis and diarrhea were dose-limiting toxicities observed during the single-dose \nescalation range-finding study in dogs.  Following single doses of 10, 25, and 40 mg/kg, \nsevere gastrointestinal effects were observed, including bloody emesis and diarrhea, along \nwith mucous membranes in the feces.  Histopathological examination of the intestines \nrevealed blood-filled dilated mucosal and submucosal vessels (congestion) and luminal \ncontents of mucus admixed with low numbers of neutrophils.  In the 1-month study in dogs, \nPF-02341066 at \uf0b36 mg/kg/day induced emesis, the incidence and frequency of which \ndecreased as the study progressed, and occasional diarrhea.  There was no effect on food \nconsumption or body weight, and no histopathological correlate was identified at the end of\nthe study.  Diarrhea and soft feces were also observed in monkeys given 50 mg/kg/day of \nPF-02341066.  A decrease in phosphorus observed in this study may have been related to \ndecreased intestinal absorption.  Marked cecal erosion and ulceration were observed in one \nmonkey euthanized moribund on Day 21. \nKidney Effects: Microscopic evidence of minimal to mild renal cortical tubule vacuolation \nwas observed following 28 days of dosing in male rats treated with \uf0b350 mg/kg/day of \nPF-02341066.  Urinalysis revealed significant decreases in urine pH from 50 mg/kg/day in \nmales and at 150 mg/kg/day in females.  The mechanism for renal tubular vacuolation is not \nknown, however HGF is highly expressed in the kidney tubular epithelium (Birchmeier, \n2003)5 with reported cytoprotective effects on renal tubular epithelium (Liu, 1998).6  \nTestes Effects: Microscopic evidence of minimal testicular pachytene spermatocyte \ndegeneration was observed in rats given \uf0b350 mg/kg/day of PF-02341066 for 28 days.  The \nmechanism responsible for the degenerative effects in the testes is not understood, however \nMET is known to be expressed on human seminiferous epithelium and on immature and \nmature spermatozoa (Depuydt, 1996).7\nHematopoietic Effects: Bone marrow hypocellularity was observed in toxicity studies in rats \nand monkeys with PF-02341066.  Repeated administration of PF-02341066 for 28 days \ncaused bone marrow hypocellularity at doses of 150 mg/kg/day (rats, males only) and \n50 mg/kg/day (monkeys).  Minimal bone marrow hypocellularity was also produced in rats \nof both sexes when PF-02341066 was administered for shorter time duration (2 days at \n2000 mg/kg and 4 days at 500 mg/kg/day).  Bone marrow hypocellularity was not observed \nin dogs, however a decrease in white blood cells was identified following 3 single doses up \nto 40 mg/kg and 7 days of PF-02341066 at 20 mg/kg/day.  In monkeys, cytospin examination \nshowed evidence of increased numbers of macrophages and debris consistent with bone \nmarrow cytotoxicity, and correlated with the bone marrow hypocellularity observed \nhistopathologically.  Hematological analysis revealed decreased reticulocyte counts and\nsuggested suppression of erythroid production within the bone marrow.  In addition, WBC \nprecursors lacked granulation characteristically present in these cells suggesting potential \nperoxidase deficiency in granulocytes.  This change in granulation was also noted in dogs \ngiven 20 mg/kg/day for 28 days.  Vacuolated lymphocytes were identified in male rats given \n150 mg/kg/day, the significance of which is unclear. \nLymphoid Tissue Effects: Lymphoid depletion was observed in the thymus, spleen, lymph \nnodes, or GALT in rats and dogs given PF-02341066.  Findings in rats given 500 mg/kg/day \nfor 4 days were attributed to stress (stress leukogram and clinical signs of intolerance were \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 46\nobserved).  Decreased cellularity was also observed in lymphoid organs in the 1-month study \nin rats at \uf0b350 mg/kg/day, however, these findings were considered of uncertain origin.  \nDecreased thymus weight (\uf0b36 mg/kg/day) correlated to thymic lymphoid depletion in male \ndogs given 20 mg/kg/day PF-02341066 for 28 days, and was also considered to be of \nuncertain relationship to treatment. \nCardiovascular Effects: In vivo cardiovascular effects were observed in the safety \npharmacology study in anesthetized dogs.  PF-02341066 administration was associated with \ndecreases in heart rate and increases in LVEDP at 84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma \nconcentration.  There were also statistically significant differences compared with \nvehicle-treated animals in myocardial contractility (LV+dP/dt) at 164 ng/mL free plasma \nconcentration.  Although there was a statistically significant decrease in myocardial \ncontractility, it should be noted that the actual myocardial contractility values in the treated \nanimals were similar to the pre-dose values.  The main effects of PF-02341066 on ECG \nparameters were statistically significant increases in PR interval, QRS, and QT interval at \n84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma concentration.  The prolongation of PR-interval, QRS and \nQT-interval is probably due to the reduction in heart rate observed at these doses.  \nMonophasic action potential duration during cardiac pacing is a heart rate-independent index \nof cardiac repolarization.  There were statistically significant increases in MAPD100 at sinus \nrhythm at 84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma concentration.  The increases in MAPD100 at sinus \nrhythm were consistent with the decreases observed in heart rate.  The plasma concentrations \nof PF-02341066 achieved in this study were up to 44 times the free efficacious plasma level \npredicted in humans (8.1 nM or 3.7 ng/mL).  In vitro, PF-02341066 blocked potassium \ncurrents or human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel conduction with IC50 and IC20\nvalues of 1.1 \uf06dM (495 ng/mL) and 0.3 \uf06dM (135 ng/mL), respectively.  In the rat aortic \ntension model, in vitro dog isolated Purkinje fibers, and in freshly isolated Guinea pig \nventricular myocytes, PF-02341066 produced effects consistent with calcium channel \nantagonism.  The hERG assay, rat aortic model, Guinea pig myocyte assay, and Purkinje \nfiber data suggest that PF-02341066 is mixed-channel blocker and this may explain the lack \nof effect on MAPD100 during pacing in this study.  The decrease in diastolic blood pressure \nobserved at a free plasma concentration of 164 ng/mL may reflect the calcium channel \nantagonist effects observed in the rat isolated aorta model.  The nonclinical data suggest that \nfree plasma concentrations greater than or equal to 84 ng/mL may produce changes in the \nheart rate and at higher free plasma concentrations (164 ng/mL) changes in diastolic blood \npressure.\nBone Effects: Repeated administration of PF-02341066 for 28 days caused minimal \ndecreased bone formation at the primary spongiosa of growing long bones at a dose of \n150 mg/kg/day in male rats.  Though an off-target relationship cannot be ruled out, reports of \nin vitro data describe possible autocrine regulation of osteoclasts, paracrine regulation of \nosteoblasts (Grano, 1996),8 and modulation of bone resorptive activity of osteoclasts in \nresponse to HGF (Fuller, 1995),9 that may be suggestive of a pharmacological effect on bone.  \nThis toxicity is not expected in the adult patient population, whose growth plates are inactive.\nLiver Effects: An elevation in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate \naminotransferase [AST]) was observed in rats and monkeys given PF-02341066. Rats given \n2000 mg/kg/day for 2 days, 500 mg/kg/day for 4 days, or \uf0b350 mg/kg/day for 28 days showed \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 47\nan elevation in liver enzymes without a microscopic correlate.  Monkeys given 50 mg/kg/day \nof PF-02341066 also had elevated ALT and AST without histological correlate.  The \nelevation of liver enzymes is of uncertain relevance.\nGenotoxic Effects: PF-02341066 was associated with an increased frequency of structural \nchromosomal aberrations in the in vitro cytogenetics assay with and without metabolic \nactivation under the 3-hour test condition.  In addition to the clastogenic response, the \nkinetochore staining results from the in vitro micronucleus evaluation and the observation of \npolyploidy in the cytogenetics assay were consistent with an aneugenic response to\nPF-02341066.  Increased incidences in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (and \nmicronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes) were observed at all doses evaluated in vivo \n(rat) in males only.  The increases in micronuclei were associated with changes in other bone \nmarrow parameters consistent with bone marrow toxicity. \nPhototoxic Effects: PF-02341066 potential for phototoxicity was evaluated due to significant \nabsorbance in the UVA-UVB/visible range from 290 to 700 nm with a molar extinction \ncoefficient of \u22651000 L/Mol/cm, and its photodegradative property.  PF-02341066 was \nevaluated in the 3T3 fibroblast NRU assay with probable phototoxicity results.  Distribution \nof PF-02341066 to tissues with likely sun exposure is not known.  Patients will be advised to \navoid excessive sun exposure while on trial, eg by wearing long sleeve clothing and \nsunglasses and applying sunscreen when outdoors.\nOther Effects: Single-cell necrosis was observed in the ovaries and salivary glands of rats \ngiven 500 mg/kg/day that were euthanized on Day 4 due to moribundity.  Mild depletion of \nsecretory material was also observed in the salivary glands.  Effects in the ovaries and \nsalivary glands were not observed in the subsequent 1-month study.  Increases in WBC \ncounts were observed in the rat and monkey, consistent with an inflammatory response. \nComplete information on PF-02341066 may be found in the Single Reference Safety \nDocument (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator\u2019s Brochure.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 48\nFigure 2.\nSummary of 1-Month Repeat-Dose Toxicodynamics for PF-02341066\n1.2. Rationale\nMET/HGFR has been well characterized for its role in regulation of cell growth, migration, \nand invasion of both tumor cells and endothelial cells.  An extensive body of literature \nindicates that MET/HGFR is one of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) most frequently \nmutated or otherwise abnormally activated in late-stage human cancer.  When activated, \nMET/HGFR plays a critical role in regulation of tumor oncogenic processes such as \nmitogenesis, survival, and invasive growth, and especially in the metastatic process.  \nAdditionally, the emerging role of MET/HGFR in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis \nindicates potential for dual anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic mechanisms.  Activating \nmutations in MET/HGFR have been identified in multiple patient populations, including \nNSCLC (Non Small Cell Lung Cancer), SCLC (Small Cell Lung Cancer), renal cancers, \nhead and neck cancers, and hepatocellular cancer.  In addition to activation driven by \nmutation, MET/HGFR gene amplification/ overexpression resulting in increased kinase \nactivity has been frequently observed in gastric and colorectal cancer patients.  Furthermore, \nMET/HGFR is also activated in human tumors by other mechanisms (eg, autocrine loops, \nparacrine activation from tumor-associated stroma).  Collectively, the dysregulation of \nMET/HGFR in tumors by multiple mechanisms along with the potential role of MET/HGFR \nin tumor angiogenesis comprises a large potential patient population.  Most importantly, in \npreclinical proof of concept studies, both neutralizing monoclonal antibody and RTK \ninhibitor exhibit convincing antitumor activity in several xenograft models, which supports \nthe concepts that MET is a valid target for treatment of cancer.\nMutations in MET Exon 14 were previously reported to be oncogenic drivers in preclinical \nmodels of lung cancer (Ma et al, 2003; Ma et al, 2006; Kong-Beltran et al, 2006).22,23,24\nGiven the role of MET/HGFR in regulation of cell growth, migration, and invasion of both \ntumor cells and endothelial cells, there is increasing interest in understanding the potential \neffectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a treatment in NSCLC patients with tumors \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 49\nharboring MET Exon 14 alterations. Paik et al (2015) reported on 3 crizotinib-treated \npatients with NSCLC harboring alterations leading to MET Exon 14 skipping. All 3\ncrizotinib-treated patients were shown to have a partial response.21  \nIn conclusion, MET has been shown to be a valid target, and PF-02341066 is a potent and \nselective inhibitor of MET.  PF-02341066 exhibits convincing antitumor activity in several \nxenograft models.  Importantly, it delivers antitumor efficacy in xenograft models with a \nlarge safety window, providing increased confidence that mechanism-based toxicity will not \nbe limiting in the clinic.\n1.2.1. Rationale for Selection of Starting Dose\nThe starting dose for PF-02341066 in the first in human (FIH) trial in cancer patients has \nbeen determined to be 50 mg daily, based on information derived from the 1-month repeat \ndose toxicology studies in rats and dogs (see current IB).\nThe doses tested in the 1-month toxicology rat study were 10, 50, and 150 mg/kg/day orally \nand the doses in the 1-month dog study were 1, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day orally.  In the rat study, \nthere were no deaths at any dose levels.  The NOAEL identified in the rat study was \n10 mg/kg/day.  Only mild to moderate toxicities were observed at the highest dose \n(150 mg/kg), indicating that the STD10 in rats was greater than 150 mg/kg (900 mg/m2).  \nThere was a significant gender difference suggesting that the male rat was more sensitive \nthan the female, associated with increased plasma exposure of PF-02341066 in male rats.  In \nthe dog study, no serious, irreversible toxicities were observed at any dose level.  Hence, the \nNOAEL was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day in the dog study.\nAccording to DeGeorge et al. (1998),10 the currently accepted algorithm for calculating a \nstarting dose in clinical trials for cytotoxic agents is to use one-tenth of the dose that causes \nsevere toxicity (or death) in 10% of the rodents (STD10) on a mg/m2 basis, provided this \nstarting dose does not cause serious, irreversible toxicity in a non-rodent species.  If \nirreversible toxicities are produced at the proposed starting dose in non-rodents or if the \nnon-rodent is known to be the more appropriate animal model, then the starting dose would \ngenerally be one-sixth of the highest dose tested in the non-rodent that does not cause severe, \nirreversible toxicity.  Since one-tenth of the highest dose tested in rats (90 mg/m2, equivalent \nto 4.5 mg/kg in dogs) did not cause any serious, irreversible toxicity in dogs, the starting dose \nin humans can be estimated as 90 mg/m2, ie, 150 mg daily dose, assuming body surface area \nof 1.7 m2 for humans.\nHowever, the 150 mg starting dose in humans would project a PF-02341066 plasma exposure \n(steady-state plasma AUC of 3.26 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL) exceeding the NOAEL (AUC of 2.16 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL \nat 10 mg/kg) in male rats, the most sensitive species.  Furthermore, since the plasma protein \nbinding for PF-02341066 is lower in humans (90.7%) than in rats (94.3%), the unbound \nAUC (AUCu) in humans (0.303 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL) at the 150 mg starting dose will be higher than \nthat at the NOAEL in rats (0.123 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL).  In humans, a dose of 61 mg is expected to yield \nan unbound drug plasma AUC approximately equal to that observed in rats at the NOAEL.  \nSince the exposure-based human dose projection provides a lower estimate for the clinical \nstarting dose (61 mg) than that based on 1/10 of the STD10 in rats (150 mg), this dose \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 50\nrounded to 50 mg (the highest available strength for a single capsule) once daily will be used \nas the starting dose for the FIH study.\n1.2.2. Rationale for Evaluation of Midazolam (MDZ) Interaction\nPF-02341066 is predominantly metabolized via the CYP3A isozymes in human liver \nmicrosomes and hepatocytes.  PF-02341066 also showed time-dependent inhibition of \nCYP3A isozymes in human liver microsomes with a kinact of 0.11 min-1 and KI of 3.0 \u03bcM.  \nBased on these values, the projected PF-02341066 therapeutic dose of 100 mg (Cmax, free\n19 nM) is predicted to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of co-administered drugs that \nare CYP3A substrates by approximately 80% due to CYP3A inhibition.  There is a potential \nfor more potent inhibition in patients receiving higher doses, leading to substantial drug \ninteractions with commonly coadministered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.  In addition, \nPF-02341066 may display nonlinear pharmacokinetics in patients that may require dose \nadjustments.  To mitigate these risks, a MDZ interaction sub-study has been built into this \nFirst in Human (FIH) study to assess the potential PF-02341066 related CYP3A inhibition. \nMDZ is a benzodiazepine used clinically for conscious sedation.  It undergoes extensive \nmetabolism via CYP3A4/5 and is a widely accepted in-vivo probe for assessing CYP3A \nactivity.  In the current trial, midazolam pharmacokinetics (PK) following a single oral 2-mg \ndose will be evaluated before and after repeated daily administration of PF-02341066 at 3 \ndose levels (the next higher dose after the initial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D),\nin order to assess the effects of PF-02341066 on CYP3A activity in the GI tract and the liver.  \nThe results of MDZ interaction study will be used to assist selection of the RP2D and to \ndetermine if there is any need for concomitant medication restrictions or dose modifications \nin future studies. \n2.

The investigator or his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will confirm the \npatient has selected 2 appropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from \nthe list of permitted contraception methods (see below), and will confirm the patient has been \ninstructed in their consistent and correct use. Patients need to affirm that they meet the \ncriteria for correct use of two of the selected methods of contraception. The investigator or \nhis/her designee will discuss with the patient the need to use 2 highly effective contraceptive \nmethods consistently and correctly according to the Schedule of Activities and document \nsuch conversation and, upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #23, the patient\u2019s affirmation \nin the patient\u2019s chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if 1 or both of the selected contraceptive methods is discontinued or if \npregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the patient\u2019s partner. \nHighly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a \nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and \ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected, implanted or transdermal hormonal \nmethods of contraception are allowed provided the patient plans to remain on the \nsame treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal \ncontraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 59\n2. Correctly placed copper containing intrauterine device (IUD). \n3. Male condom or female condom used WITH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, \nsuppository).

Refer to Appendix 6 for \nfurther details.\n4.5.2. Sunlight Exposure\nPatients treated with PF-02341066 should avoid sunbathing, prolonged unprotected sun \nexposure, or tanning for the duration of the study. \n4.5.3. Dietary Restrictions\nThere is special requirement for patients who will participate in the MDZ interaction \nsub-study:\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 60\n\uf0b7\nPatients should not eat or drink products containing grapefruit from 7 days prior to \nenrollment until 24 hours after completion of MDZ administration on C2D1.\nFor patients enrolled in the rifampin interaction sub-study, refer to Appendix 6 for further \ndetails.\nFor patients enrolled in the itraconazole interaction sub-study, refer to Appendix 7 for \nfurther details.\n4.6. Sponsor\u2019s Qualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the \nstudy is documented in the study contact list located in the Investigational Site Folder.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical \nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card.  The contact card contains, \nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study numbers, \ncontact information for the investigational site, and contact details for a contact center in the \nevent that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical \nquestion or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the \npatient\u2019s participation in the study.  The contact number can also be used by investigational \nstaff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used \nonly in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational \nsite and the study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, \nthe established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team \nfor advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study.  The contact\nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly, and if a patient calls that number, he or \nshe will be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. TRIAL TREATMENTS\nFor the purposes of this study, and per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) \nguidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active \ningredient being tested in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization \nwhen used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved \nform, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information \nabout an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).  \nFor this study, the investigational product is PF-02341066.\nPF-02341066 will be administered orally once or twice a day in continuous 28-day cycles \nexcept 21-day cycles for patients in the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort (see Schedule \nof Activities and Appendix 8).\nThere will be a lead-in period in which single-dose pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 or \nMDZ (for patients participating in the MDZ sub-study) will be characterized prior to \ninitiation of continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment.  With the exception of cohorts \nin which the evaluation of a MDZ interaction is scheduled or patients who are exempted \nfrom the Day -7 lead-in dose (see below), all other patients will receive a single dose of \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 61\nPF-02341066 seven days prior to the start of Cycle 1 (Day \u20137) in order to characterize the \ncomplete PK profile of PF-02341066 after a single dose.  With the approval of \nAmendment #13, only patients enrolled in the QD dose escalation part of the study or Asian \npatients enrolled in any cohort will have the Day -7 lead-in dose.  Patients enrolled in the \nMDZ interaction sub-study will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on Day \u20137.  These \npatients will receive another single 2-mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with PF-02341066 \non Cycle 2 Day 1.  During the study, real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring will be conducted \nas much as possible.\nThe PF-02341066 dose regimen may be changed if the pharmacokinetics and safety data \nsuggest that a discontinuous regimen or another dosing frequency may be preferable.  If a \nBID dosing regimen is incorporated, all study assessments will be based on morning dosing \n(Day -7 dosing will still be a single PF-02341066 dose).  Dosing of oral PF-02341066 will \nbe based on flat milligram increments without adjustment for body size.  The dose will be \n50 mg QD in the initial cohort.\nPatients will be successively assigned to the next available treatment slot within a dose level. \nEach dose cohort will initially include a minimum of 3 evaluable patients for assessment of \ntoxicity within the first cycle.  Dose escalation will occur in 100% increments until either of \nthe following occurrences: (1) drug related toxicity of Grade 2 severity occurs in 2 or more \npatients within a dose level; or (2) mean unbound AUC0-24 exceeds 2.4 \uf06dg\u00b7h/mL (the highest \nunbound AUC tested in the one-month toxicology studies).  Escalation increments will then \nbecome 40%.  In any cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be \nenrolled to that dose level.  If 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience a DLT, no further dose \nescalation will occur (see Figure 4).  Patients will continue treatment at their assigned dose \nlevel for at least 2 cycles to observe for cumulative toxicity.  They may then be treated at the \nnext higher dose level provided it has been shown to be safe in a previously treated cohort.\nIf the highest cohort being evaluated is closed to new enrollment, additional patients who \nhave a cytogenetic abnormality as described in Section 4.1 (Inclusion #1) may enter the \nstudy at the previous dose level.  These patients will not participate in the midazolam \nsub-study and will not have the Day -7 lead-in dose of PF-02341066 or any corresponding \nPK assessments.  They will be evaluated for safety but will not contribute to the MTD \nassessments.  These patients will enter the study on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Additionally, patients \nscheduled to enroll in the RP2D enriched population cohort (see RP2D Cohorts Section) \nmay be exempted from the Day -7 lead-in dose depending on the their overall medical \ncondition.  This exemption will be granted on a case-by-case basis as agreed upon by the \ninvestigator and Sponsor.  Upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #12, non-Asian patients \nwill also be exempt from the Day -7 lead-in dose.  Amendment #13 extends the requirements \nas described in the second paragraph of this section.  Upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment \n#16, Day -7 lead-in dose will only be required for the dose escalation cohort.\nDefinition of MTD\nThe MTD will be defined as the dose level at which at most one of six patients experience \nDLT after 28 days of treatment have occurred (end of Cycle 1) with the next higher dose \n",

Dose escalation \nmay be stopped if 1) MAD produces PF-02341066 concentrations that are at least 5-fold \ngreater than the projected target concentration, 2) exposure plateaus as the dose is increased \nand 3) MTD cannot be reached within a reasonable dose range (up to 2000 mg).\nMidazolam interaction sub-study\nThe potential for CYP3A inhibition due to PF-02341066 will be evaluated using MDZ as a \nCYP3A4 substrate probe at 3 dose levels of PF-02341066: the next higher dose after the \ninitial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D (see Figure 4).  The MDZ interaction study \nwill be conducted starting in the second dose cohort, and at a higher dose (ie, the predicted \nefficacious dose) in which the trough unbound plasma concentration of PF-02341066 at the \nsteady state will equal or exceed the projected target unbound plasma concentrations \n(12.8 nM).  If the target unbound plasma concentration of PF-02341066 is achieved in the \nsecond cohort, then the MDZ sub-study may not be performed with the higher dose cohort.  \nIn the second cohort or the efficacious dose cohort, at least 3 evaluable patients per cohort \nwill be assessed for the effect of repeat PF-02341066 administration on the \npharmacokinetics of midazolam.  If a significant change in MDZ clearance (>3-fold increase \nin MDZ AUC in all 3 patients, or >5-fold increase in 2 or more patients) is observed at any \nPF-02341066 dose level, further dose escalation may be terminated.\nThe effect of PF-02341066 on CYP3A activity will be evaluated at the RP2D.  Eight \nevaluable patients will be required for the MDZ interaction study in one of the RP2D cohorts \n(see RP2D Cohorts Section).  The results of the MDZ interaction sub-study at the RP2D will \nbe used to determine if there is any need for concomitant medication restrictions or dose \nmodifications in future PF-02341066 studies. \nPatients enrolled in the MDZ interaction sub-study will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of \nMDZ on Day \u20137 and another single 2-mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with PF-02341066 \non Cycle 2 Day 1 (morning dose if the BID regimen is employed).\nRifampin interaction sub-study: Refer to Appendix 6 for further details.\nItraconazole interaction sub-study: Refer to Appendix 7 for further details.\nRP2D cohorts\nThe RP2D will be determined as a dose below or equal to MTD, at which PF-02341066 is \nunlikely to cause an inhibition of CYP3A4 activity.  There will be two RP2D cohorts:\n1. The first RP2D cohort will evaluate drug-drug interactions. This includes the MDZ, \nrifampin and itraconazole interaction sub-studies noted above.  \na.

Three categories of NSCLC patients with MET amplification defined as: \n1) MET/CEP7 ratio of \uf0b35.0 (Group 1): As per the Protocol Administrative \nClarification Letter (PACL) dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-\noff for this group was revised to \u22654.0. As per the PACL dated 11 \nSeptember 2018, this group was closed to further enrollment. The \nremaining 14 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 \nalterations subgroup within the Enriched Other cohort.\n2) \uf04d\uf045\uf054\uf02fCEP7 ratio \uf03e2.2 to <5.0 (Group 2): As per the PACL dated 15 May \n2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-off for this group was revised to >2.2 to \n\uf03c4.0 and this group was closed to further enrollment. The remaining 13 \nenrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations \nsubgroup within the Enriched Other cohort;\n3) MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b31.8 to \uf0a32.2 (Group 3): As per the PACL dated 12 \nOctober 2015, this group was closed to further enrollment.  \nA total of 68 slots are planned for enrollment. As of IRB/EC approval of \nProtocol Amendment #24, enrollment is closed.

Approximately 171 patients with disease with molecular markers (other than \nALK marker positive NSCLC and ROS1 marker positive NSCLC) that may \nconfer sensitivity to PF-02341066 will be enrolled into the \u2018Enriched Other\u2019\ncohort. This cohort also includes NSCLC patients with tumors harboring \nMET Exon 14 alterations. Sponsor approval is required for enrollment into \nthis cohort.

As of the PACL dated 07 December \n2017, the remaining 13 open enrollment slots in the Enriched Other cohort \nwere assigned specifically to NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET \nExon 14 alterations rather than the broader Enriched Other cohort.  Thus, the \nEnriched Other cohort will be open only for enrollment of NSCLC patients \nwith MET Exon 14 alterations. As of the Investigator Communication Letter \ndated January 7, 2019, further enrollment of NSCLC patients with tumors \nharboring MET exon 14 alterations is closed.\nALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #1: \ne.\nThis cohort will consist of NSCLC patients who are negative for the ALK \ntranslocation as determined by the ALK break apart FISH assay used in \nProtocols A8081007 and A8081005.  A minimum of 25 to a maximum of \n50 evaluable patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed \nat the RP2D, ie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks.  \nEvery effort will be made to ensure that baseline characteristics for these \npatients are comparable to those of ALK marker positive patients enrolled in \nthe A8081007 trial.  In addition to encouraging ALK marker negative patients\nidentified under the A8081007 study to consider enrollment in the Phase 1 \ntrial, baseline characteristics for patients in the A8081007 study will be \nevaluated in a pooled fashion across treatment groups and enrollment of \npatients in the Phase 1 trial may be adjusted to reflect characteristics on \nspecific variables (eg, gender, age, etc).  However, upon agreement between \nthe Sponsor and Investigator, patients who have similar baseline \ncharacteristics to the ALK positive NSCLC patients in this study may be \nallowed to enter this study.  In order to increase comparability of response \nevaluation between ALK marker negative and ALK marker positive patients, \ntumor scans from ALK marker negative patients enrolled in this trial will be \nevaluated by an independent radiology group. As of the Note to File issued \n25 October 2012, tumor scans from patients enrolled into ALK marker \nnegative NSCLC Cohort #1 will no longer be collected for and submitted to \nan independent radiology laboratory for review. Enrollment is closed with \n47 patients treated.\nf.\nALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #2: This cohort will consist of NSCLC \npatients who are negative for the ALK translocation as determined by the ALK \nbreak apart FISH assay by the central laboratory selected by the Sponsor.  At \nleast 20 patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed at the \nRP2D, ie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks.  \nPatients may have been pre-screened using a local ALK test.  However, only \npatients whose pre-screening ALK test was negative and confirmed negative \nby the central laboratory selected by the Sponsor may be enrolled in this trial.  \nNo molecular testing for MET or ROS1 may be performed prior to patient \nenrollment.  As of the Note to File dated 19 June 2012, the requirement that \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 66\nno molecular testing for MET or ROS1 to occur prior to patient enrollment \nwas removed.  Thus, MET or ROS1 testing may have been performed prior to \npatient entry into this cohort.  However if the test result is either MET or \nROS1 positive, then the patient cannot be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients \nshould, however, have sufficient tumor tissue, ie, 9 slides, if possible, each \ncontaining unstained tissue sections that are 5 microns thick, to be tested for \nROS1 fusion, MET amplification \n \n  The Sponsor will provide tumor shipment \ninstructions for ROS1 and MET testing under separate cover.  Enrollment is \nclosed with 21 patients treated.  Further detail for the ALK marker negative \nNSCLC Cohort #2 is provided in Appendix 8.\nIn addition, if possible, up to 6 patients will undergo pre- and post-dose [18F]-FLT-PET.  \nAlso, if possible, the same patients who have biopsies performed, will undergo \n[18F]-FLT-PET.  A separate sub-study with at least 6 evaluable patients with MET mutation \nor amplification will undergo pre- and post-dose [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET.  With \nthe approval of Amendment #13 by the IRB/EC, no additional patients will undergo PET \nimaging.  Finally, 12 evaluable patients in this cohort will participate in a fed/fast sub-study \n(see below). Clinical sites in Korea will not participate in this sub-study.  Depending upon \nthe overall results from the RP2D cohorts, a different dose/schedule may be tested in \nadditional cohorts.\nFor patients who participate in the fed/fast sub-study, the effect of a high-fat, high-calorie \nbreakfast on PF-02341066 pharmacokinetics will be studied.  Each patient will serve as their \nown control in which PF-02341066 is administered under either \u201cfed\u201d or \u201cfasted\u201d \nconditions on Day -7 and Day 1 of Cycle 1 (morning dose if the BID regimen is employed).  \nPharmacokinetic sampling times are described in Section 7.5.1.1.  The testing order for fed \nversus fasted conditions will be as follows: the first 6 patients to participate in this sub-study \nwill be tested under fed followed by fasted conditions, the next 6 patients will be tested under \nfasted followed by fed conditions.  If patients are receiving PF-02341066 on a BID dosing \nschedule, the evening dose of Day 1 of Cycle 1 will be cancelled.  Patients who have had a \ngastrectomy or have dietary restrictions or adverse events that preclude a 10-hour overnight \nfast or cannot consume the high-fat, high-calorie meal will not be required to participate in\nthis sub-study.  See Section 5.2.3.1 for additional details on the high-fat, high-calorie meal.\nAll tumor scans from ALK marker positive NSCLC patients enrolled in the enriched\npopulation cohort (including ALK marker positive NSCLC patients in the dose escalation \ncohort) will be evaluated by an independent radiology group.

All intrapatient dose reductions are relative to the next \nlowest dose of the current cycle (dose level).  Dose reduction of the regimen will be \ndependent on the attribution of toxicity as PF-02341066-related or possibly related to \nPF-02341066.  The investigator (in discussion with the Sponsor) has discretion as to whether \nto discontinue or modify the dosages of the study drug, depending on the severity and timing \nof the event(s).  A maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed per patient.\nFor patients enrolled in the RP2D cohorts, intrapatient dose reduction is permitted at any \ntime.  Following IRB/EC approval of Amendment #16, dose level -1 is 200 mg BID and dose \nlevel -2 is 250 mg QD.  A maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed per patient.\nInvestigators are encouraged to employ best supportive care according to local institutional \nclinical practices and according to the guidance for selected adverse events provided below.\n5.1. Management of Selected PF-02341066-Related Adverse Events\n5.1.1. Nausea and Emesis\nFor nausea and emesis, treat with standard anti-emetics such as prochlorperazine or \nondansetron.  Taking the medication with food may reduce nausea.  Prophylactic antiemetics\nshould be considered. \n5.1.2. Diarrhea\nFor CTCAE Grade 1 diarrhea, symptomatic care such as loperamide (Imodium\uf0d2) or no \nintervention at investigator judgment. \nFor CTCAE Grade 2 diarrhea, loperamide (4 mg at first onset, then 2 mg every 2-4 hours \nuntil symptom free for 12 hours).  No dose modification unless patient is intolerant or \nsymptom is recurrent. \nFor CTCAE Grade \uf0b33 (despite use of loperamide), treatment should be withheld until \nrecovery to Grade \uf0a31.\n5.1.3. Bradycardia\nConcurrent use of PF-02341066 with other bradycardic agents (eg, beta-blockers, \nnon-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem, clonidine, \ndigoxin) should be avoided to the extent possible, due to the increased risk of symptomatic \nbradycardia. \nHeart rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly.  Dose modification is not \nrequired in cases of asymptomatic bradycardia.  For management of patients who develop \nsymptomatic bradycardia, see Table 2b.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 69\nIt is important to counsel patients about the risk of bradycardia and inform them of what \nsymptoms and signs to be aware of and actions to take.\n5.1.4. Pneumonitis\nInvestigators must evaluate thoroughly patients who demonstrate potential signs /symptoms \nof pneumonitis.  If a patient has a potential diagnosis of pneumonitis or drug related lung \ninjury, the following evaluations/procedures should be considered to assist or exclude the \ndiagnosis of pneumonitis during this period in the absence of disease progression, other \npulmonary disease, infection or radiation effects:\n\u2022\nA sputum gram stain and culture (induced sputum if needed) bacterial, viral, fungal, \nprotozoal, and mycobacterial pathogens;  \n\u2022\nBlood culture should be performed in febrile patients.  Consider appropriate \nserologies (mycoplasma, legionella, CMV, other viruses, etc.);\n\u2022\nThoracentesis if pleural fluid is present (culture, microbiology, cytology);\n\u2022\nBronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) if appropriate. The BAL fluid \nshould be sent for culture, microbiology and cytology;\n\u2022\nA plasma sample for BNP (B-type Natriuretic peptide) to evaluate for evidence of \nCHF;\n\u2022\nFor Asian patients, a blood sample for \u03b2-D-glucan to evaluate for the presence of \nfungal pneumonia (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii).\nIf clinically appropriate, high dose corticosteroid treatment should be initiated. \nShould the event be fatal an autopsy is highly recommended to confirm/exclude the \ndiagnosis. \nFor any case of drug-related pneumonitis, discontinue PF-02341066 and contact the Sponsor \n(see Table 2b).\n5.1.5. Renal Cyst\nThe development of complex renal cysts has been reported in some patients with NSCLC \ntreated with PF-02341066.  These cysts may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and have \nusually developed within the first several months of starting PF-02341066.  The precise \nnature and significance of these cysts is unclear; however, while no evidence of malignancy \nhas been found based on aspiration of cyst fluid and biopsy in the reported cases, complex \nrenal cysts may be associated with renal malignancy, and thus consultation with a urologist \nor suitable alternate medical expert is recommended.  Active surveillance with appropriate \nimaging (contrast-enhanced CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging) should be \nCCI\n",

After IRB/EC approval of Protocol Amendment #17, only NSCLC patients will be evaluated for \nadditional specialized ophthalmological testing which includes: refractive error, pupil size, fundus photography, optical coherence \ntomography and intraocular pressure.  These additional tests will be performed at screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, 1 year and \nyearly thereafter and then at 2 to 8 weeks after discontinuation of PF-02341066.  For all other patients, applicable ophthalmologic \nexaminations should be repeated during the study whenever a vision disorder AE is observed or when there is an increase in CTCAE grade \nfrom the previous visit.  As of the Note To File issued 18 March 2016, the following ophthalmologic tests (added in Protocol Amendment \n#17) are no longer required for NSCLC patients: refractive error, pupil size, intraocular pressure, ocular coherence tomography, dilated \nfundus photography.  See Section 7.3.\nEvery effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.\nIn the event of significant toxicity, dosing may be interrupted and/or reduced as described \nbelow.  In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst \ntoxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify their investigators at the first \noccurrence of any adverse event.  \nDose modifications may occur in 2 ways:\n\uf0b7\nWithin a cycle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and dose reduction, if \nrequired, during a given treatment cycle; \n\uf0b7\nIn the next cycle: dose reduction may be required in a subsequent cycle based on \ntoxicity experienced in the previous cycle.\nDose Interruption\nThe study investigator may implement dose suspension and/or reduction in order to ensure \npatient safety; however interruption in treatment should last for no more than 6 weeks.  If a \nlonger interruption is required, discussion with the Sponsor must occur and agreement must \nbe reached between both the Sponsor and Investigator.\nDose Re-Escalation\nDoses reduced for drug-related toxicity should generally not be re-escalated.  However, \nintrapatient re-escalation back one or two dose levels after at least 4 weeks of treatment at the \nreduced dose level may be permitted on a case-by-case basis depending on the clinical setting \nand assessment of risk/benefit ratio after discussion with the Sponsor.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 74\nOverdose Instructions\nIn the event of an overdose, the Sponsor should be contacted to discuss the details of the \noverdose and formulate a clinical management plan. \nNo information regarding overdose of PF-02341066 in humans is available.  No antidote \nexists for the treatment of PF-02341066 overdose.  In the event of an accidental overdose, the \npatient should be monitored for possible signs of toxicity as mentioned above.  As there is no \nspecific antidote for overdose of PF-02341066, general supportive care should be provided. \n5.2. Drug Supplies\n5.2.1. Formulation and Packaging\n5.2.1.1. PF-02341066\nPrior to IRB/EC approval of Amendment #12:\nPF-02341066 is filled in two tone gray capsules containing 10, 50 or 100 mg of study \nmedication for oral administration.  The drug product consists of PF-02341066 in a hard \ngelatin capsule.  The capsules are packaged in HDPE bottles and should be stored at room \ntemperature (15 to 25\uf0b0C) and handled with care.\nFollowing IRB/EC approval of Amendment #12:\nPF-02341066 will also be provided as tablets containing 50 or 100 mg of study drug for oral \nadministration.  The 50 mg tablets are round in shape whereas the 100 mg tablets are oval in \nshape.  The tablets are packaged in HDPE bottles and should be stored at 15 to 30\uf0b0C and \nhandled with care.  PF-02341066 may also be supplied as an oral solution (25 mg/mL) upon \nSponsor agreement and availability of supplies.  The oral solution is buffered, sweetened, and \ngrape-flavored and is packaged in HDPE bottles.  Dosing instructions and storage conditions \nfor the oral solution will be provided under separate cover.\nFollowing IRB/EC approval of Amendment #25 (Japan specific amendment): \nPF-02341066 formulated capsules can also be administered. This capsule formulation has \nbeen shown to be bioequivalent to the tablets and a powder in capsule (PIC). Two capsule \ndosage strengths will be used: 200 mg and 250 mg of PF-02341066 for oral administration.\nThe capsules are packaged in HDPE bottles, should be stored at 1 to 30\uf0b0C and handled with \ncare.\n5.2.1.2. Midazolam (MDZ)\nMDZ syrup (2 mg/mL) for oral administration will be used for patients who will participate \nin the MDZ interaction sub-study.  The drug name and lot number for MDZ should be \nrecorded in Case Report Forms (CRFs).\n5.2.1.3. Rifampin\nSee Appendix 6 for details.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 75\n5.2.1.4. Itraconazole\nSee Appendix 7 for details.\n5.2.2. Preparation and Dispensing\n5.2.2.1. PF-02341066\nThe study medication should be dispensed according to the schedule of treatment \nadministration (Section 5.2.3). Dispensing will be done by a qualified staff member in \nbottles provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule.  The patient/caregiver \nshould be instructed to maintain the product in the bottle provided throughout the course of\ndosing and return the bottle to the site at the next study visit. \nOnly qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to \nthem and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of \nPF-02341066.\nMedication will be provided in bulk containers.  Investigational sites will also be provided \nwith a supply of bottles and non-patient-specific labels.  Site personnel must ensure that \npatients clearly understand the directions for self-medication. Patients should be given \nsufficient supply to last until their next study visit, ie, supplies for one cycle, however; for \npatients who visit the clinic every 2 cycles (after completing 10 cycles), enough supply for \n2 cycles will be provided.\nOnce Amendment #12 is approved by the IRB/EC, all newly enrolled patients will receive \ntablet supplies.  For ongoing patients, tablets will be supplied gradually and eventually \ncompletely replace the capsule.\nPF-02341066 is a cytotoxic agent that must be handled and administered with care.  Patients \nshould be instructed to keep their medication in the bottles provided and not transfer it to any\nother container.  Due to possible unknown hazards associated with topical and \nenvironmental exposure to experimental cytotoxic agents, capsules must not be opened \nand/or emptied into any vehicle for oral ingestion. Capsules or tablets must be swallowed \nintact.  However, PF-02341066 tablets may be dissolved according to specific dosing \ninstructions which will be provided under separate cover after Sponsor approval is granted.  \nAdministration of PF-02341066 through any other means besides orally is not permitted.\nTherefore, if a patient is unable to swallow the study drug intact, then 2 options exist:\n\uf0b7\nWhen available, PF-02341066 may be supplied as an oral solution (25 mg/mL) as \ndescribed in Section 5.2.1.1, or\n\uf0b7\nPF-02341066 tablets may be dissolved according to specific dosing instructions as \nnoted above.\nIn either circumstance, prior approval must be obtained from the Sponsor, and thereafter,\ndosing instructions will be provided under separate cover.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 76\nNote: For patients enrolled in rifampin and itraconazole interaction sub-studies, only the \ntablet formulation of PF-02341066 will be administered from the first dose of PF-02341066 \nuntil the last dose of PF-02341066 when co-administered with rifampin or itraconazole.  \nRefer to Appendix 6 and Appendix 7 for further details.\n5.2.2.2. MDZ\nMidazolam will be dispensed using the manufacturer specified dispensing instructions.  \nQualified personnel will prepare and dispense the MDZ dose in accordance with the current \npackage insert. \n5.2.3. Administration\n5.2.3.1. PF-02341066\nAdministration will be performed on an outpatient basis.  PF-02341066 should be taken with \nat least 8 oz. of water on an empty stomach, ie, patient should refrain from food and \nbeverages (except water) for at least 2 hours prior to dosing and for at least 2 hours after \ndosing.  However, starting on Day 2 of Cycle 2, patients may take PF-02341066 without \nregard to meals.  With the approval of Amendment #14, patients may take PF-02341066 \nwithout regards to meals upon the initiation of treatment unless otherwise indicated.  Patients \nshould be instructed to take their medication at approximately the same time each day and to \nnot take more than the prescribed dose at any time.  However, a variance of up to 12 hours \nfor QD dosing and 6 hours for BID dosing either way is allowed for any given dose, rather \nthan miss a day\u2019s dose.  If a patient misses a day\u2019s dose entirely, they must be instructed not \nto \u201cmake it up\u201d the next day.  If a patient vomits anytime after taking a dose, they must be \ninstructed not to \u201cmake it up,\u201d but to resume subsequent doses the next day as prescribed.  If\na patient inadvertently takes 1 extra dose during a day, the patient should not take the next \ndose of PF-02341066.  Patients should also be instructed to swallow the trial medication \nwhole and not chew the capsule or tablet prior to swallowing.  No capsule or tablet should be \ningested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact.  Doses may be modified according to \nTable 2.  The study investigator may implement dose suspension and/or reduction in order to \nensure patient safety.\nFor patients participating in the food effect study, PF-02341066 will be administered \nfollowing an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.  For those patients scheduled to receive the \n\u201cfed\u201d treatment, a high-fat, high-caloric breakfast will be provided and must be consumed \nover 30 minutes.  PF-02341066 will be administered with approximately 8 oz of water \n30 minutes after the start of the meal.  No additional food will be allowed until at least \n2 hours post-dose.  For patients scheduled to receive the \u201cfasted\u201d treatment, PF-02341066 \nwill be administered with 8 oz of water.  No food will be allowed for an additional 2 hours \npost-dose.  For either treatment day, water will be allowed ad libitum.  A high-fat \n(approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal) and high-calorie (approximately \n800-1000 calories) meal is recommended as a test meal.  This test meal should derive\napproximately 150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, \nrespectively.  An example test meal would be two eggs fried in butter, two strips of bacon \n(may be replaced with ham or cheese of similar caloric content), two slices of toast with \nbutter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes and eight ounces of whole-fat milk.  However, it \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 77\nis understood that some patients may not be able to consume the entire meal. Study staff \nshould record the % of the standard breakfast that is consumed.\n5.2.3.2. MDZ \nIn the MDZ interaction sub-study, patients will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on \nDay -7 and will receive another single 2-mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with \nPF-02341066 on Cycle 2 Day 1. \nPatients should refrain from food and beverages (except water) 8 hours prior to MDZ dosing \nand 2 hours after dosing.  Qualified personnel will administer MDZ syrup (1 mL to provide \n2 mg of MDZ) using an oral disposable syringe followed by 8 oz. of ambient temperature \nwater.  Additionally, to standardize conditions for PK sampling, patients should refrain from \nlying down (except as needed for vital sign and ECG assessments) in the 2-hour period \nfollowing MDZ administration.\n5.2.3.3. Rifampin\nPlease see Appendix 6 for details.\n5.2.3.4. Itraconazole\nPlease see Appendix 7 for details.\n5.2.4. Patient Compliance\nPatients will be required to return all bottles of study drug at the beginning of each cycle.  \nThe number of capsules or tablets remaining will be documented and recorded.  Patients who\nare considered non-compliant will be withdrawn from study (see Section 6.1).\nAs of the Note to File (NTF) dated 08 February 2018, the following guidance was issued to \nsites regarding dosing compliance:\nStudy Treatment (Crizotinib) Dosing\nReport as\nProtocol Deviation\nReport as\nMedication Error\nPatient unintentionally misses a total of < 20% \nof his/her doses within a given cycle \nNo\nNo\nPatient unintentionally misses a total of \u226520% \nof his/her doses within a given cycle\nYes\nYes\nPatient unintentionally takes 1 extra dose \nwithin a given cycle\nYes\nNo\nPatient unintentionally takes >1 extra dose with \na given cycle\nYes\nYes\nPlease note, unintentional missed or extra doses should be investigated further with the \npatient to determine other potential reasons for the missed or extra doses (ie, whether due to a \npossible adverse event), as well as how to minimize their reoccurrence\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 78\n5.3. Drug Storage \nThe investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all study \ndrugs, ie, PF-02341066, rifampin and itraconazole, are stored in a secured area with \ncontrolled access under recommended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable \nregulatory requirements.\nPF-02341066 should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the drug label.  \nSee the Investigator\u2019s Brochure for storage conditions of the product.\nStorage conditions stated in the single reference safety document (Investigator\u2019s Brochure) \nwill be superseded by the storage conditions stated in the labeling.\nReturned medication for PF-02341066 should be stored separately from medication that \nneeds to be dispensed.  \nSite systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a \nminimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as \napplicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products). This should be \ncaptured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study.  Even for \ncontinuous monitoring systems, a log or site procedure which ensures active daily evaluation \nfor excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum \ntemperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last \nevaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum \ntemperature for all non-working days upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the \ntemperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, \nshould be regularly inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order.  \nAny excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor \nupon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the \nstorage conditions as described in the labelling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the \nstorage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the \nSponsor. Once an excursion is identified, PF-02341066 must be quarantined and not used \nuntil the Sponsor provides documentation of permission to use it.  It will not be considered a \nprotocol deviation if the Sponsor approves the use of the investigational product after the \ntemperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to Sponsor approval will be \nconsidered a protocol deviation.\nSpecific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be \nprovided to the site. \nReceipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where \nthe product(s) are briefly out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not \nconsidered excursions. More specific details will be provided to the sites separately.\nSite staff will instruct patients on the proper storage requirements for take home medications.\nIf an excursion is identified for itraconazole, the Sponsor should be contacted.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 79\nThe investigational product manual should be referenced for any additional guidance on \nstorage conditions and actions to be taken when conditions are outside the specified range.\nThe above requirements are to be implemented upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21 if \nnot previously implemented.\nCapsules: PF-02341066 investigational medication should be stored at 15-25\uf0b0C (room \ntemperature).  Medication should be kept in a secured locked area at the study site in \naccordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  Patients should be instructed to keep \ntheir medication in its original container and stored at 15-25\uf0b0C (room temperature).  \nReturned medication should be stored separately from medication that needs to be dispensed.\n200 mg and 250 mg Formulated Capsules (Japan specific amendment): PF-02341066 \ninvestigational medication should be stored at 1-30\uf0b0C. Medication should be kept in a \nsecured locked area at the study site in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  \nPatients should be instructed to keep their medication in its original container and stored at \n1-30\uf0b0C.  Returned medication should be stored separately from medication that needs to be \ndispensed.\nTablets: PF-02341066 investigational medication should be stored at 15-30\uf0b0C.  Medication \nshould be kept in a secured locked area at the study site in accordance with applicable \nregulatory requirements.  Patients should be instructed to keep their medication in its original \ncontainer and stored at 15-30\uf0b0C.  Returned medication should be stored separately from \nmedication that needs to be dispensed.\nOral Solution: In those cases when an oral solution is approved for use by the Sponsor, \ndetailed instructions on storage will be provided under separate cover.\nTo ensure adequate records, all study drug will be accounted for in the CRF and drug \naccountability inventory forms as instructed by the Sponsor.  Unless otherwise authorized, at \nthe end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the patients must be \nreturned to the Sponsor or its designee.  Patients must return all containers to a designated \nstudy center participant.  All containers of PF-02341066 that were sent to the investigator \nthroughout the study must be returned to the Sponsor or designee, whether they are used or \nunused, and whether they are empty or contain capsules.\n5.4. Drug Accountability \nThe investigator\u2019s site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or \nother disposition of the drug supplies.  \nTo ensure adequate records, all study drugs will be accounted for in a drug accountability \ninventory form/record as instructed by the Sponsor.  Unless otherwise authorized by the \nSponsor, all PF-02341066 supplies unallocated or unused by the patients must be destroyed \nby procedures approved by the Sponsor or returned to the Sponsor or its designee.

Concomitant Radiotherapy or Surgery\nPalliative radiotherapy to specific sites of disease is permitted if considered medically \nnecessary by the treating physician.  PF-02341066 treatment should be interrupted during \npalliative radiotherapy \u2013 stopping 1 day before and resuming treatment 1 day after.  \nIrradiated lesions will be considered not evaluable for response but still can be used to assess \ndisease progression.  The intensities, number, and dates of doses received for allowed \npalliative radiotherapy should be recorded on the appropriate CRFs. \nThe effect of PF-02341066 on wound healing is not known and has not been investigated; \ntherefore, caution is still advised on theoretical grounds (potential antiangiogenic effect) for \nany surgical procedures during the study.  The appropriate interval of time between surgery\nand PF-02341066 required to minimize the risk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has\nnot been determined.  In the event elective surgery is necessary during study participation, \nPF-02341066 dosing should be stopped 48 hours before surgery and resumed no sooner than \n48 hours after surgery.  Postoperatively, the decision to reinitiate PF-02341066 treatment \nshould be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound healing and recovery from \nsurgery.\n6.

Following IRB/EC approval of Amendment #18, patients in the RP2D \nMET-amplified NSCLC and Enriched Other cohorts and ALK marker negative NSCLC \nRP2D Cohort #2 will have PK samples collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 and 5 at pre-dose \n(0 hour) and 2-6 hours post-dose.  In addition, for patients in the MET-amplified NSCLC, \nROS1 marker positive NSCLC and Enriched Other cohorts, a PK sample should be taken \naround the time that disease progression is confirmed as long as the patient is still on \nPF-02341066 treatment.  \nFurther details for the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort #2 are provided in Appendix 8.\nFurther details for the MET-amplified NSCLC Cohort are provided in Appendix 9.\nFurther details for the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort are provided in Appendix 10.\nFurther details for the Enriched Other cohort are provided in Appendix 11. \nIn addition to samples mentioned above, additional blood samples for PK evaluation may be \nrequested from patients experiencing unexpected or serious adverse events; with evidence of \ndisease progression; or with other events where PK sampling is considered useful (upon \nagreement between investigator and Sponsor).  More than one PK sample per patient may be \ncollected throughout the study; however the total blood volume of additional PK samples \ncollected per patient should not exceed 15 mL (ie, no more than 5, 3 mL samples). As of \nIRB/EC approval of Protocol Amendment #23, the total blood volume of additional PK \nsamples collected per patient should not exceed 20 mL (ie, no more than 5, 4 mL samples).\nBlood samples (4 mL) for PF-02341066 pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected into \nappropriately labeled collection tubes containing KEDTA at protocol-specified times.  Once \ncollected, samples should be processed immediately and kept out of direct sunlight due to the \nlight sensitive nature of PF-02341066.  Blood samples will be placed immediately on \nice-bath and centrifuged at approximately 1700 g for 10 minutes at 4\uf0b0C.  Plasma samples \nwill be stored in appropriately labeled tubes at approximately -20\u00b0C within 1 hour of \ncollection.

Urine for Analysis of PF-02341066\nIn the RP2D midazolam interaction cohort, urine samples will be collected for 24 hours after \nPF-02341066 dosing on Cycle 1 Day 15 to measure PF-02341066 concentrations, and \nthereby determine the renal elimination of PF-02341066 from the body.  Metabolites of \nPF-02341066 may also be measured in the urine samples.  Urine will be collected on Cycle 1 \nDay 15 over the following intervals: 0 to 4 hours, 4 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours postdose.  \nPatients will empty their bladder just prior to dosing on Cycle 1 Day 15. \nAt the end of each urine collection period, the total volume will be measured and recorded.  \nVoided urine should be collected in an amber container and protected from direct light.  The\nurine will then be mixed thoroughly and a 20 mL aliquot will be withdrawn for the potential \nmeasurement of drug concentrations.  The sample will be protected from light and frozen at \napproximately -20\u00b0C. \n7.5.3. Plasma for PF-02341066 Metabolite Profiling\nAdditional 5-mL blood samples will be collected at 4-8 hours post dose on Cycle 1 Day 15 in \nthe RP2D midazolam interaction cohort for metabolite profiling.\nDetail collection procedure will be provided in the study manual.\n7.5.4. Blood Sample for Pharmacogenomics\nBlood samples for genotyping will be examined to assess the impact of allelic variants of \ndrug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters.  Additionally, these samples may also be used \nfor retrospective evaluation of additional genetic variants associated with variation in \npharmacokinetics (PKs) or to explore the relationship with AEs.  Samples will be retained \nfor a period of up to 3 years following the submission of the final clinical study report (CSR).\nA 4-mL blood sample will be collected from each subject into a plastic dipotassium \nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA) tube at times specified in the SCHEDULE OF \nACTIVITIES section of the protocol.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 92\n \n \nThe pharmacogenomic (PGx) samples must be processed and shipped as indicated in the \ninstructions provided to the investigator site to maintain sample integrity. Any deviations \nfrom the PGx processing steps, including any actions taken, must be documented and \nreported to the Sponsor. On a case-by-case basis, the Sponsor may make a determination as \nto whether sample integrity has been compromised. Any sample deemed outside of \nestablished stability, or of questionable integrity, will be considered a protocol deviation.\nFor patients enrolled in clinical sites in Japan as part of the Enriched Other Cohort, blood \nsample collection for pharmacogenomics is optional.\n7.5.5. Urine Sample for 6 beta-Hydroxycortisol/Cortisol (6\u03b2-OHC/C) Ratio \nA midstream morning spot urine sample (10 mL) will be collected into an appropriately \nlabelled plastic screw topped collection container prior to dosing of any drug on Day 1 of \nCycle 1, Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycle 2.  Urine samples should be frozen \nimmediately and stored at -20\u00b0C.

[18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET Imaging (RP2D enriched population cohort \nonly)\nIf possible, at least 6 evaluable patients with MET mutations/amplification will be enrolled \ninto the imaging portion of the RP2D enriched population cohort.  These patients will \nundergo [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET imaging. Also, if possible, the same patients \nthat have pre- and post-dose biopsies will undergo PET imaging. The screening\n[18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET will be used to determine evaluable index lesions for \neach patient. Tumor background ratios (TBR) and development of new sites of abnormality \nwill be recorded.  A patient will be considered evaluable if they have 2 or more baseline \ntarget lesions each identified by both [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET imaging.  All \nevaluable lesions must have a baseline [18F]-FLT-PET SUV of at least 2, and a baseline \n[18F]-FDG-PET SUV \u22653.5 (liver) or \u22655 (non-liver). Results of the PET sub-study will be \nscored according to the methods developed by the American College of Radiology Imaging \nNetwork (ACRIN; http://www.acrin.org/petcorelab.html).

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal \nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following \nsections. \nFor all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to \ndetermine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for \nclassification as a serious adverse event (SAE) (see Section 8.6) requiring immediate \nnotification to Pfizer or its designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient \ninformation should be obtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the adverse \nevent.  The investigator is required to assess causality.  Follow-up by the investigator may be\nrequired until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the \ninvestigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event \nthat is determined by the Sponsor to be serious will be reported by the Sponsor as an SAE.  \nTo assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from \nthe investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical \nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begin from the \ntime that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient\u2019s \nparticipation in the clinical trial, ie, prior to undergoing any trial-related procedure and/or \nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last \nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the \ninvestigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the \ninvestigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational \nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAdverse events (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF)\nfrom the time the patient has taken at least one dose of investigational product through the \npatient\u2019s last visit.\nIf a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period for \nnon-serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be \nreported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last dose of \ninvestigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient \nadministered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\nrelationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of adverse events include but are not \nlimited to:  \n\uf0b7\nAbnormal test findings;\n\uf0b7\nClinically significant symptoms and signs;\n\uf0b7\nChanges in physical examination findings;\n\uf0b7\nHypersensitivity;\n\uf0b7\nDrug abuse;\n\uf0b7\nDrug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\n\uf0b7\nDrug overdose;\n\uf0b7\nDrug withdrawal;\n\uf0b7\nDrug misuse;\n\uf0b7\nDrug interactions;\n\uf0b7\nExtravasation;\n\uf0b7\nExposure during pregnancy (EDP);\n\uf0b7\nExposure via breastfeeding;\n\uf0b7\nMedication error;\n\uf0b7\nOccupational exposure;\n\uf0b7\nWorsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under trial should be reported as\nadverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed \nby measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be \nreported as adverse events.\n8.4. Medication Errors\nMedication errors may result, in this study, from the administration or consumption of the \nwrong product, by the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  \nSuch medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication \nerror case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page, and \non the SAE form when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the Sponsor\nshould be notified immediately.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 96\nMedication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, \nincluding:\n\uf0b7\nMedication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product;\n\uf0b7\nPotential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do \nor do not involve the participating patient.\nWhether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the \ninvestigator, the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the adverse \nevent (AE) page and, if applicable, any associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.\n8.5. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as \nan adverse event are as follows: \n\uf0b7\nTest result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, \nand/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result leads to a change in trial dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose \nadjustments) or discontinuation from the trial, significant additional concomitant drug\ntreatment, or other therapy, and/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result is considered to be an adverse event by the investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not \nconstitute an adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does \nnot require reporting as an adverse event.\n8.6. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:\n\uf0b7\nResults in death;\n\uf0b7\nIs life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n\uf0b7\nRequires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n\uf0b7\nResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the \nability to conduct normal life functions);\n\uf0b7\nResults in congenital anomaly/birth defect.\n\uf0b7\nProgression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of \nprogression) should not be reported as serious adverse events unless the outcome is \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 97\nfatal within the safety reporting period.  Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of \ndisease progression should not be reported as a serious adverse event.  If the \nmalignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the safety reporting period, \nthen the event leading to death must be recorded as an adverse event and as a serious \nadverse event with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)\nGrade 5 (see the section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important \nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or \nresult in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize \nthe patient, or may require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse event outcomes, \nthe important medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for \nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; \nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.6.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events \nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported by the \ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements). \n8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria \noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of \ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy\u2019s Law cases) and should always be considered \nimportant medical events.\nThe threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury \ndepends on the patient\u2019s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Patients who \npresent with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to \ndefinitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:\n\uf0b7\nPatients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range\nwho subsequently present with AST or ALT values \uf0b33 times the upper limit of \nnormal (x ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value \uf0b32 x ULN with no evidence of \nhemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value \uf0a32 x ULN or not available. \n\uf0b7\nFor patients with pre-existing AST OR ALT OR total bilirubin values above the \nupper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition \nmentioned above:\n\uf0b7\nFor patients with preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal \nrange; AST or ALT values \uf0b32 times the baseline values and \uf0b33 x ULN, or\n\uf0b38 x ULN (whichever is smaller).\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 98\n\uf0b7\nConcurrent with\n\uf0b7\nFor patients with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: \nTotal bilirubin level increased from baseline by an amount of at least 1 x ULN \nor if the value reaches \uf0b33 x ULN (whichever is smaller).\nThe patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, \npreferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should \ninclude laboratory tests, a detailed history and physical assessment.  The possibility of \nhepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered.  In addition to repeating \nmeasurements of AST and ALT and total bilirubin, laboratory tests should also include \nalbumin, creatine kinase, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), \nprothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, alkaline \nphosphatase and acetaminophen and/or protein adduct levels.  A detailed history, including \nrelevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and \nsupplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel \nhistory, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver \nor allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute \nhepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted.  All \ncases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no \nother cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be \nconsidered potential Hy\u2019s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the \ninvestigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy\u2019s \nLaw cases should be reported as serious adverse events.\n8.7. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or \nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also \nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric \nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a \ntuberculosis unit).  An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; \nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical \nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n\uf0b7\nRehabilitation facilities;\n\uf0b7\nHospice facilities;\n\uf0b7\nRespite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n\uf0b7\nSkilled nursing facilities;\n\uf0b7\nNursing homes;\n\uf0b7\nSame day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical \nadverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include: \n\uf0b7\nAdmission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the \ndevelopment of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition \n(eg, for work-up of persistent pre-treatment lab abnormality);\n\uf0b7\nSocial admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);\n\uf0b7\nAdministrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);\n\uf0b7\nProtocol-specified admission during a clinical trial (eg, for a procedure required by \nthe trial protocol);\n\uf0b7\nOptional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical adverse event (eg, for \nelective cosmetic surgery);\n\uf0b7\nHospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n\uf0b7\nPre-planned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline \ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n\uf0b7\nAdmission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not \nbe reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was \nperformed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an \nacute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as \nthe adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the \nadverse event.\n8.8. Severity Assessment\nIf required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the following \ndefinitions of severity in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 to describe the maximum intensity of the \nadverse event.  If the event is serious, the CTCAE grade reported in the adverse event CRF \nmust be consistent with the description of CTCAE grade included in the narrative section of \nthe serious adverse event report. \nGRADE\nClinical Description of Severity\n0\nNo Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in \nthe Version 3.0 CTCAE document but may be used in certain \ncircumstances.)\n1\nMILD Adverse Event\n2\nMODERATE Adverse Event\n3\nSEVERE Adverse Event\n4\nLIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 100\n5\nDEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe \nevent is not necessarily a serious adverse event.  For example, a headache may be severe \n(interferes significantly with patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious \nunless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.\n8.9. Causality Assessment\nThe investigator\u2019s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events (serious \nand non-serious): the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as \nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting \nrequirements, if applicable.  An investigator\u2019s causality assessment is the determination of \nwhether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or \ncontributed to an adverse event; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a \ncausal relationship should be provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not \ninvestigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as \u201crelated to \ninvestigational product\u201d for reporting purposes as defined by the Sponsor (see the section on \nReporting Requirements).  If the investigator's causality assessment is \u201cunknown but not \nrelated to investigational product\u201d, this should be clearly documented on trial records.\nIn addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with trial \nprocedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and \nCRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse \nevent reporting requirements, if applicable.\n8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during \npregnancy occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been \nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational \nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or \nbeing exposed to the investigational product;\nAn example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with \na Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has \nbeen exposed to chemotherapeutic products).\n2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the \ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed \nduring his partner\u2019s pregnancy.\nIf any trial patient or trial patient\u2019s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the trial \npatient\u2019s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this \ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form \nand Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE \nhas occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 101\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant \nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EDP \nsupplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred \nand within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include \nthe anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of \npregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for\nall EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up \nto the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the \nneonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for \ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the \nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test \nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for a serious adverse event (ie, ectopic \npregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital \nanomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal \ndeath]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as serious adverse events \nfollows: \n\uf0b7\n\u201cSpontaneous abortion\u201d includes miscarriage and missed abortion.\n\uf0b7\nNeonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard \nto causality, as serious adverse events.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should \nbe reported as serious adverse events when the investigator assesses the infant death \nas related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the \ninvestigator.  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis \n(eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal \nexposure, the investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source \ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to \nprovide to his partner.\n8.11. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person \n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the \nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the \ninvestigator\u2019s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an \nassociated AE/SAE.

Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also the Section on Patient Withdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to adverse events should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other \ncauses, according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the \nappropriate adverse event CRF page. \nWhen a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the serious adverse event must be reported in \naccordance with the reporting requirements defined below.\n8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events \nspontaneously reported by the trial patient.  In addition, each trial patient will be questioned \nabout adverse events.\n8.14. Reporting Requirements\nEach adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse \nevent.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and \ninternational regulations, as appropriate.\n8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf a serious adverse event occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator \nawareness of the event. \nIn particular, if the serious adverse event is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer \nmust be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information.  \nThis timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously\nforwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of \nexposure during pregnancy, exposure via breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious \nadverse event immediately (eg, if an outpatient trial patient initially seeks treatment \nelsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and \ndocument the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.\nFor all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information \nto Pfizer in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an \ninvestigator may be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in \nan expedited fashion.  This information collected for serious adverse events is more detailed \nthan that captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, this will include a \ndescription of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical \nassessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Information on \nother possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines and/or illnesses \nmust be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings \nmust be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated representative. \n",

No testing \nfor ROS1 or MET may be performed prior to patient enrollment.  As of the Note to File dated \n19 June 2012, the requirement that no molecular testing for MET or ROS1 to occur prior to\nenrollment was removed.  However, if MET or ROS1 testing was performed prior to patient \nenrollment and the test result for either MET or ROS1 was positive, then the patient could \nnot be enrolled onto this cohort.\nFurther details for the ALK marker negative NSCLC Cohort #2 are provided in Appendix 8.\n9.1.3.2. MET-Amplified NSCLC Cohort\nIn order to further evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 associated with MET\namplification, patients with MET-amplified NSCLC will be enrolled into one of the \nfollowing categories:\n\uf0b7\nHigh Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b35.0; Group 1): As per \nthe PACL dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-off for this group was revised \nto \u22654.0). As per the PACL dated 11 September 2018, this group was closed to further \nenrollment. The remaining 14 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 \nalterations subgroup within the Enriched Other cohort.\n\uf0b7\nMedium Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio >2.2 to <5; Group \n2): As per the PACL dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-off for this group \nwas revised to >2.2 to \uf03c4.0 and this group was closed to further enrollment. The \nremaining 13 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations \nsubgroup within the Enriched Other cohort; \n\uf0b7\nLow Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b31.8 to \uf0a32.2; Group 3):  \nAs per the PACL dated 12 October 2015, this group was closed to further enrollment.\nFor each category, an ORR of 10% was considered to be uninteresting for further study for \nthis category with 30% considered interesting for further exploration.  Using a Simon optimal \ntwo-stage design with alpha=0.05 and 80% power, a test of the null hypothesis that p \n\uf0a310% versus the alternative p \uf0b330% requires 10 evaluable patients in the first stage.  If \n\uf0a31 objective response (CR or PR) is observed in the first 10 patients for any category, no \nadditional patients in that category will be enrolled.  If 2 or more objective responses are \nobserved in the first stage for any category, the first stage may be expanded by enrolling \n19 additional patients in that category.  However, upon completion and evaluation of the first \nstage, a decision will be made whether or not to expand to the second stage in any of the \n3 categories investigated.  Within a category, if >5 objectives responses are observed, the \nnull hypothesis will be rejected. \nAs of a PACL issued June 27, 2014, 4 objective responses were observed in the High Level \nMET Gene Amplification category and the cohort was expanded to an additional 19 patients, \nfor a total of 29-31 patients.  As of a PACL issued October 28, 2014, 2 objective responses \nwere observed in the Medium Level MET Gene Amplified category and the cohort was \nexpanded to an additional 19 patients, for a total of 29-31 patients.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\nFurther details for the MET-amplified NSCLC cohort are provided in Appendix 9.\nTo increase the likelihood of achieving the target enrollment of approximately 20 to \n25 evaluable male patients with hypogonadism testing in a timely manner, the Sponsor \ndecided to close enrollment of patients into the MET low amplification NSCLC category \n(MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b31.8 to \uf0a32.2) due to slow enrollment, effective as of the Protocol \nAdministrative Clarification Letter dated 12 October 2015.  Thus, the remaining unused \nenrollment slots (estimated to be approximately 28: 9 from Simon first-stage and 19 from \nSimon second-stage) was transferred to the Enriched Other cohort.  With Sponsor approval \nand IRB/EC notification, other conditions including, but not limited to, slow enrollment in \nthe medium and/or high level MET amplification categories, may trigger transfer of \nadditional enrollment slots from these MET gene amplification categories to the Enriched \nOther cohort.  As per the PACL dated 15 May 2017, further enrollment of NSCLC patients \ninto the MET intermediate amplification group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment \nslots were transferred to the Enriched Other cohort to facilitate further enrollment of patients \nwith MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC. As per the PACL dated 11 September 2018, further \nenrollment of NSCLC patients into the MET high amplification group was closed and the \nremaining 14 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations subgroup\nwithin the Enriched Other cohort.\n9.1.3.3. ROS1 Marker Positive NSCLC Cohort\nTo further evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with NSCLC positive \nfor a chromosomal translocation in the ROS1 gene, approximately 30 patients will be \nenrolled.  An ORR of 10% was considered to be uninteresting for further study for this cohort \nwith 30% considered interesting for further exploration.  With 27 evaluable patients, there is \nat least 85% power to test the null hypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 0.10 vs. \nthe alternative hypothesis that it is greater than 0.10 assuming an alternative target rate of \n0.30 with a one-sided alpha=0.05 using a single stage design.  The null hypothesis will be \nrejected if greater than or equal to 6 objective responses are observed among the \n27 evaluable patients.  A total of approximately 30 patients will be enrolled into this cohort \nto adjust for 10% loss of patients who are not evaluable for response.\nAs of a database snapshot date of 19 April 2012, 8 confirmed objective responses (CR, \npartial response [PR]) were observed in a total of 14 response evaluable patients enrolled in\nthe ROS1 marker-positive NSCLC cohort. Based on the number of confirmed objective \nresponses observed (CR, PR), the null hypothesis was rejected. As recorded in the Note to \nFile dated 12 November 2012, and in Protocol Amendment 20, the sample size of the ROS1\nmarker-positive NSCLC cohort was increased to a total of 50 patients in order to provide a \nmore robust estimation of antitumor activity in this patient population.\nFurther details for the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort are provided in Appendix 10.\n9.1.3.4. Enriched Other Cohort\nTo evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with other tumor types that \nhave a molecular marker that confers sensitivity to PF-02341066 (eg, other tumor types \nbesides NSCLC), the sample size of the Enriched Other cohort will be dependent upon the \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\nnumber of enrolled patients meeting the criteria for this cohort; however it is anticipated that \napproximately 171 patients will be enrolled.\nFurther details for the Enriched Other cohort are provided in Appendix 11.\nIn the Enriched Other cohort, approximately 50 NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET\nExon 14 alterations will be enrolled.  In addition, a separate group of approximately \n5 NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations will be enrolled in \nclinical sites in Japan. With Sponsor written approval and IRB/EC notification, additional \npatients may be enrolled as described earlier in this section (Section 9.1) to reach this target \nenrollment in the event that overall enrollment is achieved prior to reaching this target.  \nIn NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations, an ORR of 10% will be\nconsidered uninteresting for further study for this group, with 30% considered interesting for \nfurther exploration.  With 33 evaluable patients, there is at least 90% power to test the null \nhypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 0.10 versus the alternative hypothesis that it \nis greater than 0.10 assuming an alternative target rate of 0.30 with a one-sided \u03b1=0.05 based \non a single stage design using exact test.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if \uf0b37 objective \nresponses are observed among the first 33 evaluable patients.  As of data cutoff date 01 \nAugust 2016, 11 confirmed objective responses (CR, PR) were observed in a total of 28 \nresponse-evaluable patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  Based on the number of \nconfirmed objective responses observed, the null hypothesis was rejected. The proportion of \nresponders will be estimated with better precision if the number of evaluable patients exceeds \n33 patients.\n1. As of Amendment 23 (21 February 2017), the sample size in the Enriched Other \ncohort was further increased to a total of 130 patients, including approximately \n50 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  In addition, a separate group of \napproximately 5 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was planned to be \nenrolled in clinical sites in Japan.  \n2. As of the PACL issued 15 May 2017 further enrollment of NSCLC patients into the \nMET intermediate amplification group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment \nslots were transferred to the Enriched Other cohort to facilitate further enrollment of \npatients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a result, the total enrollment for \npatients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was increased to 68 patients (50 original \npatients + 13 transferred slots + 5 Japanese patients). \n3. As of the PACL issued 07 December 2017, sites were allowed to enroll additional 13 \npatients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC into the Enriched Other cohort, which \nwere originally slotted for the broader Enriched Other cohort and were now assigned \nspecifically to patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a result, the total \nenrollment of the Enriched Other cohort subset of patients with MET \nExon 14-positive NSCLC increased to 81 patients (68 + 13 patients).  \n4. As of the PACL issued 11 September 2018, further enrollment of NSCLC patients \ninto the MET high amplification group was closed and the remaining 14 enrollment \n",

AE severity will be graded according to NCI Common \nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. \nA listing of all AEs including detailed information collected for each AE (description of \nevent, onset date/time, duration, seriousness, severity, relationship to study drug, action \ntaken, clinical outcome) will be presented. \nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced any: AE, serious AE (SAE), \ntreatment related AE, and treatment related SAE will be summarized.  The denominator used \nto calculate incidence percentages consists of patients receiving at least 1 dose of \nPF-02341066.  AE data will be presented by dosing schedule across cycles and for each \ncycle.  The denominator for each cycle is defined as those patients available at the start of the \ncycle who received at least 1 dose of PF-02341066 for that cycle.  Emphasis in the analyses \nwill be placed on AEs classified as treatment emergent. \nAdditional summaries of adverse events (AE) and of other safety data will be presented in \ntabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, as appropriate.\nAnalysis of Clinical Labs: Listing tables will be prepared for each laboratory measure, and \nwill be structured to permit review of the data by patient as they progress on treatment.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 116\nSummary tables, graphic displays and shift tables, as appropriate, will be prepared to \nillustrate the results over time on study.\n9.2.9. [18F]-FLT-PET Analysis\nFor [18F]-FLT-PET, SUV will be calculated for each evaluable lesion at baseline and then \naverage baseline SUV will be determined.  The mean change in the SUV from baseline for \neach lesion within a patient and overall for each patient will be determined and the overall \nmean change will be calculated.  Descriptive statistics in tabular form will be used to \nsummarize the results.\n9.3. Interim Analysis\nNo formal interim analysis will be conducted for this study. However, as this is an \nopen-label study, the Sponsor may conduct unblinded reviews/reporting of the data during \nthe course of the study for the purpose of safety and efficacy assessment, facilitating \ndose-escalation decisions, facilitating pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) \nmodeling, and/or to support clinical development.\n9.4. Data Monitoring Committee \nAn external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will not be established for the study.  The \nPF-02341066 Clinical Team will monitor safety throughout the project through the following \nefforts:\n\uf0b7\nSurveillance for serious adverse experiences (SAEs) according to regulatory \nguidelines.\n\uf0b7\nRoutine monitoring of non-serious adverse experiences as they are recorded in the \ncase report forms or appear in the source documents at the study sites.\n\uf0b7\nPeriodic teleconferences with the principal investigators on individual studies to share \nexperiences and ensure communication.\nFindings having immediate implication for the management of patients on study will be \ncommunicated to all Principal Investigators in the timeframe associated with unexpected and \ndrug-related SAEs.\nSafety surveillance studies will include routine monitoring of clinical laboratory parameters, \nphysical examination, adverse event (AE) reporting, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, \nand cardiac function studies.  Increased monitoring of certain serum biochemistry, blood \ncount, imaging studies/cardiac studies and physical examination will be dependent on animal \ntoxicology findings and consultation with The Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nPfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during the study conduct to ensure \nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may \nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The \ninvestigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate \nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This \nverification may also occur after study completion.\nDuring study conduct and/or after study completion, the trial site may be subject to review by\nthe institutional review board (IRB)/ ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality assurance \naudits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to \ninspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nThe investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection \nnotification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer \nor its agents to prepare the study site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, \nwhenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator \nwill promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the \npatient's medical records.  The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection \nfindings to Pfizer or its agent.  Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the \ninvestigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on \nresponses to any such findings.\nIt is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the \nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the \nprocess. \n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record\nAs used in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to \neither a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection \nmethod used in this trial.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to \nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory \nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nThe investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, \nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source \ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, \nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The \nCRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the \ndata contained on the CRFs is true.  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source \ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the \noriginal entry.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 118\nIn most cases, the source documents will be the hospital's or the physician's chart. In cases \nwhere the source documents are the hospital or the physician's chart, the information \ncollected on the CRFs must match those charts. \nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as the source documents.  In \nthese cases, a document should be available at the investigator\u2019s site as well as at Pfizer and \nclearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand \nas the source document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient \ninformation to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed \nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and \ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant \ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be \nretained by the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) \nguidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, \nwhichever is longer.\nIf the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the \nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified.  The trial \nrecords must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, \nanother institution, or to and independent third party arranged by Pfizer.  Investigator records \nmust be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or \nfor longer if required by applicable local regulations. \nThe investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, \neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12. ETHICS\n12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)\nIt is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the trial protocol, \nprotocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, \neg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC.  All correspondence with the \nIRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be \nforwarded to Pfizer.\nThe only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is \nwhere the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In \nthat event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after \nthe implementation.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Trial\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory \nrequirements, and the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for \nBiomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of \nMedical Sciences 2002), ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, (ICH 1996), and the \nDeclaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 2008).\n12.3. Patient Information and Consent\nAll parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names \nor other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where \nrequired by law.\nWhen study data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, patient \nnames, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical code consisting \nof a numbering system provided by Pfizer in order to de-identify the study patients. The \nstudy site will maintain a confidential list of patients who participated in the study linking \neach patient\u2019s numerical code to his or her actual identity.\nIn case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection \nof patients\u2019 personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws.\nThe informed consent documents and any patient recruitment materials must be in \ncompliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including \napplicable privacy laws.\nThe informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and any patient \nrecruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by Pfizer, approved by the IRB/EC \nbefore use, and available for inspection. \nThe investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his or her legally acceptable \nrepresentative is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible \nrisks associated with participation. \nWhenever consent is obtained from a patient\u2019s legally acceptable representative, the patient\u2019s \nassent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the \ncapacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC.  If the investigator determines that \na patient\u2019s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonably be consulted, as \npermitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, then \nthe patient\u2019s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not \nobtained.  If the study patient does not provide his/her own consent, the source documents \nmust record why the patient did not provide consent (eg, decisionally impaired adult), how \nthe investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient\u2019s legally \nacceptable representative, the consent signer\u2019s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent,\nspouse) and that the patient\u2019s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally it \nmust be documented in the source documents.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 120\nThe investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed \nconsent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative before any \nstudy-specific activity is performed.  The investigator will retain the original of each patient's \nsigned consent form.\nNote: For investigational sites using WIRB, patients who lack the capacity to consent for \nthemselves will not be able to enroll into this study.\n12.4. Patient Recruitment\nAdvertisements approved by ethics committees and investigator databases may be used as \nrecruitment procedures. \n12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable \nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any new \ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the \ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. \nIn addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures \ntaken by the investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of \nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\nEnd of Trial in all participating sites is defined as the time at which it is deemed that \nsufficient patients have been recruited and completed the trial as specified in the protocol and \nthe clinical study report (CSR) has been finalized.\n14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority \ndecision, change in opinion of the IRB/EC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of \nPfizer.  In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-02341066 at \nany time.\nIf a trial is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the \ninvestigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and \nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a time period set by Pfizer.  As directed by \nPfizer, all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent \npossible.\n15. PUBLICATION OF TRIAL RESULTS\nPfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the \nresults of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials \nDatabase (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with \napplicable local laws/regulations. \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 121\nIn all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and \ncomplete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in \nwhich the study was conducted.\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov\nPfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for all Pfizer-sponsored \ninterventional studies conducted in patients that evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer \nproduct, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted.

RECIST version 1.0 Tumor Assessment Criteria17\nAt baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable (defined \nbelow).\nAll baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the first day of study \ntreatment and never more than 4 weeks before starting therapy.\nMeasurable Lesions\n\uf0b7\nLesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to \nbe recorded) as \uf0b32.0 cm with conventional techniques or \uf0b31.0 cm with spiral \nCT scan.\n\uf0b7\nA tumor lesion that is situated in a previously irradiated area is eligible for \nmeasurable disease provided: 1) there has been documented disease progression in \nthis site; 2) the criteria for measurability as outlined above are met; 3) this is not the \nonly site of measurable disease.\n\uf0b7\nAll measurements should be determined using a ruler, calipers or digital technology, \nand recorded on the CRF in metric notation.\nNonmeasurable Lesions\nAll other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <2.0 cm with conventional \ntechniques or <1.0 cm with spiral CT) and truly nonmeasurable lesions.  Truly \nnonmeasurable lesions include bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or \npericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis or pulmonis, abdominal \nmasses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions.\nDocumentation of Target and Nontarget Lesions\nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, \nrepresentative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and measured and \nrecorded at baseline.  Target lesions (measurable) should be selected on the basis of their size \n(lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements \n(either by imaging techniques or clinically. A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target \nlesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be \nused as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as nontarget lesions and should also \nbe recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required, and these lesions should be \nfollowed as present or absent.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 127\nTechniques for Assessing Measurable Disease\nThe same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each \nidentified and reported lesion at screening and during follow-up.  Imaging-based evaluation \nis preferred to evaluation by clinical (physical) examination when both methods have been \nused to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.\nAccepted methods of tumor assessment include:\nClinical examination: clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when \nthey are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin \nlesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the \nlesion is recommended.\nChest x-ray: lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are \nclearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.\nCT and MRI: CT and MRI are the best currently available and most reproducible methods \nof measuring target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI \nshould be performed with contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness.  Spiral CT \nshould be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.\nUltrasound: should not be used to measure tumor lesions for objective response evaluation.  \nIt is however a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable nodes, \nsubcutaneous lesions and non-small cell lung nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm \nthe complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.\nEndoscopy and Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor \nevaluation has not yet been fully or widely validated.  Utilization of such techniques for \nobjective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers.  \n \nTumor markers: tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are \ninitially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered a \ncomplete clinical response.\nCytology and histology: the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion \nthat appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for \nresponse or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease \n(an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.\nResponse Criteria\nThe following RECIST criteria will be the primary method utilized in this study for the \nassessment and reporting of tumor response data.\nCCI\n",

RECIST version 1.1 Tumor Assessment Criteria18\nAt baseline, individual tumor lesions will be categorized by the investigator as either \nmeasurable or not, according to the criteria summarized below:\nMeasurable Lesions\nLesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the \nplane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: \n\uf0b7\n10 mm for lesions other than lymph nodes and assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice \nthickness no greater than 5 mm).\n\uf0b7\n10 mm for lesions assessed clinically by caliper measurement (lesions which cannot \nbe accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable).\n\uf0b7\n20 mm for lesions assessed by chest X-ray.\n\uf0b7\n15 mm in short axis for lymph nodes when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice \nthickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). \nNon-measurable Lesions\nNon-measurable lesions include small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological \nlymph nodes with a \uf0b310 but <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  \nTruly non-measurable lesions include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial \neffusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal \nmasses identified by physical exam and not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.\nNodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be \nrecorded or followed. \nSpecial Considerations Regarding Specific Lesions \nBone lesions:\n\uf0b7\nBone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques \nto measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the \npresence or disappearance of bone lesions.\n\uf0b7\nLytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue \ncomponents, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT \nor MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets \nthe definition of measurability described above.\n\uf0b7\nBlastic bone lesions are non-measurable. \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 131\nCystic lesions:\n\uf0b7\nLesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be \nconsidered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they \nare, by definition, simple cysts.\n\uf0b7\n\u2018Cystic lesions\u2019 thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as \nmeasurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  \nHowever, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for \nselection as target lesions.\nLesions with prior local treatment:\n\uf0b7\nTumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other \nloco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been \ndemonstrated progression in the lesion.\nSolitary lesions:\nIf a measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be \nconfirmed by cytology/histology. \nRecording Tumor Measurements\nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and up to 5 in total and \nrepresentative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and \nrecorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment.  Target lesions should be \nselected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameters) and their suitability for \naccurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). \nThe longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion.  The sum of the longest \ndiameter of all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum diameter to \nbe used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable \ndimension of the disease during treatment. \nOne exception to the above described approach is related to pathological lymph nodes.  \nPathological lymph nodes are defined as measurable lesions and may be identified as target \nlesions if the criterion of a short axis of \uf0b315 mm by CT scan is met.  Only the short axis of \nthese nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  Nodal size is normally reported as two \ndimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the \naxial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal).  The smaller \nof these measures is the short axis. \nA sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all \ntarget lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The baseline \nsum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor \nregression in the measurable dimension of the disease.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 132\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should \nalso be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be \nfollowed as \u2018present\u2019, \u2018absent\u2019, or in rare cases \u2018unequivocal progression\u2019.  In addition, it is \npossible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on \nthe case record form (eg \u2018multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes\u2019 or \u2018multiple liver \nmetastases\u2019).\nDefinition of Tumor Response \nTarget Lesions\nResponse in target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. \n\uf0b7\nPartial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum \nif that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum \nmust also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  The appearance of one \nor more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression.\n\uf0b7\nStable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient \nincrease to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on \nstudy.\nWhen nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to \n\u2018normal\u2019 size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This \nmeasurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate \nprogression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means \nthat patients with CR may not have a total sum of \u2018zero\u2019 on the CRF.\nNon-Target Lesions\nWhile some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and \ninstead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. \nResponse in non-target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization \nof tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm \nshort axis).\n\uf0b7\nNon-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or \nmaintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 133\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  \n(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).\nCytology, Histology \nThese techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by \nprotocol (for example, residual lesions in germ cell tumors).  When effusions are known to \nbe a potential adverse effect of treatment (eg, taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), \nthe cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens \nduring treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or \nstable disease in order to differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive \ndisease.\nFor patients having effusions or ascites, only cases having cytological proof of malignancy \nshould be recorded on the CRF.  Effusions that have not been evaluated using cytology or \nwere found to be non-malignant should not be recorded on the CRF. \nNew Lesions \nThe appearance of new malignant lesions indicates PD.  New lesion should be unequivocal \n(eg, not attributable to differences in imaging technique, or change in imaging modality or \nfindings not attributable to tumor).  If a new lesion is equivocal, for example due to its small \nsize, continued therapy and follow-up assessment will clarify the etiology of the disease.  If \nrepeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared \nusing the date of the initial scan. \nThe use of FDG-PET is sometimes reasonable to complement a CT scan assessment of a PD \n(particularly for possible \u2018new\u2019 disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can \nbe identified according to the following algorithm: \n\uf0b7\nNegative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up \n\uf0b7\nNo FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow- up: if the positive \nFDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is \nPD.\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, \nadditional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring \nat that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that \nis not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.\nConfirmation of Tumor Response \nConfirmation of response is required for non-randomized trials with primary endpoint of \nresponse, but is not required in randomized studies since the control arm serves as \nappropriate means of interpretation of data.\n",

Rifampin Drug-Drug Interaction Sub-Study \nPatients will be enrolled into the rifampin interaction sub-study prior to the enrollment of \npatients in the itraconazole interaction sub-study.\nBackground:\nThe aim of this sub-study is to determine the effect of the co-administration of rifampin on the \nmultiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetics profile of PF-02341066.  The starting dose of \nPF-02341066 will be 250 mg BID and approximately 25 patients will be enrolled to obtain \n8 evaluable patients.  See Section 9.1.4 for further details.\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A4/5 are the major enzymes involved in the \nmetabolic clearance of PF-02341066. Co-administration of a single 250 mg PF-02341066 \ndose with rifampin (600 mg QD), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in 81.8% and \n68.5% decreases in PF-02341066 AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when \nPF-02341066 was given alone.13  As PF-02341066 is also a CYP3A inhibitor, the magnitude\nof the effects of CYP3A inducers on steady state PF-02341066 exposures may differ from \nthose seen after single doses. A mathematical modeling approach11 based on preclinical and \nclinical data indicate that rifampin co-administration is likely to result in an approximately \n36% decrease in the PF-02341066 AUC. Based on these findings no safety issues in using a \n250 mg BID PF-02341066 dose in combination with rifampin are anticipated.\nNote: Clinical sites in Korea will not participate in the rifampin interaction sub-study.\nPatient Population:  \nThis clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patients are enrolled.  The \nfollowing eligibility criteria are designed to select patients for whom protocol treatment is \nconsidered appropriate.

Itraconazole Drug-Drug Interaction Sub-Study\nThe aim of this sub-study is to determine the effect of itraconazole on the multiple-dose \nplasma pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 when itraconazole is co-administered.  If \nmultiple-dosing of PF-02341066 in combination with itraconazole is tolerable (as defined in \nthe Study Design Section), a cohort of patients may be also enrolled to determine the effect of \nitraconazole on single and multiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of PF-02341066.  \nAs of Protocol Amendment #22, the Single and Multiple-Dose Design will no longer be \nperformed.  The starting dose of PF-02341066 will be 250 mg QD and approximately\n25 patients will be enrolled to obtain at least 8 evaluable patients for multiple-dose PK.  See \nSection 9.1.5 for more details.  Patients who are enrolled in the study but not treated may be \nreplaced to obtain at least 8 evaluable patients for multiple-dose PK.\nThe magnitude of the effects of CYP3A inhibitors on steady state PF-02341066 exposures \nmay differ from those seen after a single dose of PF-02341066 as PF-02341066 is also a \nCYP3A inhibitor.  An autoinhibition-mediated change in apparent clearance of \nPF-02341066 was observed during chronic PF-02341066 treatment.  There are limited data\nwith single doses of PF-02341066 administered with ketoconazole (200 mg BID), a strong \nCYP3A inhibitor.  Co-administration of a single 150 mg oral dose of PF-02341066 in the \npresence of ketoconazole, resulted in increases in PF-02341066 systemic exposure, with \nPF-02341066 AUCinf and Cmax values that were approximately 3.2 fold and 1.4 fold higher, \nrespectively, than those seen when PF-02341066 was administered alone.14 SIMCYP (a \npopulation based pharmacokinetics modeling simulator) modeling12 based on preclinical and \nclinical data, predict a 2-fold increase in PF-02341066 AUC when PF-02341066, at steady\nstate, is co-administered with ketoconazole. The effect of itraconazole on PF-02341066\nexposure cannot be properly predicted due to the lack of a validated physiologically based \npharmacokinetic model.  Based upon recent FDA guidance15 on the use of ketoconazole, \nketoconazole was replaced with another CYP3A strong inhibitor, itraconazole.  However, it \nis expected that the magnitude of the effect of itraconazole would be no greater than that of \nketoconazole given that itraconazole had a smaller inhibitory effect on the exposure of \nmidazolam, a CYP3A probe, than ketoconazole.16  Therefore, the PF-02341066 exposure at \n250 mg QD when administered with itraconazole is expected to be similar to or lower than \nthe PF-02341066 exposure at the maximum tolerated dose of 250 mg BID when administered \nalone.  For these reasons, the same starting dose of PF-02341066 proposed for the \nketoconazole drug-drug interaction, will be used for the itraconazole drug-drug interaction, \nie, 250 mg QD.  However, should additional data arise impacting this assumption, the \nSponsor will adjust the starting dose of PF-02341066 accordingly. \nNote: Clinical sites in South Korea will not participate in the itraconazole drug-drug\ninteraction sub-study.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 146\nPatient Population: \nThis clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patients are enrolled.

During the study, real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring will be conducted as much \nas possible.\nAfter approval of Amendment #16, Day -7 dosing will only be required for dose escalation \ncohorts.\nThe PF-02341066 dose regimen may be changed if the pharmacokinetics and safety data \nsuggest that a discontinuous regimen or another dosing frequency may be preferable.  \nDosing of oral PF-02341066 will be based on flat milligram increments without adjustment \nfor body size.  The dose will be 50 mg QD in the initial cohort.\nPatients will be successively assigned to the next available treatment slot within a dose level. \nEach dose cohort will initially include a minimum of 3 evaluable patients for assessment of \ntoxicity within the first cycle.  Dose escalation will occur in 100% increments until either of \nthe following occurrences: (1) drug related toxicity of Grade 2 severity occurs in 2 or more \npatients within a dose level; or (2) mean unbound AUC0-24 exceeds 2.4 \uf06dg\u00b7h/mL (the highest \nunbound AUC tested in the one-month toxicology studies).  Escalation increments will then \nbecome 40%.  In any cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be \nenrolled to that dose level.  If 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience a DLT, no further dose \nescalation will occur.\nIf the highest cohort being evaluated is closed to new enrollment, additional patients who \nhave a cytogenetic abnormality as described in Section 4.1 (Inclusion #1) may enter the \nstudy at the previous dose level.  These patients will not participate in the midazolam \nsub-study and will not have the Day -7 lead-in dose of PF-02341066 or any corresponding \nPK assessments.  They will be evaluated for safety but will not contribute to the DLT \nassessments.  These patients will enter the study on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Additionally, patients \nscheduled to enroll in the RP2D enriched population cohort (see RP2D Cohorts Section) \nmay be exempted from the Day -7 lead-in dose depending on the their overall medical \ncondition.

Upon Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC)\napproval of Amendment #12, non-Asian patients will also be exempt from the Day -7 lead-in \ndose.  Amendment #13 extends the requirements as described in the first paragraph of this \nsection.\nDoses may not be modified until a DLT has been reached.  The study investigator may \nimplement dose suspension in order to ensure patient safety; this will be considered \ndose-limiting toxicity for the purpose of dose-escalation if PF-02341066 has to be suspended \nfor more than 3 days.

Dose escalation \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 26\nmay be stopped if 1) the maximum administered dose (MAD) produces PF-02341066 \nconcentrations that are at least 5-fold greater than the projected target concentration, \n2) exposure plateaus as the dose is increased and 3) MTD cannot be reached within a \nreasonable dose range (up to 2000 mg).  The MTD for both QD and BID dosing may be \ndetermined.\nMDZ interaction sub-study: The potential for CYP3A inhibition due to PF-02341066 will be \nevaluated using MDZ as a CYP3A4 substrate probe at 3 dose levels of PF-02341066: the \nnext higher dose after the initial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D (see Figure 4).  \nThe MDZ interaction study will be conducted starting in the second dose cohort, and will be \nconducted in a higher dose in which the trough unbound plasma concentration of \nPF-02341066 at the steady state will equal or exceed the projected target unbound \nconcentrations (8.1-12.8 nM) if target unbound plasma concentrations of PF-02341066 are \nnot achieved in the second cohort.  In the second cohort or the efficacious dose cohort, at \nleast 3 evaluable patients per cohort will be assessed for the effect of repeat PF-02341066 \nadministration on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam.  If a significant change in MDZ \nclearance (>3-fold increase in MDZ AUC in all 3 patients, or > 5-fold increase in 2 or more \npatients) is observed at any PF-02341066 dose level, further dose escalation may be \nterminated.  The effect of PF-02341066 on CYP3A activity will be evaluated at the RP2D.  \nEight evaluable patients will be required for the MDZ interaction study in one of the RP2D \ncohorts (see RP2D Cohorts Section).  Patients enrolled in the MDZ interaction sub-study will \nreceive a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on Day \u20137 and another single 2-mg oral dose of \nMDZ concurrently with PF-02341066 on Cycle 2 Day 1.\nRifampin interaction sub-study:\nThis sub-study is to determine the effect of the co-administration of rifampin on the\nmultiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetic profile of PF-02341066.  The starting dose of \nPF-02341066 will be 250 mg BID and the dose of rifampin will be 600 mg QD.  \nApproximately 25 patients with advanced malignancies refractory to standard of care \ntherapy, or for whom no standard of care therapy is available will be enrolled into this \nsub-study to obtain 8 evaluable patients.  The rationale for the PF-02341066 starting dose of \n250 mg BID is provided below.\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A4/5 are the major enzymes involved in the \nmetabolic clearance of PF-02341066. Co-administration of a single 250 mg PF-02341066 \ndose with rifampin (600 mg QD), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in 81.8% and 68.5% \ndecreases in PF-02341066 AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when PF-02341066 \nwas given alone.  As PF-02341066 is also a CYP3A inhibitor, the magnitude of the effects of \nCYP3A inducers on steady state PF-02341066 exposures may differ from those seen after \nsingle doses. A mathematical modeling approach based on preclinical and clinical data \nindicate that rifampin co-administration is likely to result in an approximately 36% decrease \nin the PF-02341066 AUC. Based on these findings no safety issues in using a 250 mg BID \nPF-02341066 dose in combination with rifampin are anticipated.\nPlease see Appendix 6 for further details.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 27\nNote that the Rifampin interaction sub-study will be enrolled prior to the enrollment of \npatients on the itraconazole interaction sub-study.\nItraconazole interaction sub-study: \nThis sub-study is to determine the effect of itraconazole on the multiple-dose plasma \npharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 when itraconazole is co-administered.

Therefore, the PF-02341066 exposure at \n250 mg QD when administered with itraconazole is expected to be similar or lower than the \nPF-02341066 exposure at the maximum tolerated dose of 250 mg BID when administered \nalone.  For these reasons, the same starting dose of PF-02341066 proposed for the \nketoconazole drug-drug interaction, will be used for the itraconazole drug-drug interaction, \nie, 250 mg QD.  However, should additional data arise impacting this assumption, the \nSponsor will adjust the starting dose of PF-02341066 accordingly. \nPlease see Appendix 7 for further details.\nRP2D Cohorts: The RP2D will be determined as a dose below or equal to MTD, at which \nPF-02341066 is unlikely to cause an inhibition of CYP3A4 activity.  There will be two RP2D \ncohorts:  \n1. The first RP2D cohort will evaluate drug-drug interactions. This includes the MDZ, \nrifampin and itraconazole interaction sub-studies noted above.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 28\na.

As of IRB/EC approval of \nProtocol Amendment #24, enrollment is closed with 41 patients treated.\nFurther details for the MET amplified NSCLC cohort are provided in \nAppendix 9. \nd. A group of 50 NSCLC patients positive for chromosomal translocations at \nROS1 gene, including but not limited to CD74-ROS1 and SLC34A2-ROS1\nfusion events, will be enrolled.  Enrollment is closed with 50 patients treated.  \nFurther details for the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort are provided in \nAppendix 10.\ne.\nApproximately 171 patients with disease with molecular markers (other than \nALK marker positive NSCLC and ROS1 marker positive NSCLC) that may \nconfer sensitivity to PF-02341066 may also be enrolled into an \u2018Enriched \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 29\nOther\u2019 cohort.  This cohort also includes NSCLC patients with tumors \nharboring MET Exon 14 alterations.  Sponsor approval is required for \nenrollment.  Further details for the Enriched Other cohort are provided in \nAppendix 11. After IRB/EC approval of Amendment #18, patients with \nNSCLC that is positive for ALK chromosomal translocations or gene \namplifications will not be allowed to enter the Enriched Other cohort. As of \nthe PACL dated 07 December 2017, the remaining 13 open enrollment slots in \nthe Enriched Other cohort were assigned specifically to NSCLC patients with \ntumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations rather than the broader Enriched \nOther cohort.  Thus, the Enriched Other cohort will be open only for \nenrollment of NSCLC patients with MET Exon 14 alterations. As of the \nInvestigator Communication Letter dated January 7, 2019, further enrollment \nof NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET exon 14 alterations is closed.\nf.\nALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #1: This cohort will consist of NSCLC \npatients who are negative for the ALK translocation as determined by the ALK \nbreak apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay used in Protocols \nA8081007 and A8081005.  A minimum of 25 to a maximum of 50 evaluable \npatients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed at the RP2D, \nie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks. Enrollment \nis closed with 47 patients treated.\ng. ALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #2: This cohort will consist of NSCLC \npatients who are negative for the ALK translocation as determined by the ALK \nbreak apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay as determined by \nthe central laboratory selected by the Sponsor.  Patients may have been \npre-screened and determined to have ALK-marker negative NSCLC by a local \ntest but no molecular testing for MET or ROS1 should have occurred prior to \nenrollment.  As of Note to File dated 19 June 2012, the requirement that no \nmolecular testing for MET or ROS1 was to occur prior to enrollment was \nremoved.  Thus, MET or ROS1 testing may have been performed prior to \npatient entry into this cohort.  However if the test result for either MET or \nROS1 was positive, then the patient could not be enrolled into this cohort.  At \nleast 20 patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed at the \nRP2D, ie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks.  \nEnrollment is closed with 21 patients treated.  Please see Appendix 8 for \nfurther details.\n  In addition, if possible, up to 6 patients will undergo \npre- and post-dose [18F]-fluorothymidine (FLT)-positron emission tomography (PET).  Also, \nif possible, the same patients who have biopsies performed, will undergo [18F]-FLT-PET. \nA separate sub-study with at least 6 evaluable patients with MET mutation or amplification \nwill undergo pre- and post-dose [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET.  \nWith the approval of Amendment #13 by the IRB/EC, no additional patients will undergo \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 30\nPET imaging.  Finally, 12 evaluable patients in this cohort will participate in a fed/fast \nsub-study.  Clinical sites in Korea will not participate in this sub-study.  Depending upon the \noverall results from the RP2D cohorts, a different dose/schedule may be tested in additional \ncohorts.\nStatistical Methods:\nThis is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study.  The number of patients to \nbe enrolled will depend upon the observed safety profile and study objectives, which will \ndetermine the number of patients per dose level, the number of dose escalations and the \nnumber of cohorts.  Approximately 600 patients will be enrolled in the study including \npatients in the dose escalation and RP2D cohorts [see Figure 1].  All patients who receive at \nleast 1 dose of PF-02341066 will be included in the study analyses.  All data will be \ntabulated and summarized using descriptive statistics. \nThe plasma concentration-time data of PF-02341066 will be analyzed using \nnon-compartmental methods to derive standard pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters including \nAUC0-last, Cmax and Tmax for individual patients.  Descriptive statistics of the PK parameters \nwill be provided in tabular form.  The plasma concentration-time data of MDZ will be \nanalyzed using non-compartmental methods to derive standard PK parameters including \nAUC0-last, Cmax and Tmax.  In the RP2D cohort, a mixed effects model will be used to analyze \nlog-transformed MDZ AUC0-last for evaluation of the potential CYP3A4 inhibition due to \nPF-02341066.  In the rifampin and itraconazole drug-drug interaction sub-studies, a mixed \neffect model will be used to analyze log-transformed PF-02341066 AUC0-tau to assess the \ninteraction. \nInferential statistics will be provided for assessing food effect, inhibition of CYP3A and the \ncomparison of anti-tumor effects in ALK marker negative NSCLC patients and ALK marker \npositive NSCLC patients (from Protocols A8081007 and/or A8081005, as appropriate).  In \nthe food effect sub-study, a mixed effect model will be used to analyze log transformed \nAUC0-last between fasting and fed conditions for the evaluation of the food effect.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 31\nSchedule of Activities\nThe Schedule of Activities table provides an overview of the protocol visits and procedures.

A 2-mg single oral dose of MDZ will be given on Day \u20137 and Cycle 2 Day 1.  On Cycle 2 Day 1, \nMDZ will be given concurrently with PF-02341066.\n30. If a biopsy is obtained, it should be performed no more than 3 days following completion of both [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET.  [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET \nshould be performed at least 24 hours apart.  With the approval of Amendment #13 by the IRB/EC, no additional patients will undergo PET imaging. \n31. Not required for additional patients who enter the study at a previous dose level when enrollment is closed for the current dose level or for patients enrolled in the RP2D \nenriched population cohort who are exempted for Day -7 dosing.  Also, upon site IRB/EC approval of Amendment #12, Day -7 dosing is also not required for non-Asian \npatients in the enriched population or ALK marker negative NSCLC cohorts.  Upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #13, only patients enrolled in the QD dose escalation \npart of the study or Asian patients enrolled in any cohort will have the Day -7 lead-in dose.\n32. Once Amendment #12 is approved by the IRB/EC, an ophthalmology examination will be performed at screening for all new patients.  The ophthalmology examination should \nbe repeated during the study when visual disturbances have been observed and when there is an increase in grade for visual disturbances (includes all ongoing patients).  The \nophthalmology examination should include ocular characteristics, visual acuity, fundoscopy and slit lamp examination.  All NSCLC patients enrolled after Amendment #17 is \napproved by the IRB/EC will undergo additional special ophthalmological testing as described in Section 7.3 until written notification by the Sponsor.  As of the Note To File\nissued 18 March 2016, the following ophthalmologic tests (added in Protocol Amendment #17) are no longer required for NSCLC patients: refractive error, pupil size, \nintraocular pressure, ocular coherence tomography, dilated fundus photography.  All ophthalmology examinations should be performed by an ophthalmologist.  Time points of \nthis special testing are designated by \u201c[ ]\u201d in the Schedule of Activities Table and are performed at Screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, one year, and yearly\nthereafter.  For NSCLC patients on a 4-week cycle, the yearly ophthalmology examination will be done at Cycle 14 Day 1, and every 13 cycles thereafter.  For NSCLC \npatients on a 3-week cycle, the yearly ophthalmology examination will be done at Cycle 18 Day 1 and every 17 cycles thereafter. These tests should also be done within 2-8 \nweeks after discontinuation of PF-02341066.  There is a \uf0b12 week window for the yearly ophthalmology examination.\n33. Hypogonadism Laboratory Tests (male patients only): All male patients enrolled into the MET-amplified NSCLC and Enriched Other cohorts after IRB/EC approval of \nProtocol Amendment #21 will have hypogonadism laboratory tests.  Required tests include: total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), \nluteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, dihydroepiandosterone sulfate, estradiol and prolactin.  Blood draws MUST be taken before PF-02341066 dosing and \nbetween 07:00 and 10:00 a.m. and, for each individual patient, the time of the draw should be as consistent across visits as feasible.  If either total testosterone or free \ntestosterone  decrease to a value that is both 25% lower than baseline and below the lower limit of normal, then a repeat laboratory test of both of these parameters must be \nperformed at the next clinic visit to confirm hypogonadism.  Note: Patients enrolled in clinical sites in Japan will not participate in hypogonadism testing.  See Section 7.2, \nAppendix 9, Appendix 11, and Appendix 12 for further details.\n34. Contraceptive Check: As of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21, male patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing potential will \nneed to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of 2 of the selected methods of contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the \nneed to use 2 highly effective contraception methods consistently and correctly and document such conversation and, upon IRB/IC approval of Amendment #23, the patient\u2019s \naffirmation in the patient\u2019s chart.  In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately if one or both selected contraception methods \nare discontinued, or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the patient\u2019s partner.  See Section 4.5.1 for further detail.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 37\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLIST OF TABLES...................................................................................................................41\nLIST OF FIGURES .................................................................................................................41\nAPPENDICES .........................................................................................................................42\n1.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1. Background\nHuman cancers comprise a diverse array of diseases that collectively are one of the leading \ncauses of death in developed countries throughout the world (American Cancer Society, \n2005).1  The progression of cancers is caused by a complex series of multiple genetic and \nmolecular events including gene mutations, chromosomal translocations, and karyotypic \nabnormalities (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2000).3  Although the underlying genetic causes of \ncancer are both diverse and complex, each cancer type has been observed to exhibit common \ntraits and acquired capabilities that facilitate its progression.  These acquired capabilities \ninclude dysregulated cell growth, sustained ability to recruit blood vessels (ie, angiogenesis), \nand ability of tumor cells to spread locally as well as metastasize to secondary organ sites \n(Hanahan & Weinberg, 2000).3  Therefore, the ability to identify novel therapeutic agents \nthat 1) inhibit molecular targets that are altered during cancer progression or 2) target \nmultiple processes that are common to cancer progression in a variety of tumors is predicted \nto yield improved therapeutic benefit.\nPF-02341066\nChemical Structure:\nO\nCl\nCl\nF\nN\nNH2\nN\nN\nNH\nChemical Name: \n(R)-3-[1-(2,6-Dichloro-3-fluoro-phenyl)-ethoxy]-5-(1-piperidin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-pyridi\nn-2-ylamine\nMolecular Formula: C21H22Cl2FN5O\nPF-02341066 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition\nfactor)/HGFR receptor tyrosine kinase.  The rationale for use of this mechanism to treat \ncancer is supported by an emerging paradigm in oncology that robust clinical efficacy can be \nobtained with well-tolerated inhibitors directed toward oncogenic tyrosine kinases that are \ngenetically altered through activating mutations, gene translocations, or gene amplification.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 44\nRecent examples include Gleevec\u00ae in gastrointestinal stromal tumors with mutant c-Kit or \nchronic myelogenous leukemia with BCR-Abl gene translocations, Tarceva\u00ae in non-small \ncell lung cancer with mutant EGFR, Herceptin\u00ae in breast cancers with amplified HER-2/neu, \nand SU11248 targeting the VHL-dependent VEGF pathway in renal cell carcinoma.  An \nextensive body of literature indicates that MET/HGFR is one of the most frequently mutated \nor otherwise abnormally activated RTKs in various human cancers (Christensen et al, 2005).2  \nTumor types in which MET/HGFR was reported to be genetically altered by mutation or \ngene amplification include oncology indications with a strong unmet medical need such as \nrenal, metastatic colorectal, glioma, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers \n(Christensen et al, 2005).2  In addition, PF-02341066 demonstrated potent activity against \nNPM-ALK, an oncogenic fusion protein variant of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase, which \nresults from a chromosomal translocation which is implicated in the pathogenesis of human \nanaplastic large cell lymphoma (Pulford et al, 2004).4  In addition to the rationale for \nPF-02341066 based on the genetic dysregulation of its tyrosine kinase targets, an additional \nrationale is based on its predicted ability to target multiple processes that are common to \ncancer progression in a variety of tumors.  Inappropriate activation of MET/HGFR (including \nwild-type MET) is implicated in dysregulation of multiple tumor oncogenic processes such \nas mitogenesis, survival, angiogenesis, invasive growth, and especially in the metastatic \nprocess (Christensen et al, 2005).2  Furthermore, the expression of MET and HGF, its sole, \nhigh-affinity ligand, were demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis or metastatic \nprogression in a number of major human cancers (Christensen et al, 2005).2  The other \nmolecular target of PF-02341066, NPM-ALK, is implicated in the dysregulation of cell \nproliferation and apoptosis in ALCL lymphoma cells (Pulford et al, 2004).4  Consistent with \nits predicted mechanism of action, PF-02341066 inhibited target-dependent tumor cell \nproliferation or invasion, induced tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited angiogenesis in \nnonclinical tumor models.  Oral administration of PF-02341066 also demonstrated efficacy, \nincluding marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed \nactivated MET/HGFR or NPM-ALK.  The collective rationale for investigation of \nPF-02341066 in clinical studies is built on genetic alteration of its molecular targets, its \npredicted ability to target multiple processes that are common to cancer progression, and \npreclinical efficacy data. \nSafety:\nThe primary PF-02341066 toxicities in nonclinical studies were observed in the \ngastrointestinal tract (rat, dog, monkey), hematopoietic system (rat, dog, monkey), kidneys \n(rat), reproductive organs (rat), and actively growing long bones (rat).  Additional effects \nrelated to PF-02341066 administration involved the cardiovascular system based on safety \npharmacology studies, and genetic toxicity findings.  Other findings of uncertain risk to \nhumans include the decreased cellularity in lymphoid organs, elevated liver enzymes, \npotential for phototoxicity, and effects on the salivary glands.\nGastrointestinal Effects: Clinical signs of diarrhea were observed in rats (500 mg/kg/day), \ndogs (\uf0b36 mg/kg/day), and monkeys (50 mg/kg/day).  Focal edema was observed in the \ngastric submucosa in rats given 500 mg/kg/day for 4 days, as well as focal ulceration, \ninflammation, and glandular hyperplasia in one female.  Gastrointestinal effects were not \nobserved in the 1-month study in rats, where doses were tolerated for the full term of the \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 45\nstudy.  Emesis and diarrhea were dose-limiting toxicities observed during the single-dose \nescalation range-finding study in dogs.  Following single doses of 10, 25, and 40 mg/kg, \nsevere gastrointestinal effects were observed, including bloody emesis and diarrhea, along \nwith mucous membranes in the feces.  Histopathological examination of the intestines \nrevealed blood-filled dilated mucosal and submucosal vessels (congestion) and luminal \ncontents of mucus admixed with low numbers of neutrophils.  In the 1-month study in dogs, \nPF-02341066 at \uf0b36 mg/kg/day induced emesis, the incidence and frequency of which \ndecreased as the study progressed, and occasional diarrhea.  There was no effect on food \nconsumption or body weight, and no histopathological correlate was identified at the end of\nthe study.  Diarrhea and soft feces were also observed in monkeys given 50 mg/kg/day of \nPF-02341066.  A decrease in phosphorus observed in this study may have been related to \ndecreased intestinal absorption.  Marked cecal erosion and ulceration were observed in one \nmonkey euthanized moribund on Day 21. \nKidney Effects: Microscopic evidence of minimal to mild renal cortical tubule vacuolation \nwas observed following 28 days of dosing in male rats treated with \uf0b350 mg/kg/day of \nPF-02341066.  Urinalysis revealed significant decreases in urine pH from 50 mg/kg/day in \nmales and at 150 mg/kg/day in females.  The mechanism for renal tubular vacuolation is not \nknown, however HGF is highly expressed in the kidney tubular epithelium (Birchmeier, \n2003)5 with reported cytoprotective effects on renal tubular epithelium (Liu, 1998).6  \nTestes Effects: Microscopic evidence of minimal testicular pachytene spermatocyte \ndegeneration was observed in rats given \uf0b350 mg/kg/day of PF-02341066 for 28 days.  The \nmechanism responsible for the degenerative effects in the testes is not understood, however \nMET is known to be expressed on human seminiferous epithelium and on immature and \nmature spermatozoa (Depuydt, 1996).7\nHematopoietic Effects: Bone marrow hypocellularity was observed in toxicity studies in rats \nand monkeys with PF-02341066.  Repeated administration of PF-02341066 for 28 days \ncaused bone marrow hypocellularity at doses of 150 mg/kg/day (rats, males only) and \n50 mg/kg/day (monkeys).  Minimal bone marrow hypocellularity was also produced in rats \nof both sexes when PF-02341066 was administered for shorter time duration (2 days at \n2000 mg/kg and 4 days at 500 mg/kg/day).  Bone marrow hypocellularity was not observed \nin dogs, however a decrease in white blood cells was identified following 3 single doses up \nto 40 mg/kg and 7 days of PF-02341066 at 20 mg/kg/day.  In monkeys, cytospin examination \nshowed evidence of increased numbers of macrophages and debris consistent with bone \nmarrow cytotoxicity, and correlated with the bone marrow hypocellularity observed \nhistopathologically.  Hematological analysis revealed decreased reticulocyte counts and\nsuggested suppression of erythroid production within the bone marrow.  In addition, WBC \nprecursors lacked granulation characteristically present in these cells suggesting potential \nperoxidase deficiency in granulocytes.  This change in granulation was also noted in dogs \ngiven 20 mg/kg/day for 28 days.  Vacuolated lymphocytes were identified in male rats given \n150 mg/kg/day, the significance of which is unclear. \nLymphoid Tissue Effects: Lymphoid depletion was observed in the thymus, spleen, lymph \nnodes, or GALT in rats and dogs given PF-02341066.  Findings in rats given 500 mg/kg/day \nfor 4 days were attributed to stress (stress leukogram and clinical signs of intolerance were \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 46\nobserved).  Decreased cellularity was also observed in lymphoid organs in the 1-month study \nin rats at \uf0b350 mg/kg/day, however, these findings were considered of uncertain origin.  \nDecreased thymus weight (\uf0b36 mg/kg/day) correlated to thymic lymphoid depletion in male \ndogs given 20 mg/kg/day PF-02341066 for 28 days, and was also considered to be of \nuncertain relationship to treatment. \nCardiovascular Effects: In vivo cardiovascular effects were observed in the safety \npharmacology study in anesthetized dogs.  PF-02341066 administration was associated with \ndecreases in heart rate and increases in LVEDP at 84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma \nconcentration.  There were also statistically significant differences compared with \nvehicle-treated animals in myocardial contractility (LV+dP/dt) at 164 ng/mL free plasma \nconcentration.  Although there was a statistically significant decrease in myocardial \ncontractility, it should be noted that the actual myocardial contractility values in the treated \nanimals were similar to the pre-dose values.  The main effects of PF-02341066 on ECG \nparameters were statistically significant increases in PR interval, QRS, and QT interval at \n84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma concentration.  The prolongation of PR-interval, QRS and \nQT-interval is probably due to the reduction in heart rate observed at these doses.  \nMonophasic action potential duration during cardiac pacing is a heart rate-independent index \nof cardiac repolarization.  There were statistically significant increases in MAPD100 at sinus \nrhythm at 84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma concentration.  The increases in MAPD100 at sinus \nrhythm were consistent with the decreases observed in heart rate.  The plasma concentrations \nof PF-02341066 achieved in this study were up to 44 times the free efficacious plasma level \npredicted in humans (8.1 nM or 3.7 ng/mL).  In vitro, PF-02341066 blocked potassium \ncurrents or human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel conduction with IC50 and IC20\nvalues of 1.1 \uf06dM (495 ng/mL) and 0.3 \uf06dM (135 ng/mL), respectively.  In the rat aortic \ntension model, in vitro dog isolated Purkinje fibers, and in freshly isolated Guinea pig \nventricular myocytes, PF-02341066 produced effects consistent with calcium channel \nantagonism.  The hERG assay, rat aortic model, Guinea pig myocyte assay, and Purkinje \nfiber data suggest that PF-02341066 is mixed-channel blocker and this may explain the lack \nof effect on MAPD100 during pacing in this study.  The decrease in diastolic blood pressure \nobserved at a free plasma concentration of 164 ng/mL may reflect the calcium channel \nantagonist effects observed in the rat isolated aorta model.  The nonclinical data suggest that \nfree plasma concentrations greater than or equal to 84 ng/mL may produce changes in the \nheart rate and at higher free plasma concentrations (164 ng/mL) changes in diastolic blood \npressure.\nBone Effects: Repeated administration of PF-02341066 for 28 days caused minimal \ndecreased bone formation at the primary spongiosa of growing long bones at a dose of \n150 mg/kg/day in male rats.  Though an off-target relationship cannot be ruled out, reports of \nin vitro data describe possible autocrine regulation of osteoclasts, paracrine regulation of \nosteoblasts (Grano, 1996),8 and modulation of bone resorptive activity of osteoclasts in \nresponse to HGF (Fuller, 1995),9 that may be suggestive of a pharmacological effect on bone.  \nThis toxicity is not expected in the adult patient population, whose growth plates are inactive.\nLiver Effects: An elevation in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate \naminotransferase [AST]) was observed in rats and monkeys given PF-02341066. Rats given \n2000 mg/kg/day for 2 days, 500 mg/kg/day for 4 days, or \uf0b350 mg/kg/day for 28 days showed \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 47\nan elevation in liver enzymes without a microscopic correlate.  Monkeys given 50 mg/kg/day \nof PF-02341066 also had elevated ALT and AST without histological correlate.  The \nelevation of liver enzymes is of uncertain relevance.\nGenotoxic Effects: PF-02341066 was associated with an increased frequency of structural \nchromosomal aberrations in the in vitro cytogenetics assay with and without metabolic \nactivation under the 3-hour test condition.  In addition to the clastogenic response, the \nkinetochore staining results from the in vitro micronucleus evaluation and the observation of \npolyploidy in the cytogenetics assay were consistent with an aneugenic response to\nPF-02341066.  Increased incidences in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (and \nmicronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes) were observed at all doses evaluated in vivo \n(rat) in males only.  The increases in micronuclei were associated with changes in other bone \nmarrow parameters consistent with bone marrow toxicity. \nPhototoxic Effects: PF-02341066 potential for phototoxicity was evaluated due to significant \nabsorbance in the UVA-UVB/visible range from 290 to 700 nm with a molar extinction \ncoefficient of \u22651000 L/Mol/cm, and its photodegradative property.  PF-02341066 was \nevaluated in the 3T3 fibroblast NRU assay with probable phototoxicity results.  Distribution \nof PF-02341066 to tissues with likely sun exposure is not known.  Patients will be advised to \navoid excessive sun exposure while on trial, eg by wearing long sleeve clothing and \nsunglasses and applying sunscreen when outdoors.\nOther Effects: Single-cell necrosis was observed in the ovaries and salivary glands of rats \ngiven 500 mg/kg/day that were euthanized on Day 4 due to moribundity.  Mild depletion of \nsecretory material was also observed in the salivary glands.  Effects in the ovaries and \nsalivary glands were not observed in the subsequent 1-month study.  Increases in WBC \ncounts were observed in the rat and monkey, consistent with an inflammatory response. \nComplete information on PF-02341066 may be found in the Single Reference Safety \nDocument (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator\u2019s Brochure.\n",

Paik et al (2015) reported on 3 crizotinib-treated \npatients with NSCLC harboring alterations leading to MET Exon 14 skipping. All 3\ncrizotinib-treated patients were shown to have a partial response.21  \nIn conclusion, MET has been shown to be a valid target, and PF-02341066 is a potent and \nselective inhibitor of MET.  PF-02341066 exhibits convincing antitumor activity in several \nxenograft models.  Importantly, it delivers antitumor efficacy in xenograft models with a \nlarge safety window, providing increased confidence that mechanism-based toxicity will not \nbe limiting in the clinic.\n1.2.1. Rationale for Selection of Starting Dose\nThe starting dose for PF-02341066 in the first in human (FIH) trial in cancer patients has \nbeen determined to be 50 mg daily, based on information derived from the 1-month repeat \ndose toxicology studies in rats and dogs (see current IB).\nThe doses tested in the 1-month toxicology rat study were 10, 50, and 150 mg/kg/day orally \nand the doses in the 1-month dog study were 1, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day orally.  In the rat study, \nthere were no deaths at any dose levels.  The NOAEL identified in the rat study was \n10 mg/kg/day.  Only mild to moderate toxicities were observed at the highest dose \n(150 mg/kg), indicating that the STD10 in rats was greater than 150 mg/kg (900 mg/m2).  \nThere was a significant gender difference suggesting that the male rat was more sensitive \nthan the female, associated with increased plasma exposure of PF-02341066 in male rats.  In \nthe dog study, no serious, irreversible toxicities were observed at any dose level.  Hence, the \nNOAEL was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day in the dog study.\nAccording to DeGeorge et al. (1998),10 the currently accepted algorithm for calculating a \nstarting dose in clinical trials for cytotoxic agents is to use one-tenth of the dose that causes \nsevere toxicity (or death) in 10% of the rodents (STD10) on a mg/m2 basis, provided this \nstarting dose does not cause serious, irreversible toxicity in a non-rodent species.  If \nirreversible toxicities are produced at the proposed starting dose in non-rodents or if the \nnon-rodent is known to be the more appropriate animal model, then the starting dose would \ngenerally be one-sixth of the highest dose tested in the non-rodent that does not cause severe, \nirreversible toxicity.  Since one-tenth of the highest dose tested in rats (90 mg/m2, equivalent \nto 4.5 mg/kg in dogs) did not cause any serious, irreversible toxicity in dogs, the starting dose \nin humans can be estimated as 90 mg/m2, ie, 150 mg daily dose, assuming body surface area \nof 1.7 m2 for humans.\nHowever, the 150 mg starting dose in humans would project a PF-02341066 plasma exposure \n(steady-state plasma AUC of 3.26 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL) exceeding the NOAEL (AUC of 2.16 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL \nat 10 mg/kg) in male rats, the most sensitive species.  Furthermore, since the plasma protein \nbinding for PF-02341066 is lower in humans (90.7%) than in rats (94.3%), the unbound \nAUC (AUCu) in humans (0.303 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL) at the 150 mg starting dose will be higher than \nthat at the NOAEL in rats (0.123 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL).  In humans, a dose of 61 mg is expected to yield \nan unbound drug plasma AUC approximately equal to that observed in rats at the NOAEL.  \nSince the exposure-based human dose projection provides a lower estimate for the clinical \nstarting dose (61 mg) than that based on 1/10 of the STD10 in rats (150 mg), this dose \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 50\nrounded to 50 mg (the highest available strength for a single capsule) once daily will be used \nas the starting dose for the FIH study.\n1.2.2. Rationale for Evaluation of Midazolam (MDZ) Interaction\nPF-02341066 is predominantly metabolized via the CYP3A isozymes in human liver \nmicrosomes and hepatocytes.  PF-02341066 also showed time-dependent inhibition of \nCYP3A isozymes in human liver microsomes with a kinact of 0.11 min-1 and KI of 3.0 \u03bcM.  \nBased on these values, the projected PF-02341066 therapeutic dose of 100 mg (Cmax, free\n19 nM) is predicted to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of co-administered drugs that \nare CYP3A substrates by approximately 80% due to CYP3A inhibition.  There is a potential \nfor more potent inhibition in patients receiving higher doses, leading to substantial drug \ninteractions with commonly coadministered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.  In addition, \nPF-02341066 may display nonlinear pharmacokinetics in patients that may require dose \nadjustments.  To mitigate these risks, a MDZ interaction sub-study has been built into this \nFirst in Human (FIH) study to assess the potential PF-02341066 related CYP3A inhibition. \nMDZ is a benzodiazepine used clinically for conscious sedation.  It undergoes extensive \nmetabolism via CYP3A4/5 and is a widely accepted in-vivo probe for assessing CYP3A \nactivity.  In the current trial, midazolam pharmacokinetics (PK) following a single oral 2-mg \ndose will be evaluated before and after repeated daily administration of PF-02341066 at 3 \ndose levels (the next higher dose after the initial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D),\nin order to assess the effects of PF-02341066 on CYP3A activity in the GI tract and the liver.  \nThe results of MDZ interaction study will be used to assist selection of the RP2D and to \ndetermine if there is any need for concomitant medication restrictions or dose modifications \nin future studies. \n2.

As of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21, all male \npatients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing potential, \nand are sexually active and at risk for pregnancy must agree to use 2 methods of highly \neffective contraception throughout the study and continued for at least 90 days after the last \ndose. The investigator or his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will confirm the \npatient has selected 2 appropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from \nthe list of permitted contraception methods (see below), and will confirm the patient has been \ninstructed in their consistent and correct use. Patients need to affirm that they meet the \ncriteria for correct use of two of the selected methods of contraception. The investigator or \nhis/her designee will discuss with the patient the need to use 2 highly effective contraceptive \nmethods consistently and correctly according to the Schedule of Activities and document \nsuch conversation and, upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #23, the patient\u2019s affirmation \nin the patient\u2019s chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient\nto call immediately if 1 or both of the selected contraceptive methods is discontinued or if \npregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the patient\u2019s partner. \nHighly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a \nfailure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and \ninclude:\n1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected, implanted or transdermal hormonal \nmethods of contraception are allowed provided the patient plans to remain on the \nsame treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal \ncontraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 59\n2. Correctly placed copper containing intrauterine device (IUD). \n3. Male condom or female condom used WITH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, \nsuppository).  For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus \nspermicide is not accepted as highly effective contraception, this option is not \nappropriate.\n4. Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post-vasectomy ejaculate.\n5. Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure \n(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device\u2019s label).\n6. Female partner who meets at least one of the criteria for non-childbearing potential as \ndescribed below (as of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21):\n\uf0b7\nHave undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;\n\uf0b7\nHave medically confirmed ovarian failure; or \n\uf0b7\nAchieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses \nfor at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or \nphysiological cause; laboratory confirmation [e.g., a serum follicle stimulating \nhormone level] may be indicated.\nAll other female patients (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be of \nchildbearing potential.\nFemale patients of childbearing potential must take precautions to prevent pregnancy since \nthe effects on the fetus are unknown.  \nAll sexually active male patients must agree to prevent potential transfer of and exposure to \ndrug through semen to their partners by using a condom consistently and correctly, beginning \nwith the first dose of investigational product and continuing for at least 90 days after the last \ndose.\nNote for patients enrolled in the rifampin interaction sub-study (see Appendix 6): female \npatients using oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives should additionally use \nnonhormonal methods of birth control during rifampin therapy.  Refer to Appendix 6 for \nfurther details.\n4.5.2. Sunlight Exposure\nPatients treated with PF-02341066 should avoid sunbathing, prolonged unprotected sun \nexposure, or tanning for the duration of the study. \n4.5.3. Dietary Restrictions\nThere is special requirement for patients who will participate in the MDZ interaction \nsub-study:\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 60\n\uf0b7\nPatients should not eat or drink products containing grapefruit from 7 days prior to \nenrollment until 24 hours after completion of MDZ administration on C2D1.\nFor patients enrolled in the rifampin interaction sub-study, refer to Appendix 6 for further \ndetails.\nFor patients enrolled in the itraconazole interaction sub-study, refer to Appendix 7 for \nfurther details.\n4.6. Sponsor\u2019s Qualified Medical Personnel\nThe contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the \nstudy is documented in the study contact list located in the Investigational Site Folder.\nTo facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical \nquestions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card.  The contact card contains, \nat a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study numbers, \ncontact information for the investigational site, and contact details for a contact center in the \nevent that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical \nquestion or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the \npatient\u2019s participation in the study.  The contact number can also be used by investigational \nstaff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used \nonly in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational \nsite and the study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, \nthe established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team \nfor advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study.  The contact\nnumber is not intended for use by the patient directly, and if a patient calls that number, he or \nshe will be directed back to the investigational site.\n5. TRIAL TREATMENTS\nFor the purposes of this study, and per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) \nguidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active \ningredient being tested in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization \nwhen used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved \nform, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information \nabout an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).  \nFor this study, the investigational product is PF-02341066.\nPF-02341066 will be administered orally once or twice a day in continuous 28-day cycles \nexcept 21-day cycles for patients in the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort (see Schedule \nof Activities and Appendix 8).\nThere will be a lead-in period in which single-dose pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 or \nMDZ (for patients participating in the MDZ sub-study) will be characterized prior to \ninitiation of continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment.  With the exception of cohorts \nin which the evaluation of a MDZ interaction is scheduled or patients who are exempted \nfrom the Day -7 lead-in dose (see below), all other patients will receive a single dose of \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 61\nPF-02341066 seven days prior to the start of Cycle 1 (Day \u20137) in order to characterize the \ncomplete PK profile of PF-02341066 after a single dose.  With the approval of \nAmendment #13, only patients enrolled in the QD dose escalation part of the study or Asian \npatients enrolled in any cohort will have the Day -7 lead-in dose.  Patients enrolled in the \nMDZ interaction sub-study will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on Day \u20137.  These \npatients will receive another single 2-mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with PF-02341066 \non Cycle 2 Day 1.  During the study, real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring will be conducted \nas much as possible.\nThe PF-02341066 dose regimen may be changed if the pharmacokinetics and safety data \nsuggest that a discontinuous regimen or another dosing frequency may be preferable.  If a \nBID dosing regimen is incorporated, all study assessments will be based on morning dosing \n(Day -7 dosing will still be a single PF-02341066 dose).  Dosing of oral PF-02341066 will \nbe based on flat milligram increments without adjustment for body size.  The dose will be \n50 mg QD in the initial cohort.\nPatients will be successively assigned to the next available treatment slot within a dose level. \nEach dose cohort will initially include a minimum of 3 evaluable patients for assessment of \ntoxicity within the first cycle.  Dose escalation will occur in 100% increments until either of \nthe following occurrences: (1) drug related toxicity of Grade 2 severity occurs in 2 or more \npatients within a dose level; or (2) mean unbound AUC0-24 exceeds 2.4 \uf06dg\u00b7h/mL (the highest \nunbound AUC tested in the one-month toxicology studies).  Escalation increments will then \nbecome 40%.  In any cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be \nenrolled to that dose level.  If 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience a DLT, no further dose \nescalation will occur (see Figure 4).  Patients will continue treatment at their assigned dose \nlevel for at least 2 cycles to observe for cumulative toxicity.  They may then be treated at the \nnext higher dose level provided it has been shown to be safe in a previously treated cohort.\nIf the highest cohort being evaluated is closed to new enrollment, additional patients who \nhave a cytogenetic abnormality as described in Section 4.1 (Inclusion #1) may enter the \nstudy at the previous dose level.  These patients will not participate in the midazolam \nsub-study and will not have the Day -7 lead-in dose of PF-02341066 or any corresponding \nPK assessments.  They will be evaluated for safety but will not contribute to the MTD \nassessments.  These patients will enter the study on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Additionally, patients \nscheduled to enroll in the RP2D enriched population cohort (see RP2D Cohorts Section) \nmay be exempted from the Day -7 lead-in dose depending on the their overall medical \ncondition.  This exemption will be granted on a case-by-case basis as agreed upon by the \ninvestigator and Sponsor.  Upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #12, non-Asian patients \nwill also be exempt from the Day -7 lead-in dose.  Amendment #13 extends the requirements \nas described in the second paragraph of this section.  Upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment \n#16, Day -7 lead-in dose will only be required for the dose escalation cohort.\nDefinition of MTD\nThe MTD will be defined as the dose level at which at most one of six patients experience \nDLT after 28 days of treatment have occurred (end of Cycle 1) with the next higher dose \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 62\nhaving at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients experiencing DLT.  The Sponsor with the agreement of the \ninvestigators may expand the cohort beyond six patients to better define the safety profile of \nthis cohort in the search for the MTD.  The MTD may be determined for both QD and BID \ndosing.  As of Protocol Amendment #20, the MTD determined from the QD dose escalation \ncohort will not be expanded beyond 6 patients.\nDefinition of DLT\nDLT will have occurred when the patient has one or more of the toxicities noted in the\nTable 1.  To determine dose escalation between cohorts, a DLT must occur within the first \n28 days of treatment (end of Cycle 1).  Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI \nCTCAE Version 3.0 (see Table 1).\nTable 1.\nDose Limiting Toxicities\nToxicity Category\nToxicity/Grade\nHematologic\nProlonged grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days\na Febrile neutropenia, defined here as grade 4 neutropenia with fever \n>38.5\uf0b0C, both sustained over a 24 hour period.\nNeutropenic infection: \uf0b3Grade 3 neutropenia with Grade \uf0b33 infection\nGrade \uf0b33 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or grade 4 lasting \uf0b37 days \nLymphopenia is not considered a DLT unless accompanied by infection.\nOther non-hematologic toxicity\nGrade 3 or 4 toxicities (except for alopecia, Grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia, \ngrade 3 hypertension with controlled blood pressure [<140/90], and \nGrade 3/4 hyperuricemia without signs and symptoms of gout).  Nausea, \nvomiting or diarrhea must persist at grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical \ntherapy.\na\nFebrile neutropenia qualifies as a DLT only if the fever and neutropenia are documented to be coincident \nin time and reconfirmed.\nDoses may not be modified until a DLT has been reached.  The study investigator may \nimplement dose suspension in order to ensure patient safety; this will be considered \ndose-limiting toxicity for the purpose of dose-escalation if PF-02341066 has to be suspended \nfor more than 3 days.  The occurrence of a DLT necessitates immediate interruption of the \nscheduled study treatment in that patient.  Resumption of study treatment for patients \nexperiencing DLTs is permitted, contingent on the return of the DLT to <Grade 1 severity \nand interruption or delay in treatment for no more than 4 weeks.  Resumption of treatment \nafter resolution of a DLT will be at the next lower dose level tested (or 50% lower if the DLT \noccurs with the first dose level).  Patients who discontinue treatment before completing \nCycle 1 (DLT evaluation period) for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity (ie, missed \nappointments, misplaced study drug supplies, development of coexisting medical condition \nrendering the patient unable to swallow medication, development of rapidly progressing \ndisease) will be replaced.\nTo contribute information to the assessment of safety for any dose level, a patient must \nreceive at least 75% of the planned PF-02341066 doses or experience a treatment-related \nAE that prompts early treatment interruption or discontinuation.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 63\nOne or more lower dose level(s) may be tested in search of the MTD, defined as the dose \nlevel immediately below that in which 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience DLTs.  Dose escalation \nmay be stopped if 1) MAD produces PF-02341066 concentrations that are at least 5-fold \ngreater than the projected target concentration, 2) exposure plateaus as the dose is increased \nand 3) MTD cannot be reached within a reasonable dose range (up to 2000 mg).\nMidazolam interaction sub-study\nThe potential for CYP3A inhibition due to PF-02341066 will be evaluated using MDZ as a \nCYP3A4 substrate probe at 3 dose levels of PF-02341066: the next higher dose after the \ninitial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D (see Figure 4).  The MDZ interaction study \nwill be conducted starting in the second dose cohort, and at a higher dose (ie, the predicted \nefficacious dose) in which the trough unbound plasma concentration of PF-02341066 at the \nsteady state will equal or exceed the projected target unbound plasma concentrations \n(12.8 nM).  If the target unbound plasma concentration of PF-02341066 is achieved in the \nsecond cohort, then the MDZ sub-study may not be performed with the higher dose cohort.  \nIn the second cohort or the efficacious dose cohort, at least 3 evaluable patients per cohort \nwill be assessed for the effect of repeat PF-02341066 administration on the \npharmacokinetics of midazolam.  If a significant change in MDZ clearance (>3-fold increase \nin MDZ AUC in all 3 patients, or >5-fold increase in 2 or more patients) is observed at any \nPF-02341066 dose level, further dose escalation may be terminated.\nThe effect of PF-02341066 on CYP3A activity will be evaluated at the RP2D.  Eight \nevaluable patients will be required for the MDZ interaction study in one of the RP2D cohorts \n(see RP2D Cohorts Section).  The results of the MDZ interaction sub-study at the RP2D will \nbe used to determine if there is any need for concomitant medication restrictions or dose \nmodifications in future PF-02341066 studies. \nPatients enrolled in the MDZ interaction sub-study will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of \nMDZ on Day \u20137 and another single 2-mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with PF-02341066 \non Cycle 2 Day 1 (morning dose if the BID regimen is employed).\nRifampin interaction sub-study: Refer to Appendix 6 for further details.\nItraconazole interaction sub-study: Refer to Appendix 7 for further details.\nRP2D cohorts\nThe RP2D will be determined as a dose below or equal to MTD, at which PF-02341066 is \nunlikely to cause an inhibition of CYP3A4 activity.  There will be two RP2D cohorts:\n1. The first RP2D cohort will evaluate drug-drug interactions. This includes the MDZ, \nrifampin and itraconazole interaction sub-studies noted above.  \na. The MDZ interaction sub-study requires 8 evaluable patients.

The second RP2D cohort will be composed of an enriched population of \napproximately 484 patients:\na. A group of ALK marker positive NSCLC patients.  Enrollment is closed with a \ntotal of 154 patients treated.\nb. Three categories of NSCLC patients with MET amplification defined as: \n1) MET/CEP7 ratio of \uf0b35.0 (Group 1): As per the Protocol Administrative \nClarification Letter (PACL) dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-\noff for this group was revised to \u22654.0. As per the PACL dated 11 \nSeptember 2018, this group was closed to further enrollment. The \nremaining 14 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 \nalterations subgroup within the Enriched Other cohort.\n2) \uf04d\uf045\uf054\uf02fCEP7 ratio \uf03e2.2 to <5.0 (Group 2): As per the PACL dated 15 May \n2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-off for this group was revised to >2.2 to \n\uf03c4.0 and this group was closed to further enrollment. The remaining 13 \nenrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations \nsubgroup within the Enriched Other cohort;\n3) MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b31.8 to \uf0a32.2 (Group 3): As per the PACL dated 12 \nOctober 2015, this group was closed to further enrollment.  \nA total of 68 slots are planned for enrollment. As of IRB/EC approval of \nProtocol Amendment #24, enrollment is closed. Further details for the \nMET-amplified NSCLC cohort is provided in Appendix 9.\nc.\nA group of 50 NSCLC patients positive for chromosomal translocations at \nROS1 gene, including but not limited to CD74-ROS1 and SLC34A2-ROS1\nfusion events, will be enrolled.  Enrollment is closed with 50 patients treated.  \nFurther detail for the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort is provided in \nAppendix 10.\nd. Approximately 171 patients with disease with molecular markers (other than \nALK marker positive NSCLC and ROS1 marker positive NSCLC) that may \nconfer sensitivity to PF-02341066 will be enrolled into the \u2018Enriched Other\u2019\ncohort. This cohort also includes NSCLC patients with tumors harboring \nMET Exon 14 alterations. Sponsor approval is required for enrollment into \nthis cohort. Further details for the \u2018Enriched Other\u2019 cohort are provided in \nAppendix 11. \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 65\nAfter IRB/EC approval of Amendment #18 patients with NSCLC that is\npositive for ALK chromosomal translocations or gene amplifications will not \nbe allowed to enter the enriched cohort. As of the PACL dated 07 December \n2017, the remaining 13 open enrollment slots in the Enriched Other cohort \nwere assigned specifically to NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET \nExon 14 alterations rather than the broader Enriched Other cohort.  Thus, the \nEnriched Other cohort will be open only for enrollment of NSCLC patients \nwith MET Exon 14 alterations. As of the Investigator Communication Letter \ndated January 7, 2019, further enrollment of NSCLC patients with tumors \nharboring MET exon 14 alterations is closed.\nALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #1: \ne.\nThis cohort will consist of NSCLC patients who are negative for the ALK \ntranslocation as determined by the ALK break apart FISH assay used in \nProtocols A8081007 and A8081005.  A minimum of 25 to a maximum of \n50 evaluable patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed \nat the RP2D, ie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks.  \nEvery effort will be made to ensure that baseline characteristics for these \npatients are comparable to those of ALK marker positive patients enrolled in \nthe A8081007 trial.  In addition to encouraging ALK marker negative patients\nidentified under the A8081007 study to consider enrollment in the Phase 1 \ntrial, baseline characteristics for patients in the A8081007 study will be \nevaluated in a pooled fashion across treatment groups and enrollment of \npatients in the Phase 1 trial may be adjusted to reflect characteristics on \nspecific variables (eg, gender, age, etc).  However, upon agreement between \nthe Sponsor and Investigator, patients who have similar baseline \ncharacteristics to the ALK positive NSCLC patients in this study may be \nallowed to enter this study.  In order to increase comparability of response \nevaluation between ALK marker negative and ALK marker positive patients, \ntumor scans from ALK marker negative patients enrolled in this trial will be \nevaluated by an independent radiology group. As of the Note to File issued \n25 October 2012, tumor scans from patients enrolled into ALK marker \nnegative NSCLC Cohort #1 will no longer be collected for and submitted to \nan independent radiology laboratory for review. Enrollment is closed with \n47 patients treated.\nf.\nALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #2: This cohort will consist of NSCLC \npatients who are negative for the ALK translocation as determined by the ALK \nbreak apart FISH assay by the central laboratory selected by the Sponsor.  At \nleast 20 patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed at the \nRP2D, ie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks.  \nPatients may have been pre-screened using a local ALK test.  However, only \npatients whose pre-screening ALK test was negative and confirmed negative \nby the central laboratory selected by the Sponsor may be enrolled in this trial.  \nNo molecular testing for MET or ROS1 may be performed prior to patient \nenrollment.  As of the Note to File dated 19 June 2012, the requirement that \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 66\nno molecular testing for MET or ROS1 to occur prior to patient enrollment \nwas removed.  Thus, MET or ROS1 testing may have been performed prior to \npatient entry into this cohort.  However if the test result is either MET or \nROS1 positive, then the patient cannot be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients \nshould, however, have sufficient tumor tissue, ie, 9 slides, if possible, each \ncontaining unstained tissue sections that are 5 microns thick, to be tested for \nROS1 fusion, MET amplification \n \n  The Sponsor will provide tumor shipment \ninstructions for ROS1 and MET testing under separate cover.  Enrollment is \nclosed with 21 patients treated.  Further detail for the ALK marker negative \nNSCLC Cohort #2 is provided in Appendix 8.\nIn addition, if possible, up to 6 patients will undergo pre- and post-dose [18F]-FLT-PET.  \nAlso, if possible, the same patients who have biopsies performed, will undergo \n[18F]-FLT-PET.  A separate sub-study with at least 6 evaluable patients with MET mutation \nor amplification will undergo pre- and post-dose [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET.  With \nthe approval of Amendment #13 by the IRB/EC, no additional patients will undergo PET \nimaging.  Finally, 12 evaluable patients in this cohort will participate in a fed/fast sub-study \n(see below). Clinical sites in Korea will not participate in this sub-study.  Depending upon \nthe overall results from the RP2D cohorts, a different dose/schedule may be tested in \nadditional cohorts.\nFor patients who participate in the fed/fast sub-study, the effect of a high-fat, high-calorie \nbreakfast on PF-02341066 pharmacokinetics will be studied.  Each patient will serve as their \nown control in which PF-02341066 is administered under either \u201cfed\u201d or \u201cfasted\u201d \nconditions on Day -7 and Day 1 of Cycle 1 (morning dose if the BID regimen is employed).  \nPharmacokinetic sampling times are described in Section 7.5.1.1.  The testing order for fed \nversus fasted conditions will be as follows: the first 6 patients to participate in this sub-study \nwill be tested under fed followed by fasted conditions, the next 6 patients will be tested under \nfasted followed by fed conditions.  If patients are receiving PF-02341066 on a BID dosing \nschedule, the evening dose of Day 1 of Cycle 1 will be cancelled.  Patients who have had a \ngastrectomy or have dietary restrictions or adverse events that preclude a 10-hour overnight \nfast or cannot consume the high-fat, high-calorie meal will not be required to participate in\nthis sub-study.  See Section 5.2.3.1 for additional details on the high-fat, high-calorie meal.\nAll tumor scans from ALK marker positive NSCLC patients enrolled in the enriched\npopulation cohort (including ALK marker positive NSCLC patients in the dose escalation \ncohort) will be evaluated by an independent radiology group.  As of the Note to File issued \n25 October 2012, tumor scans from ALK marker positive NSCLC patients will no longer be \ncollected for and submitted to an independent radiology laboratory for review.\nAll tumor scans from ROS1 marker positive NSCLC patients enrolled will be collected and \nsubmitted to an independent radiology laboratory for review until notification is received \nCCI\nCCI\n",

Management of Selected PF-02341066-Related Adverse Events\n5.1.1. Nausea and Emesis\nFor nausea and emesis, treat with standard anti-emetics such as prochlorperazine or \nondansetron.  Taking the medication with food may reduce nausea.  Prophylactic antiemetics\nshould be considered. \n5.1.2. Diarrhea\nFor CTCAE Grade 1 diarrhea, symptomatic care such as loperamide (Imodium\uf0d2) or no \nintervention at investigator judgment. \nFor CTCAE Grade 2 diarrhea, loperamide (4 mg at first onset, then 2 mg every 2-4 hours \nuntil symptom free for 12 hours).  No dose modification unless patient is intolerant or \nsymptom is recurrent. \nFor CTCAE Grade \uf0b33 (despite use of loperamide), treatment should be withheld until \nrecovery to Grade \uf0a31.\n5.1.3. Bradycardia\nConcurrent use of PF-02341066 with other bradycardic agents (eg, beta-blockers, \nnon-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem, clonidine, \ndigoxin) should be avoided to the extent possible, due to the increased risk of symptomatic \nbradycardia. \nHeart rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly.

If a patient has a potential diagnosis of pneumonitis or drug related lung \ninjury, the following evaluations/procedures should be considered to assist or exclude the \ndiagnosis of pneumonitis during this period in the absence of disease progression, other \npulmonary disease, infection or radiation effects:\n\u2022\nA sputum gram stain and culture (induced sputum if needed) bacterial, viral, fungal, \nprotozoal, and mycobacterial pathogens;  \n\u2022\nBlood culture should be performed in febrile patients.  Consider appropriate \nserologies (mycoplasma, legionella, CMV, other viruses, etc.);\n\u2022\nThoracentesis if pleural fluid is present (culture, microbiology, cytology);\n\u2022\nBronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) if appropriate. The BAL fluid \nshould be sent for culture, microbiology and cytology;\n\u2022\nA plasma sample for BNP (B-type Natriuretic peptide) to evaluate for evidence of \nCHF;\n\u2022\nFor Asian patients, a blood sample for \u03b2-D-glucan to evaluate for the presence of \nfungal pneumonia (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii).\nIf clinically appropriate, high dose corticosteroid treatment should be initiated. \nShould the event be fatal an autopsy is highly recommended to confirm/exclude the \ndiagnosis. \nFor any case of drug-related pneumonitis, discontinue PF-02341066 and contact the Sponsor \n(see Table 2b).\n5.1.5. Renal Cyst\nThe development of complex renal cysts has been reported in some patients with NSCLC \ntreated with PF-02341066.  These cysts may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and have \nusually developed within the first several months of starting PF-02341066.  The precise \nnature and significance of these cysts is unclear; however, while no evidence of malignancy \nhas been found based on aspiration of cyst fluid and biopsy in the reported cases, complex \nrenal cysts may be associated with renal malignancy, and thus consultation with a urologist \nor suitable alternate medical expert is recommended.  Active surveillance with appropriate \nimaging (contrast-enhanced CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging) should be \nCCI\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 70\nperformed at the time of the renal cyst diagnosis and thereafter following the same schedule \nas for tumor imaging. Contrast-enhanced CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging \nshould be performed assuring full visualization of the kidneys.  Investigators should also \nreview retrospectively all CT/MRIs for any prior occurrence of complex renal cysts. \nDipstick and urine microscopy should be performed on Day 1 of each cycle.\nTable 2a and Table 2b describe the recommended dose modifications for study \ntreatment-related toxicities prior to Amendment #12 and after Amendment #12, respectively \n(Note: Pneumonitis-related dose modification added with Amendment #15).\nTable 2.\nDose Modifications for PF-02341066 Associated Toxicity\nTable 2a\nDose Modifications for PF-02341066 Associated Toxicity\nToxicity\nGrade 1\nGrade 2\nGrade 3\nGrade 4\nNon-hematologic \nContinue at the \nsame dose level.\nContinue at the same dose \nlevel.\nFor recurrent subjectively \nintolerable toxicity (at \nleast a week interruption \non 2 occasions) that is not \ncontrolled by optimal \nsupportive medication, \nreduce the dose to next \nlower dose level tested.* \nWithhold dose until \ntoxicity is Grade \uf0a31, \nor has returned to \nbaseline, then resume \ntreatment at the same \ndose level, or reduce \nthe dose to next lower \ndose level tested* at \nthe discretion of the \ninvestigator.**\nWithhold dose until \ntoxicity is Grade \n\uf0a31, or has returned \nto baseline, then \nreduce the dose to \nnext lower dose \nlevel tested* and \nresume treatment, \nor discontinue at \nthe discretion of the \ninvestigator.**\nHematologic\nContinue at the \nsame dose level.\nContinue at the same dose \nlevel.\nWithhold dose until \ntoxicity is Grade \uf0a32, \nor has returned to \nbaseline, then resume \ntreatment at the same \ndose level.***\nWithhold dose until \ntoxicity is Grade \n\uf0a32, then reduce the \ndose to next lower \ndose level tested* \nand resume \ntreatment.***\n* If the next lower level is below the first dose level tested in the study (dose level of the first cohort of patients), reduce the \ndose by 50%.\n** Patients who develop grade 4 hyperuricemia or grade 3 hypophosphatemia without clinical symptoms may continue \nstudy treatment without interruption at the discretion of the investigator.

After IRB/EC approval of Protocol Amendment #17, only NSCLC patients will be evaluated for \nadditional specialized ophthalmological testing which includes: refractive error, pupil size, fundus photography, optical coherence \ntomography and intraocular pressure.  These additional tests will be performed at screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, 1 year and \nyearly thereafter and then at 2 to 8 weeks after discontinuation of PF-02341066.  For all other patients, applicable ophthalmologic \nexaminations should be repeated during the study whenever a vision disorder AE is observed or when there is an increase in CTCAE grade \nfrom the previous visit.  As of the Note To File issued 18 March 2016, the following ophthalmologic tests (added in Protocol Amendment \n#17) are no longer required for NSCLC patients: refractive error, pupil size, intraocular pressure, ocular coherence tomography, dilated \nfundus photography.  See Section 7.3.\nEvery effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.\nIn the event of significant toxicity, dosing may be interrupted and/or reduced as described \nbelow.  In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst \ntoxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify their investigators at the first \noccurrence of any adverse event.  \nDose modifications may occur in 2 ways:\n\uf0b7\nWithin a cycle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and dose reduction, if \nrequired, during a given treatment cycle; \n\uf0b7\nIn the next cycle: dose reduction may be required in a subsequent cycle based on \ntoxicity experienced in the previous cycle.\nDose Interruption\nThe study investigator may implement dose suspension and/or reduction in order to ensure \npatient safety; however interruption in treatment should last for no more than 6 weeks.  If a \nlonger interruption is required, discussion with the Sponsor must occur and agreement must \nbe reached between both the Sponsor and Investigator.\nDose Re-Escalation\nDoses reduced for drug-related toxicity should generally not be re-escalated.  However, \nintrapatient re-escalation back one or two dose levels after at least 4 weeks of treatment at the \nreduced dose level may be permitted on a case-by-case basis depending on the clinical setting \nand assessment of risk/benefit ratio after discussion with the Sponsor.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 74\nOverdose Instructions\nIn the event of an overdose, the Sponsor should be contacted to discuss the details of the \noverdose and formulate a clinical management plan. \nNo information regarding overdose of PF-02341066 in humans is available.  No antidote \nexists for the treatment of PF-02341066 overdose.  In the event of an accidental overdose, the \npatient should be monitored for possible signs of toxicity as mentioned above.  As there is no \nspecific antidote for overdose of PF-02341066, general supportive care should be provided. \n5.2. Drug Supplies\n5.2.1. Formulation and Packaging\n5.2.1.1. PF-02341066\nPrior to IRB/EC approval of Amendment #12:\nPF-02341066 is filled in two tone gray capsules containing 10, 50 or 100 mg of study \nmedication for oral administration.  The drug product consists of PF-02341066 in a hard \ngelatin capsule.  The capsules are packaged in HDPE bottles and should be stored at room \ntemperature (15 to 25\uf0b0C) and handled with care.\nFollowing IRB/EC approval of Amendment #12:\nPF-02341066 will also be provided as tablets containing 50 or 100 mg of study drug for oral \nadministration.  The 50 mg tablets are round in shape whereas the 100 mg tablets are oval in \nshape.  The tablets are packaged in HDPE bottles and should be stored at 15 to 30\uf0b0C and \nhandled with care.  PF-02341066 may also be supplied as an oral solution (25 mg/mL) upon \nSponsor agreement and availability of supplies.  The oral solution is buffered, sweetened, and \ngrape-flavored and is packaged in HDPE bottles.  Dosing instructions and storage conditions \nfor the oral solution will be provided under separate cover.\nFollowing IRB/EC approval of Amendment #25 (Japan specific amendment): \nPF-02341066 formulated capsules can also be administered. This capsule formulation has \nbeen shown to be bioequivalent to the tablets and a powder in capsule (PIC). Two capsule \ndosage strengths will be used: 200 mg and 250 mg of PF-02341066 for oral administration.\nThe capsules are packaged in HDPE bottles, should be stored at 1 to 30\uf0b0C and handled with \ncare.\n5.2.1.2. Midazolam (MDZ)\nMDZ syrup (2 mg/mL) for oral administration will be used for patients who will participate \nin the MDZ interaction sub-study.  The drug name and lot number for MDZ should be \nrecorded in Case Report Forms (CRFs).\n5.2.1.3. Rifampin\nSee Appendix 6 for details.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 75\n5.2.1.4. Itraconazole\nSee Appendix 7 for details.\n5.2.2. Preparation and Dispensing\n5.2.2.1. PF-02341066\nThe study medication should be dispensed according to the schedule of treatment \nadministration (Section 5.2.3). Dispensing will be done by a qualified staff member in \nbottles provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule.  The patient/caregiver \nshould be instructed to maintain the product in the bottle provided throughout the course of\ndosing and return the bottle to the site at the next study visit. \nOnly qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to \nthem and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of \nPF-02341066.\nMedication will be provided in bulk containers.  Investigational sites will also be provided \nwith a supply of bottles and non-patient-specific labels.  Site personnel must ensure that \npatients clearly understand the directions for self-medication. Patients should be given \nsufficient supply to last until their next study visit, ie, supplies for one cycle, however; for \npatients who visit the clinic every 2 cycles (after completing 10 cycles), enough supply for \n2 cycles will be provided.\nOnce Amendment #12 is approved by the IRB/EC, all newly enrolled patients will receive \ntablet supplies.  For ongoing patients, tablets will be supplied gradually and eventually \ncompletely replace the capsule.\nPF-02341066 is a cytotoxic agent that must be handled and administered with care.  Patients \nshould be instructed to keep their medication in the bottles provided and not transfer it to any\nother container.  Due to possible unknown hazards associated with topical and \nenvironmental exposure to experimental cytotoxic agents, capsules must not be opened \nand/or emptied into any vehicle for oral ingestion. Capsules or tablets must be swallowed \nintact.  However, PF-02341066 tablets may be dissolved according to specific dosing \ninstructions which will be provided under separate cover after Sponsor approval is granted.  \nAdministration of PF-02341066 through any other means besides orally is not permitted.\nTherefore, if a patient is unable to swallow the study drug intact, then 2 options exist:\n\uf0b7\nWhen available, PF-02341066 may be supplied as an oral solution (25 mg/mL) as \ndescribed in Section 5.2.1.1, or\n\uf0b7\nPF-02341066 tablets may be dissolved according to specific dosing instructions as \nnoted above.\nIn either circumstance, prior approval must be obtained from the Sponsor, and thereafter,\ndosing instructions will be provided under separate cover.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 76\nNote: For patients enrolled in rifampin and itraconazole interaction sub-studies, only the \ntablet formulation of PF-02341066 will be administered from the first dose of PF-02341066 \nuntil the last dose of PF-02341066 when co-administered with rifampin or itraconazole.  \nRefer to Appendix 6 and Appendix 7 for further details.\n5.2.2.2. MDZ\nMidazolam will be dispensed using the manufacturer specified dispensing instructions.  \nQualified personnel will prepare and dispense the MDZ dose in accordance with the current \npackage insert. \n5.2.3. Administration\n5.2.3.1. PF-02341066\nAdministration will be performed on an outpatient basis.  PF-02341066 should be taken with \nat least 8 oz. of water on an empty stomach, ie, patient should refrain from food and \nbeverages (except water) for at least 2 hours prior to dosing and for at least 2 hours after \ndosing.  However, starting on Day 2 of Cycle 2, patients may take PF-02341066 without \nregard to meals.  With the approval of Amendment #14, patients may take PF-02341066 \nwithout regards to meals upon the initiation of treatment unless otherwise indicated.  Patients \nshould be instructed to take their medication at approximately the same time each day and to \nnot take more than the prescribed dose at any time.  However, a variance of up to 12 hours \nfor QD dosing and 6 hours for BID dosing either way is allowed for any given dose, rather \nthan miss a day\u2019s dose.  If a patient misses a day\u2019s dose entirely, they must be instructed not \nto \u201cmake it up\u201d the next day.  If a patient vomits anytime after taking a dose, they must be \ninstructed not to \u201cmake it up,\u201d but to resume subsequent doses the next day as prescribed.  If\na patient inadvertently takes 1 extra dose during a day, the patient should not take the next \ndose of PF-02341066.  Patients should also be instructed to swallow the trial medication \nwhole and not chew the capsule or tablet prior to swallowing.  No capsule or tablet should be \ningested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact.  Doses may be modified according to \nTable 2.  The study investigator may implement dose suspension and/or reduction in order to \nensure patient safety.\nFor patients participating in the food effect study, PF-02341066 will be administered \nfollowing an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.  For those patients scheduled to receive the \n\u201cfed\u201d treatment, a high-fat, high-caloric breakfast will be provided and must be consumed \nover 30 minutes.  PF-02341066 will be administered with approximately 8 oz of water \n30 minutes after the start of the meal.  No additional food will be allowed until at least \n2 hours post-dose.  For patients scheduled to receive the \u201cfasted\u201d treatment, PF-02341066 \nwill be administered with 8 oz of water.  No food will be allowed for an additional 2 hours \npost-dose.  For either treatment day, water will be allowed ad libitum.  A high-fat \n(approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal) and high-calorie (approximately \n800-1000 calories) meal is recommended as a test meal.  This test meal should derive\napproximately 150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, \nrespectively.  An example test meal would be two eggs fried in butter, two strips of bacon \n(may be replaced with ham or cheese of similar caloric content), two slices of toast with \nbutter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes and eight ounces of whole-fat milk.  However, it \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 77\nis understood that some patients may not be able to consume the entire meal. Study staff \nshould record the % of the standard breakfast that is consumed.\n5.2.3.2. MDZ \nIn the MDZ interaction sub-study, patients will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on \nDay -7 and will receive another single 2-mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with \nPF-02341066 on Cycle 2 Day 1. \nPatients should refrain from food and beverages (except water) 8 hours prior to MDZ dosing \nand 2 hours after dosing.  Qualified personnel will administer MDZ syrup (1 mL to provide \n2 mg of MDZ) using an oral disposable syringe followed by 8 oz. of ambient temperature \nwater.  Additionally, to standardize conditions for PK sampling, patients should refrain from \nlying down (except as needed for vital sign and ECG assessments) in the 2-hour period \nfollowing MDZ administration.\n5.2.3.3. Rifampin\nPlease see Appendix 6 for details.\n5.2.3.4. Itraconazole\nPlease see Appendix 7 for details.\n5.2.4. Patient Compliance\nPatients will be required to return all bottles of study drug at the beginning of each cycle.  \nThe number of capsules or tablets remaining will be documented and recorded.  Patients who\nare considered non-compliant will be withdrawn from study (see Section 6.1).\nAs of the Note to File (NTF) dated 08 February 2018, the following guidance was issued to \nsites regarding dosing compliance:\nStudy Treatment (Crizotinib) Dosing\nReport as\nProtocol Deviation\nReport as\nMedication Error\nPatient unintentionally misses a total of < 20% \nof his/her doses within a given cycle \nNo\nNo\nPatient unintentionally misses a total of \u226520% \nof his/her doses within a given cycle\nYes\nYes\nPatient unintentionally takes 1 extra dose \nwithin a given cycle\nYes\nNo\nPatient unintentionally takes >1 extra dose with \na given cycle\nYes\nYes\nPlease note, unintentional missed or extra doses should be investigated further with the \npatient to determine other potential reasons for the missed or extra doses (ie, whether due to a \npossible adverse event), as well as how to minimize their reoccurrence\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 78\n5.3. Drug Storage \nThe investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all study \ndrugs, ie, PF-02341066, rifampin and itraconazole, are stored in a secured area with \ncontrolled access under recommended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable \nregulatory requirements.\nPF-02341066 should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the drug label.  \nSee the Investigator\u2019s Brochure for storage conditions of the product.\nStorage conditions stated in the single reference safety document (Investigator\u2019s Brochure) \nwill be superseded by the storage conditions stated in the labeling.\nReturned medication for PF-02341066 should be stored separately from medication that \nneeds to be dispensed.  \nSite systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a \nminimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as \napplicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products). This should be \ncaptured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study.  Even for \ncontinuous monitoring systems, a log or site procedure which ensures active daily evaluation \nfor excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum \ntemperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last \nevaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum \ntemperature for all non-working days upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the \ntemperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, \nshould be regularly inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order.  \nAny excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor \nupon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the \nstorage conditions as described in the labelling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the \nstorage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the \nSponsor. Once an excursion is identified, PF-02341066 must be quarantined and not used \nuntil the Sponsor provides documentation of permission to use it.  It will not be considered a \nprotocol deviation if the Sponsor approves the use of the investigational product after the \ntemperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to Sponsor approval will be \nconsidered a protocol deviation.\nSpecific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be \nprovided to the site. \nReceipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where \nthe product(s) are briefly out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not \nconsidered excursions. More specific details will be provided to the sites separately.\nSite staff will instruct patients on the proper storage requirements for take home medications.\nIf an excursion is identified for itraconazole, the Sponsor should be contacted.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 79\nThe investigational product manual should be referenced for any additional guidance on \nstorage conditions and actions to be taken when conditions are outside the specified range.\nThe above requirements are to be implemented upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21 if \nnot previously implemented.\nCapsules: PF-02341066 investigational medication should be stored at 15-25\uf0b0C (room \ntemperature).

Concomitant Radiotherapy or Surgery\nPalliative radiotherapy to specific sites of disease is permitted if considered medically \nnecessary by the treating physician.  PF-02341066 treatment should be interrupted during \npalliative radiotherapy \u2013 stopping 1 day before and resuming treatment 1 day after.  \nIrradiated lesions will be considered not evaluable for response but still can be used to assess \ndisease progression.  The intensities, number, and dates of doses received for allowed \npalliative radiotherapy should be recorded on the appropriate CRFs. \nThe effect of PF-02341066 on wound healing is not known and has not been investigated; \ntherefore, caution is still advised on theoretical grounds (potential antiangiogenic effect) for \nany surgical procedures during the study.  The appropriate interval of time between surgery\nand PF-02341066 required to minimize the risk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has\nnot been determined.  In the event elective surgery is necessary during study participation, \nPF-02341066 dosing should be stopped 48 hours before surgery and resumed no sooner than \n48 hours after surgery.  Postoperatively, the decision to reinitiate PF-02341066 treatment \nshould be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound healing and recovery from \nsurgery.\n6.

Once Amendment #13 is \nactivated, the Day-7 blood collections will be eliminated.  This change is only for \nnon-Asian patients.  Asian patients will follow Instruction #4.  After Amendment #16 \nis IRB/EC approved, the Day -7 blood draws will be eliminated for all patients.\n4. For patients who are enrolled in clinical sites in Korea, a full pharmacokinetic \nprofile of PF-02341066 will be obtained after dosing on Day -7 at the following \ntimes: 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 24 and 48 hours post-dose.  In addition, blood \nsamples will be obtained at any two time points of the following: 72, 96, 120 and \n144 hours post-dose.  Blood samples for PF-02341066 pharmacokinetics will be also \nobtained on Day 1 of Cycle 1 at predose and 2-8 hours post-dose, and Day 15 of \nCycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycle 2 at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 \nand 24 hours post dose.

Once Amendment #16 is IRB/EC approved, all patients enrolled \nin clinical sites in Korea will follow the updated Instruction #3.\nFor all cohorts except for the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohorts, in order to assess \npharmacokinetics in patients receiving long-term treatment with PF-02341066, two PK \nsampling points (pre-dose and 4-8 hours [2-8 hours as of May 1, 2007] post-dose) will be \nobtained on Day 15 of Cycle 2, Day 1 of Cycle 3 and Day 1 of subsequent cycles (up to \nCycle 5) for all patients.\nFor the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort, plasma PK samples will be collected prior to \nmorning dosing on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 and 5 and 2-6 hours following dosing on Day 1 of \nCycles 1, 3 and 5.  Following IRB/EC approval of Amendment #18, patients in the RP2D \nMET-amplified NSCLC and Enriched Other cohorts and ALK marker negative NSCLC \nRP2D Cohort #2 will have PK samples collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3 and 5 at pre-dose \n(0 hour) and 2-6 hours post-dose.  In addition, for patients in the MET-amplified NSCLC, \nROS1 marker positive NSCLC and Enriched Other cohorts, a PK sample should be taken \naround the time that disease progression is confirmed as long as the patient is still on \nPF-02341066 treatment.  \nFurther details for the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort #2 are provided in Appendix 8.\nFurther details for the MET-amplified NSCLC Cohort are provided in Appendix 9.\nFurther details for the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort are provided in Appendix 10.\nFurther details for the Enriched Other cohort are provided in Appendix 11. \nIn addition to samples mentioned above, additional blood samples for PK evaluation may be \nrequested from patients experiencing unexpected or serious adverse events; with evidence of \ndisease progression; or with other events where PK sampling is considered useful (upon \nagreement between investigator and Sponsor).  More than one PK sample per patient may be \ncollected throughout the study; however the total blood volume of additional PK samples \ncollected per patient should not exceed 15 mL (ie, no more than 5, 3 mL samples). As of \nIRB/EC approval of Protocol Amendment #23, the total blood volume of additional PK \nsamples collected per patient should not exceed 20 mL (ie, no more than 5, 4 mL samples).\nBlood samples (4 mL) for PF-02341066 pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected into \nappropriately labeled collection tubes containing KEDTA at protocol-specified times.  Once \ncollected, samples should be processed immediately and kept out of direct sunlight due to the \nlight sensitive nature of PF-02341066.  Blood samples will be placed immediately on \nice-bath and centrifuged at approximately 1700 g for 10 minutes at 4\uf0b0C.  Plasma samples \nwill be stored in appropriately labeled tubes at approximately -20\u00b0C within 1 hour of \ncollection.  Details regarding the sample preparation will be provided in the Laboratory \nManual.\nUpon IRB/EC approval of Protocol Amendment #24, blood samples for PK analysis will no \nlonger be collected.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 91\n7.5.1.2. Plasma Pharmacokinetic Assessment for MDZ\nIn the MDZ interaction sub-study, a pharmacokinetic profile of MDZ will be collected after a \nsingle oral MDZ dose on Day \u20137 (lead-in period) and Cycle 2 Day 1 at the following time \npoints: 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 24 hours post dose. \nBlood samples (2 mL) for MDZ pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected into appropriately \nlabeled collection tubes containing sodium heparin at protocol-specified times.  Blood \nsamples must be placed immediately into an ice-water bath and centrifuged at approximately \n1700 g for 10 minutes at 4\uf0b0C prior to storage.  The plasma (approximately 1 mL) will be\nstored in appropriately labeled screw-capped polypropylene tubes at \uf0a3-20\uf0b0C within 1 hour of \nsample collection.  Details regarding the sample preparation will be provided in the Study \nManual. Note: Clinical sites in Korea and Australia will not participate in the MDZ\ninteraction sub-study. \n7.5.2. Urine for Analysis of PF-02341066\nIn the RP2D midazolam interaction cohort, urine samples will be collected for 24 hours after \nPF-02341066 dosing on Cycle 1 Day 15 to measure PF-02341066 concentrations, and \nthereby determine the renal elimination of PF-02341066 from the body.  Metabolites of \nPF-02341066 may also be measured in the urine samples.  Urine will be collected on Cycle 1 \nDay 15 over the following intervals: 0 to 4 hours, 4 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours postdose.  \nPatients will empty their bladder just prior to dosing on Cycle 1 Day 15. \nAt the end of each urine collection period, the total volume will be measured and recorded.  \nVoided urine should be collected in an amber container and protected from direct light.  The\nurine will then be mixed thoroughly and a 20 mL aliquot will be withdrawn for the potential \nmeasurement of drug concentrations.  The sample will be protected from light and frozen at \napproximately -20\u00b0C. \n7.5.3. Plasma for PF-02341066 Metabolite Profiling\nAdditional 5-mL blood samples will be collected at 4-8 hours post dose on Cycle 1 Day 15 in \nthe RP2D midazolam interaction cohort for metabolite profiling.\nDetail collection procedure will be provided in the study manual.\n7.5.4. Blood Sample for Pharmacogenomics\nBlood samples for genotyping will be examined to assess the impact of allelic variants of \ndrug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters.  Additionally, these samples may also be used \nfor retrospective evaluation of additional genetic variants associated with variation in \npharmacokinetics (PKs) or to explore the relationship with AEs.  Samples will be retained \nfor a period of up to 3 years following the submission of the final clinical study report (CSR).\nA 4-mL blood sample will be collected from each subject into a plastic dipotassium \nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA) tube at times specified in the SCHEDULE OF \nACTIVITIES section of the protocol.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 92\n \n \nThe pharmacogenomic (PGx) samples must be processed and shipped as indicated in the \ninstructions provided to the investigator site to maintain sample integrity. Any deviations \nfrom the PGx processing steps, including any actions taken, must be documented and \nreported to the Sponsor. On a case-by-case basis, the Sponsor may make a determination as \nto whether sample integrity has been compromised. Any sample deemed outside of \nestablished stability, or of questionable integrity, will be considered a protocol deviation.\nFor patients enrolled in clinical sites in Japan as part of the Enriched Other Cohort, blood \nsample collection for pharmacogenomics is optional.\n7.5.5. Urine Sample for 6 beta-Hydroxycortisol/Cortisol (6\u03b2-OHC/C) Ratio \nA midstream morning spot urine sample (10 mL) will be collected into an appropriately \nlabelled plastic screw topped collection container prior to dosing of any drug on Day 1 of \nCycle 1, Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycle 2.  Urine samples should be frozen \nimmediately and stored at -20\u00b0C. The urinary 6 beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol (6\u03b2-OHC/C) \nratio will be determined to evaluate the potential of CYP3A4 induction.

[18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET Imaging (RP2D enriched population cohort \nonly)\nIf possible, at least 6 evaluable patients with MET mutations/amplification will be enrolled \ninto the imaging portion of the RP2D enriched population cohort.  These patients will \nundergo [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET imaging. Also, if possible, the same patients \nthat have pre- and post-dose biopsies will undergo PET imaging. The screening\n[18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET will be used to determine evaluable index lesions for \neach patient. Tumor background ratios (TBR) and development of new sites of abnormality \nwill be recorded.  A patient will be considered evaluable if they have 2 or more baseline \ntarget lesions each identified by both [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET imaging.  All \nevaluable lesions must have a baseline [18F]-FLT-PET SUV of at least 2, and a baseline \n[18F]-FDG-PET SUV \u22653.5 (liver) or \u22655 (non-liver). Results of the PET sub-study will be \nscored according to the methods developed by the American College of Radiology Imaging \nNetwork (ACRIN; http://www.acrin.org/petcorelab.html).  These assessments will be \nperformed as per the Schedule of Activities.

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n8.1. Adverse Events\nAll observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal \nrelationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following \nsections. \nFor all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to \ndetermine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for \nclassification as a serious adverse event (SAE) (see Section 8.6) requiring immediate \nnotification to Pfizer or its designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient \ninformation should be obtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the adverse \nevent.  The investigator is required to assess causality.  Follow-up by the investigator may be\nrequired until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the \ninvestigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.\nAs part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event \nthat is determined by the Sponsor to be serious will be reported by the Sponsor as an SAE.  \nTo assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from \nthe investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical \nstudy.\n8.2. Reporting Period\nFor SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begin from the \ntime that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient\u2019s \nparticipation in the clinical trial, ie, prior to undergoing any trial-related procedure and/or \nreceiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last \nadministration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient\nafter the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the \ninvestigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the \ninvestigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational \nproduct are to be reported to the Sponsor.\nAdverse events (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF)\nfrom the time the patient has taken at least one dose of investigational product through the \npatient\u2019s last visit.\nIf a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period for \nnon-serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be \nreported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last dose of \ninvestigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment.\n8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event\nAn adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient \nadministered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 95\nrelationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of adverse events include but are not \nlimited to:  \n\uf0b7\nAbnormal test findings;\n\uf0b7\nClinically significant symptoms and signs;\n\uf0b7\nChanges in physical examination findings;\n\uf0b7\nHypersensitivity;\n\uf0b7\nDrug abuse;\n\uf0b7\nDrug dependency.\nAdditionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:\n\uf0b7\nDrug overdose;\n\uf0b7\nDrug withdrawal;\n\uf0b7\nDrug misuse;\n\uf0b7\nDrug interactions;\n\uf0b7\nExtravasation;\n\uf0b7\nExposure during pregnancy (EDP);\n\uf0b7\nExposure via breastfeeding;\n\uf0b7\nMedication error;\n\uf0b7\nOccupational exposure;\n\uf0b7\nWorsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under trial should be reported as\nadverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed \nby measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be \nreported as adverse events.\n8.4. Medication Errors\nMedication errors may result, in this study, from the administration or consumption of the \nwrong product, by the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  \nSuch medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication \nerror case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page, and \non the SAE form when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the Sponsor\nshould be notified immediately.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 96\nMedication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, \nincluding:\n\uf0b7\nMedication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product;\n\uf0b7\nPotential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do \nor do not involve the participating patient.\nWhether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the \ninvestigator, the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the adverse \nevent (AE) page and, if applicable, any associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.\n8.5. Abnormal Test Findings\nThe criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as \nan adverse event are as follows: \n\uf0b7\nTest result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, \nand/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result leads to a change in trial dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose \nadjustments) or discontinuation from the trial, significant additional concomitant drug\ntreatment, or other therapy, and/or\n\uf0b7\nTest result is considered to be an adverse event by the investigator or Sponsor.\nMerely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not \nconstitute an adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does \nnot require reporting as an adverse event.\n8.6. Serious Adverse Events\nA serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:\n\uf0b7\nResults in death;\n\uf0b7\nIs life-threatening (immediate risk of death);\n\uf0b7\nRequires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;\n\uf0b7\nResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the \nability to conduct normal life functions);\n\uf0b7\nResults in congenital anomaly/birth defect.\n\uf0b7\nProgression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of \nprogression) should not be reported as serious adverse events unless the outcome is \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 97\nfatal within the safety reporting period.  Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of \ndisease progression should not be reported as a serious adverse event.  If the \nmalignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the safety reporting period, \nthen the event leading to death must be recorded as an adverse event and as a serious \nadverse event with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)\nGrade 5 (see the section on Severity Assessment).\nMedical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important \nmedical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or \nresult in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize \nthe patient, or may require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse event outcomes, \nthe important medical event should be reported as serious.\nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for \nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; \nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse.\n8.6.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events \nThere are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported by the \ninvestigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety\ndatabase (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements). \n8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury\nAbnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nlevels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria \noutlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of \ndrug-induced liver injury (potential Hy\u2019s Law cases) and should always be considered \nimportant medical events.\nThe threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury \ndepends on the patient\u2019s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Patients who \npresent with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to \ndefinitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:\n\uf0b7\nPatients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range\nwho subsequently present with AST or ALT values \uf0b33 times the upper limit of \nnormal (x ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value \uf0b32 x ULN with no evidence of \nhemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value \uf0a32 x ULN or not available. \n\uf0b7\nFor patients with pre-existing AST OR ALT OR total bilirubin values above the \nupper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition \nmentioned above:\n\uf0b7\nFor patients with preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal \nrange; AST or ALT values \uf0b32 times the baseline values and \uf0b33 x ULN, or\n\uf0b38 x ULN (whichever is smaller).\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 98\n\uf0b7\nConcurrent with\n\uf0b7\nFor patients with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: \nTotal bilirubin level increased from baseline by an amount of at least 1 x ULN \nor if the value reaches \uf0b33 x ULN (whichever is smaller).\nThe patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, \npreferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should \ninclude laboratory tests, a detailed history and physical assessment.  The possibility of \nhepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered.  In addition to repeating \nmeasurements of AST and ALT and total bilirubin, laboratory tests should also include \nalbumin, creatine kinase, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), \nprothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, alkaline \nphosphatase and acetaminophen and/or protein adduct levels.  A detailed history, including \nrelevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and \nsupplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel \nhistory, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver \nor allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute \nhepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted.  All \ncases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no \nother cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be \nconsidered potential Hy\u2019s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the \ninvestigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy\u2019s \nLaw cases should be reported as serious adverse events.\n8.7. Hospitalization\nHospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or \nequivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also \nincludes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric \nwing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a \ntuberculosis unit).  An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; \nhowever, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical \nimportance.\nHospitalization does not include the following:\n\uf0b7\nRehabilitation facilities;\n\uf0b7\nHospice facilities;\n\uf0b7\nRespite care (eg, caregiver relief);\n\uf0b7\nSkilled nursing facilities;\n\uf0b7\nNursing homes;\n\uf0b7\nSame day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 99\nHospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical \nadverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include: \n\uf0b7\nAdmission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the \ndevelopment of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition \n(eg, for work-up of persistent pre-treatment lab abnormality);\n\uf0b7\nSocial admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);\n\uf0b7\nAdministrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);\n\uf0b7\nProtocol-specified admission during a clinical trial (eg, for a procedure required by \nthe trial protocol);\n\uf0b7\nOptional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical adverse event (eg, for \nelective cosmetic surgery);\n\uf0b7\nHospitalization for observation without a medical AE;\n\uf0b7\nPre-planned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline \ndocumentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;\n\uf0b7\nAdmission exclusively for the administration of blood products.\nDiagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not \nbe reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was \nperformed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an \nacute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as \nthe adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the \nadverse event.\n8.8. Severity Assessment\nIf required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the following \ndefinitions of severity in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 to describe the maximum intensity of the \nadverse event.  If the event is serious, the CTCAE grade reported in the adverse event CRF \nmust be consistent with the description of CTCAE grade included in the narrative section of \nthe serious adverse event report. \nGRADE\nClinical Description of Severity\n0\nNo Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in \nthe Version 3.0 CTCAE document but may be used in certain \ncircumstances.)\n1\nMILD Adverse Event\n2\nMODERATE Adverse Event\n3\nSEVERE Adverse Event\n4\nLIFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 100\n5\nDEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event\nNote the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe \nevent is not necessarily a serious adverse event.  For example, a headache may be severe \n(interferes significantly with patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious \nunless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.\n8.9. Causality Assessment\nThe investigator\u2019s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events (serious \nand non-serious): the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as \nappropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting \nrequirements, if applicable.  An investigator\u2019s causality assessment is the determination of \nwhether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or \ncontributed to an adverse event; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a \ncausal relationship should be provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not \ninvestigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as \u201crelated to \ninvestigational product\u201d for reporting purposes as defined by the Sponsor (see the section on \nReporting Requirements).  If the investigator's causality assessment is \u201cunknown but not \nrelated to investigational product\u201d, this should be clearly documented on trial records.\nIn addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with trial \nprocedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and \nCRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse \nevent reporting requirements, if applicable.\n8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy\nFor both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during \npregnancy occurs if:\n1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been \nexposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational \nproduct; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or \nbeing exposed to the investigational product;\nAn example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with \na Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has \nbeen exposed to chemotherapeutic products).\n2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the \ninvestigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed \nduring his partner\u2019s pregnancy.\nIf any trial patient or trial patient\u2019s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the trial \npatient\u2019s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this \ninformation to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form \nand Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE \nhas occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 101\nexposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant \nand has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EDP \nsupplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred \nand within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include \nthe anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of \npregnancy).\nFollow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for\nall EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until\ncompletion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up \nto the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the \nneonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for \ntermination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the \nterminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test \nfindings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).\nIf the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for a serious adverse event (ie, ectopic \npregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital \nanomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal \ndeath]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.\nAdditional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as serious adverse events \nfollows: \n\uf0b7\n\u201cSpontaneous abortion\u201d includes miscarriage and missed abortion.\n\uf0b7\nNeonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard \nto causality, as serious adverse events.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should \nbe reported as serious adverse events when the investigator assesses the infant death \nas related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product.\nAdditional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the \ninvestigator.  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis \n(eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal \nexposure, the investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of\nInformation Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source \ndocuments that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to \nprovide to his partner.\n8.11. Occupational Exposure\nAn occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person \n(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the \nproduct, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.\nAn occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the \ninvestigator\u2019s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an \nassociated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study, \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 102\nthe information is not reported on a Case Report Form (CRF), however a copy of the \ncompleted SAE report form is maintained in the investigator site file.\n8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also the Section on Patient Withdrawal)\nWithdrawal due to adverse events should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other \ncauses, according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the \nappropriate adverse event CRF page. \nWhen a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the serious adverse event must be reported in \naccordance with the reporting requirements defined below.\n8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information\nThe investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events \nspontaneously reported by the trial patient.  In addition, each trial patient will be questioned \nabout adverse events.\n8.14. Reporting Requirements\nEach adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse \nevent.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and \ninternational regulations, as appropriate.\n8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nIf a serious adverse event occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator \nawareness of the event. \nIn particular, if the serious adverse event is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer \nmust be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information.  \nThis timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously\nforwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of \nexposure during pregnancy, exposure via breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.\nIn the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious \nadverse event immediately (eg, if an outpatient trial patient initially seeks treatment \nelsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and \ndocument the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.\nFor all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information \nto Pfizer in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an \ninvestigator may be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in \nan expedited fashion.  This information collected for serious adverse events is more detailed \nthan that captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, this will include a \ndescription of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical \nassessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Information on \nother possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines and/or illnesses \nmust be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings \nmust be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated representative. \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 103\n8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements\nAll adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  It should be \nnoted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the \nadverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a \nconsistent manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms.  \nAdverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as \non the form for collection of serious adverse event information.\n8.14.3. Sponsor\u2019s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities\nAEs reporting, including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be carried out \nin accordance with applicable local regulations.\n9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS\n9.1. Sample Size Determination\nUp to approximately 600 patients will be enrolled in the study including patients in the dose \nescalation and RP2D cohorts see Figure 1.  With Sponsor written approval and IRB/EC \nnotification, 10 to 15 additional patients may be enrolled (for a total overall enrollment of \napproximately 580 patients) to reach the target enrollment of approximately 40 to 50 NSCLC \npatients with tumor harboring MET Exon 14 alterations and approximately 20 to 25 male \npatients for hypogonadism evaluation in the event that overall enrollment is achieved prior \nto reaching these targets.\n9.1.1. Dose Escalation Phase\nThe number of patients to be enrolled in the dose escalation phase of this study will depend \nupon the observed safety profile and study objectives, which will determine the number of \npatients per dose level, the number of dose escalations and the number of cohorts.\nIt is anticipated that a total of approximately 70 patients will be enrolled in the dose \nescalation phase of this study to determine both the QD MTD and the BID MTD. \nThe operating characteristics for the dose escalation part of this study design are shown in\nTable 3, which provides the probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each \nunderlying true DLT rate.  For example, for a toxicity that occurs in 5% of patients, there is \na greater than 95% probability of escalating.  Conversely, for a common toxicity that occurs \nwith a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is <5%.\nTable 3.\nProbability of Escalation to the Next Dose for Each True Underlying DLT \nRate at a Dose Level\nTrue Underlying DLT \nRate\n5%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\nProbability of Escalating \nDose\n0.97\n0.91\n0.71\n0.49\n0.31\n0.17\n0.08\n0.03\n0.01\n0.001\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 104\nTable 4 shows the probability of failing to observe toxicity in a sample size of 3 or 6 patients \ngiven various true underlying toxicity rates.  For example, with 6 patients, the probability of \nfailing to observe toxicity occurring at least 40% of the time is less than 5%.\nTable 4.\nProbability of Failing to Observe Toxicity (at Least One DLT Given the True \nUnderlying DLT Rate) at a Dose Level\nTrue Underlying DLT Rate 5%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\nProbability of Failing to \nObserve Toxicity, N=3\n0.86\n0.73\n0.51\n0.34\n0.22\n0.13\n0.064\n0.027\n0.008\n0.001\nProbability of Failing to \nObserve Toxicity, N=6 \n0.74\n0.53\n0.26\n0.12\n0.047\n0.016\n0.0041\n<0.001\n<0.001 <0.001\n9.1.2. RP2D Midazolam Interaction Cohort\nEight evaluable patients will be required for the MDZ interaction study in the RP2D cohort.  \nThe effect of multiple doses of PF-02341066 on MDZ will be evaluated by estimating the \nAUC0-last ratio of MDZ in presence of PF-02341066 and MDZ alone.  Based on data from \nprevious single dose MDZ studies conducted at Pfizer, it is estimated that the within-patient\ncoefficient of variation (CV) for the AUC0-\u221edata is 25%.  The standard deviation of the \ndifference in log-transformed data is then estimated to be 0.348 [(sqrt 2) \n*(sqrt(ln(1+CV2)))].  If PF-02341066 increases MDZ AUC0-\u221eby 2 fold (a 100% increase), \nthen 8 patients will ensure that the width of the 90% confidence interval for the ratio will be \nno longer than 1.12, with 80% probability (see Table 5).  A probable 90% confidence \ninterval is calculated to be: (1.52, 2.64).  The sample size is calculated using a paired t-test \n(nQuery, Version 4.0). \nTable 5.\nExpected Precision for Effect of PF-02341066 on MDZ (90% CI, 80% \ncoverage probability, 25% CV)\nSample Size\nEstimated Ratio\nProbable CI, \nLower Limit\nProbable CI, Upper \nLimit\nProbable CI Width\n8\n1.3\n0.987\n1.713\n0.726\n1.5\n1.138\n1.976\n0.838\n2.0\n1.518\n2.635\n1.117\n9.1.3. RP2D Enriched Population Cohort\nIt is anticipated that approximately 484 patients will be enrolled into the RP2D enriched \npopulation cohort.  Inclusion in this cohort is based on the inclusion criteria described in \nSection 4.1 and in Appendix 8 for ALK marker negative NSCLC patients, Appendix 9 for \npatients with MET-amplified NSCLC, Appendix 10 for ROS1 marker positive NSCLC \npatients and Appendix 11 for the Enriched Other cohort which includes patients with disease \nwith molecular markers (other than ALK marker positive NSCLC, ROS1 marker positive\nNSCLC and MET-amplified NSCLC) that may confer sensitivity to PF-02341066.  Two \nsub-studies will also be included in this cohort: (1) [18F]-FLT-PET and (2) food effect.  First, \napproximately 6 patients will participate in a [18F]FLT-PET sub-study which should be \nsufficient to identify at least a 15% decline in standardized uptake value (SUV) compared to \nbaseline. \n \n Second, \nCCI\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 105\nfor the food effect sub-study, twelve patients will provide at least 80% power to detect at\nleast a 2-fold in the AUC or Cmax between fed and fasting drug administration (assumes an\nintrapatient CV of 10% for AUC and Cmax).\n9.1.3.1. ALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohorts\n9.1.3.1.1. ALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #1\nThe main objective of this ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort is to evaluate the objective \nresponse in this group of patients and to compare with the objective response observed from \nALK marker positive NSCLC patients enrolled in Study A8081007 and/or Study A8081005, \nas appropriate.  Depending on the recruitment for the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort, \npatients with more than one previous treatment may be enrolled.  Response to PF-02341066 \namong ALK marker negative patients is expected to be low (to date no objective responses \nwere observed in the unselected population in this study).  Therefore, the subset of ALK \nmarker negative patients in this cohort will be first limited to a total of 25 patients.\nIf \uf0a33 objective responses (CR or PR) are observed in the first 25 ALK marker negative \npatients, no additional ALK marker negative NSCLC patients will be enrolled into this trial. \nWith 25 patients and exactly 3 objective responses, the 90% exact confidence interval (CI) \n(3%, 28%) around the observed response rate (12%) will not overlap with the 90% CI \naround the assumed estimate of 40% for ALK marker positive patients (assuming that \n159 ALK marker positive patients are enrolled in the PF-02341066 arm of Study A8081007).  \nOf note, the patient population in the current trial has been heavily pre-treated with a \nmedian number of 3 previous systemic therapies and the observed objective response rate \n(ORR) for the ALK marker positive NSCLC group is ~60%.\nIf >3 objective responses are observed among the 25 ALK marker negative patients, \nadditional patients may be enrolled in this trial as noted in Table 6.\nTable 6.\nPower Calculation for ALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #1\nResponses in\nFirst 25 \nALK - Patients\nAdditional\nALK - Patients to \nbe Enrolled\nTotal \nALK - Patients \nin this Trial\nExact 90% CI * \nAround ORR\n(column 1/ column \n3 x 100)\nExact 90% CI Around \n40% ORR Assumed for \n160 ALK + Patients\n(Protocol A8081007)\n4\n5\n30\n(5%, 28%)\n(34%, 47%)\n5\n10\n35\n(6%, 28%)\n(34%, 47%)\n6\n15\n40\n(7%, 27%)\n(34%, 47%)\n*Assumes that no responses are observed after additional ALK marker negative patients are enrolled in this \ntrial\nIf \uf0b37 responses are observed among the first 25 ALK marker negative patients, then no \nadditional patients will be enrolled beyond 40 until read out of study A8081007 study results.\n9.1.3.1.2. ALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #2\nIn order to further characterize the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in ALK marker \nnegative NSCLC patients, at least 20 patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  These \npatients may have been pre-screened by a local ALK test but only those who were determined \nto have ALK-negative NSCLC may be eligible for enrollment.  The results of the negative \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 106\nlocal test must be confirmed by the central laboratory before entry into the study.  No testing \nfor ROS1 or MET may be performed prior to patient enrollment.  As of the Note to File dated \n19 June 2012, the requirement that no molecular testing for MET or ROS1 to occur prior to\nenrollment was removed.  However, if MET or ROS1 testing was performed prior to patient \nenrollment and the test result for either MET or ROS1 was positive, then the patient could \nnot be enrolled onto this cohort.\nFurther details for the ALK marker negative NSCLC Cohort #2 are provided in Appendix 8.\n9.1.3.2. MET-Amplified NSCLC Cohort\nIn order to further evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 associated with MET\namplification, patients with MET-amplified NSCLC will be enrolled into one of the \nfollowing categories:\n\uf0b7\nHigh Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b35.0; Group 1): As per \nthe PACL dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-off for this group was revised \nto \u22654.0). As per the PACL dated 11 September 2018, this group was closed to further \nenrollment. The remaining 14 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 \nalterations subgroup within the Enriched Other cohort.\n\uf0b7\nMedium Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio >2.2 to <5; Group \n2): As per the PACL dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-off for this group \nwas revised to >2.2 to \uf03c4.0 and this group was closed to further enrollment. The \nremaining 13 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations \nsubgroup within the Enriched Other cohort; \n\uf0b7\nLow Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b31.8 to \uf0a32.2; Group 3):  \nAs per the PACL dated 12 October 2015, this group was closed to further enrollment.\nFor each category, an ORR of 10% was considered to be uninteresting for further study for \nthis category with 30% considered interesting for further exploration.  Using a Simon optimal \ntwo-stage design with alpha=0.05 and 80% power, a test of the null hypothesis that p \n\uf0a310% versus the alternative p \uf0b330% requires 10 evaluable patients in the first stage.  If \n\uf0a31 objective response (CR or PR) is observed in the first 10 patients for any category, no \nadditional patients in that category will be enrolled.  If 2 or more objective responses are \nobserved in the first stage for any category, the first stage may be expanded by enrolling \n19 additional patients in that category.  However, upon completion and evaluation of the first \nstage, a decision will be made whether or not to expand to the second stage in any of the \n3 categories investigated.  Within a category, if >5 objectives responses are observed, the \nnull hypothesis will be rejected. \nAs of a PACL issued June 27, 2014, 4 objective responses were observed in the High Level \nMET Gene Amplification category and the cohort was expanded to an additional 19 patients, \nfor a total of 29-31 patients.  As of a PACL issued October 28, 2014, 2 objective responses \nwere observed in the Medium Level MET Gene Amplified category and the cohort was \nexpanded to an additional 19 patients, for a total of 29-31 patients.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 107\nFurther details for the MET-amplified NSCLC cohort are provided in Appendix 9.\nTo increase the likelihood of achieving the target enrollment of approximately 20 to \n25 evaluable male patients with hypogonadism testing in a timely manner, the Sponsor \ndecided to close enrollment of patients into the MET low amplification NSCLC category \n(MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b31.8 to \uf0a32.2) due to slow enrollment, effective as of the Protocol \nAdministrative Clarification Letter dated 12 October 2015.  Thus, the remaining unused \nenrollment slots (estimated to be approximately 28: 9 from Simon first-stage and 19 from \nSimon second-stage) was transferred to the Enriched Other cohort.  With Sponsor approval \nand IRB/EC notification, other conditions including, but not limited to, slow enrollment in \nthe medium and/or high level MET amplification categories, may trigger transfer of \nadditional enrollment slots from these MET gene amplification categories to the Enriched \nOther cohort.  As per the PACL dated 15 May 2017, further enrollment of NSCLC patients \ninto the MET intermediate amplification group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment \nslots were transferred to the Enriched Other cohort to facilitate further enrollment of patients \nwith MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC. As per the PACL dated 11 September 2018, further \nenrollment of NSCLC patients into the MET high amplification group was closed and the \nremaining 14 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations subgroup\nwithin the Enriched Other cohort.\n9.1.3.3. ROS1 Marker Positive NSCLC Cohort\nTo further evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with NSCLC positive \nfor a chromosomal translocation in the ROS1 gene, approximately 30 patients will be \nenrolled.  An ORR of 10% was considered to be uninteresting for further study for this cohort \nwith 30% considered interesting for further exploration.  With 27 evaluable patients, there is \nat least 85% power to test the null hypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 0.10 vs. \nthe alternative hypothesis that it is greater than 0.10 assuming an alternative target rate of \n0.30 with a one-sided alpha=0.05 using a single stage design.  The null hypothesis will be \nrejected if greater than or equal to 6 objective responses are observed among the \n27 evaluable patients.  A total of approximately 30 patients will be enrolled into this cohort \nto adjust for 10% loss of patients who are not evaluable for response.\nAs of a database snapshot date of 19 April 2012, 8 confirmed objective responses (CR, \npartial response [PR]) were observed in a total of 14 response evaluable patients enrolled in\nthe ROS1 marker-positive NSCLC cohort. Based on the number of confirmed objective \nresponses observed (CR, PR), the null hypothesis was rejected. As recorded in the Note to \nFile dated 12 November 2012, and in Protocol Amendment 20, the sample size of the ROS1\nmarker-positive NSCLC cohort was increased to a total of 50 patients in order to provide a \nmore robust estimation of antitumor activity in this patient population.\nFurther details for the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort are provided in Appendix 10.\n9.1.3.4. Enriched Other Cohort\nTo evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with other tumor types that \nhave a molecular marker that confers sensitivity to PF-02341066 (eg, other tumor types \nbesides NSCLC), the sample size of the Enriched Other cohort will be dependent upon the \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 108\nnumber of enrolled patients meeting the criteria for this cohort; however it is anticipated that \napproximately 171 patients will be enrolled.\nFurther details for the Enriched Other cohort are provided in Appendix 11.\nIn the Enriched Other cohort, approximately 50 NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET\nExon 14 alterations will be enrolled.  In addition, a separate group of approximately \n5 NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations will be enrolled in \nclinical sites in Japan. With Sponsor written approval and IRB/EC notification, additional \npatients may be enrolled as described earlier in this section (Section 9.1) to reach this target \nenrollment in the event that overall enrollment is achieved prior to reaching this target.  \nIn NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations, an ORR of 10% will be\nconsidered uninteresting for further study for this group, with 30% considered interesting for \nfurther exploration.  With 33 evaluable patients, there is at least 90% power to test the null \nhypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 0.10 versus the alternative hypothesis that it \nis greater than 0.10 assuming an alternative target rate of 0.30 with a one-sided \u03b1=0.05 based \non a single stage design using exact test.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if \uf0b37 objective \nresponses are observed among the first 33 evaluable patients.  As of data cutoff date 01 \nAugust 2016, 11 confirmed objective responses (CR, PR) were observed in a total of 28 \nresponse-evaluable patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  Based on the number of \nconfirmed objective responses observed, the null hypothesis was rejected. The proportion of \nresponders will be estimated with better precision if the number of evaluable patients exceeds \n33 patients.\n1. As of Amendment 23 (21 February 2017), the sample size in the Enriched Other \ncohort was further increased to a total of 130 patients, including approximately \n50 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  In addition, a separate group of \napproximately 5 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was planned to be \nenrolled in clinical sites in Japan.  \n2. As of the PACL issued 15 May 2017 further enrollment of NSCLC patients into the \nMET intermediate amplification group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment \nslots were transferred to the Enriched Other cohort to facilitate further enrollment of \npatients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a result, the total enrollment for \npatients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was increased to 68 patients (50 original \npatients + 13 transferred slots + 5 Japanese patients). \n3. As of the PACL issued 07 December 2017, sites were allowed to enroll additional 13 \npatients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC into the Enriched Other cohort, which \nwere originally slotted for the broader Enriched Other cohort and were now assigned \nspecifically to patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a result, the total \nenrollment of the Enriched Other cohort subset of patients with MET \nExon 14-positive NSCLC increased to 81 patients (68 + 13 patients).  \n4. As of the PACL issued 11 September 2018, further enrollment of NSCLC patients \ninto the MET high amplification group was closed and the remaining 14 enrollment \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 109\nslots were transferred to the MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC subgroup within the \nEnriched Other cohort. As a result, the total enrollment for patients with MET Exon \n14-positive NSCLC was increased to 103 patients (81+14+8 additional slots were \npermitted without exceeding the total overall study enrollment of approximately 600 \npatients).\n5. As of the Investigator Communication Letter dated January 7, 2019, further \nenrollment of NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations was \nclosed.\n9.1.4. RP2D Rifampin Interaction Sub-study\nAt least 8 evaluable patients, who complete full PK sampling for PF-02341066 on Cycle 1 \nDay 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1, will be required for the rifampin interaction study in the RP2D \ncohort.  A total of approximately 25 patients will be enrolled into this cohort to obtain the \n8 evaluable patients (eg, adjust for loss of patients due to early discontinuations, etc). Eight \nevaluable patients will provide 90% confidence intervals for the difference between\ntreatments of \uf0b10. 276 on the natural log scale for steady state AUC (AUCss), with \n80% coverage probability.  An approximately 36% decrease in PF-02341066 AUCss is \nanticipated when co-administered with rifampin.11  (See Table 7).\nTable 7.\nExpected Precision for Effect of Rifampin on PF-02341066 (90% CI,\n80% Coverage Probability, 25% CV)\nSample Size\nEstimated Ratio\nProbable CI, Lower Limit\nProbable CI, Upper Limit\nProbable CI Width\n8\n0.3\n0.228\n0.395\n0.167\n0.5\n0.379\n0.659\n0.280\n0.8\n0.607\n1.054\n0.447\n1.0\n0.759\n1.318\n0.559\nTable 7 presents the width of 90% confidence intervals for the AUC ratio for different \nestimated effects assuming a within-patient coefficient of variation (CV) of 25%.

RP2D Itraconazole Interaction Sub-study\nAt least 8 evaluable patients, who complete full PK sampling for PF-02341066 on Cycle 1 \nDay 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1, will be required for the itraconazole interaction study in the \nRP2D cohort.  As of Protocol Amendment #22, the Single and Multiple-Dose PK Design will \nno longer be required.  Approximately 25 patients will be enrolled to obtain at least\n8 evaluable patients for multiple-dose PK (eg, adjust for loss of patients due to early \ndiscontinuations, etc). Eight evaluable patients will provide 90% confidence intervals for the \ndifference between treatments of \uf0b10.276 on the natural log scale for AUCss, with \n80% coverage probability.  An approximately 2-fold increase in PF-02341066 AUCss is \nanticipated when co-administered with itraconazole.12 (See Table 8).\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 110\nTable 8.\nExpected Precision for Effect of Itraconazole on PF-02341066 (90% CI, 80% \nCoverage Probability, 25% CV\nSample Size\nEstimated Ratio\nProbable CI, Lower Limit\nProbable CI, Upper Limit\nProbable CI Width\n8\n1.0\n0.759\n1.318\n0.559\n2.0\n1.517\n2.635\n1.118\n3.0\n2.277\n3.955\n1.678\nTable 8 presents the width of 90% confidence intervals for the AUC ratio for different \nestimated effects assuming a within-patient coefficient of variation (CV) of 25%.

See the Statistical \nAnalysis Plan for further details regarding complete evaluability criteria.\n9.1.6. Hypogonadism \nThe sample size for laboratory testing will be determined by the number of eligible male \npatients who enroll in the MET-amplified NSCLC and the Enriched Other cohorts.  \nAccordingly, assuming 50% of patients enrolled will be male, projected sample sizes are as \nfollows:\n\uf0b7\nIt is anticipated that up to 25 males (approximately 19 from the MET-amplified \nCohort and approximately 6 from the Enriched Other Cohort) may be available for \nhypogonadism testing.  Testing will be performed at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, \nand Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1, every 3 cycles and End of \nTreatment.  As few as 10 male patients may achieve the Cycle 6 Day 1 testing.\n9.2. Analysis\nUnless otherwise specified, the study population for all safety analyses will include all\npatients enrolled in the study who receive at least one dose of PF-02341066.  The study \npopulation for efficacy analyses depends on the parameter; the analysis of some endpoints\n(eg, ORR, disease control rate [DCR]) will be based on a response evaluable population\nwhile the analysis of other endpoints (eg, progression free survival [PFS] and overall survival \n[OS]) will be based on the safety population.  \nDue to the exploratory nature of this study, no confirmatory inferential analyses are planned, \nand no imputation for missing data will be done.  Descriptive statistics (such as means, \nmedians, standard deviations and ranges for continuous data and percentages for categorical \ndata) will be used to summarize patient characteristics, treatment administration/compliance, \nefficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic parameters.  Data will also be displayed graphically, \nwhere appropriate.  \n9.2.1. Efficacy Analysis \nFor each cohort and tumor type, the best overall response (confirmed CR, confirmed PR, SD \nor PD according to RECIST criteria) for each patient evaluable for response will be listed.  \nOther endpoints including overall response rate, duration of response, time to response, \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 111\nprogression free survival, probabilities of survival at 6 and 12 months and others as \nappropriate, may be summarized to further evaluate anti-tumor activity.  Details regarding \nendpoint definitions and methods of analysis are presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan.\nFor ORR summaries, patients enrolled into a specific cohort (eg, ALK marker negative \nNSCLC cohort) at the time of study entry but subsequently determined through molecular \ntesting to be positive for a marker relevant to another cohort (eg, ROS1 marker positive or \nMET-amplified NSCLC) may be summarized together as a subgroup within their initial \ncohort and also pooled with patients in the other cohort as appropriate. \n9.2.1.1. Analysis of ALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohorts\nThe best response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD] or \nprogressive disease [PD]) per RECIST version 1.1 will be summarized.  ORR calculated as \nthe number of evaluable patients with a best response of confirmed CR or PR divided by the \ntotal number of evaluable patients in the ALK marker negative cohort will be provided, along \nwith the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% confidence interval calculated using a method \nbased on the F distribution. \nFurther details for the ALK marker negative NSCLC Cohort #2 are provided in Appendix 8.\n9.2.1.2.

The ORR, calculated as the number of evaluable patients with a best overall \nresponse of CR or PR divided by the total number of evaluable patients, will be provided \nalong with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% confidence interval calculated using a \nmethod based on the F distribution. \nFurther details for the MET-amplified NSCLC cohort are provided in Appendix 9.\n9.2.1.3. Analysis of ROS1 Marker Positive NSCLC Cohort\nThe null hypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 0.10 vs. the alternative hypothesis \nthat the ORR is greater than 0.10 will be tested as described in Section 9.1.3.3.\nThe best response per RECIST version 1.0 will be summarized.  ORR, calculated as the \nnumber of evaluable patients with a best overall response of CR or PR divided by the total \nnumber of evaluable patients, will be provided along with the corresponding exact 2-sided \n95% confidence interval calculated using a method based on the F distribution. \nFurther details for the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort are provided in Appendix 10.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 112\n9.2.1.4. Analysis of Enriched Other Cohort\nAll data for the Enriched Other cohort will be listed, including the best overall response per \nRECIST version 1.0.  However, summaries of ORR will be presented by tumor \ntype/molecular marker, as appropriate depending on the number of patients who have the \nsame tumor type and molecular marker.\nSpecifically, all safety and antitumor activity data of NSCLC patients with tumors harboring \nMET Exon 14 alterations will be summarized separately from the Enriched Other Cohort. \nData from patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations who are enrolled outside \nof Japan will be summarized separately and may be combined, for specific reporting, as \ndescribed in the Statistical Analysis Plan, with the data from patients enrolled in clinical \nsites in Japan.\nORR, calculated as the number of evaluable patients with a best overall response of CR or \nPR divided by the total number of evaluable patients, will be provided along with the \ncorresponding exact 2-sided 95% confidence interval calculated using a method based on the \nF distribution. \nFurther details for the Enriched Other cohort- are provided in Appendix 11.\n9.2.1.5. Hypogonadism Testing\nThe statistical analysis of hypogonadism parameters (total and free testosterone levels, \nSHBG, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, \nestradiol and prolactin) will be exploratory. The laboratory parameter of primary interest is \nfree testosterone, with secondary interest in total testosterone, SHBG, luteinizing hormone \nand follicle stimulating hormone.  Details regarding hypogonadism parameters, endpoint \ndefinitions and methods of analysis are decribed in the Statistical Analysis Plan..\n9.2.2. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics\n9.2.2.1. Single- and Multiple-Dose PF-02341066 PK Analysis\nAll patients who complete at least one day of PK blood sampling will be included in the PK \nanalyses.  Standard plasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma \nconcentration (Cmax), minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), time to maximum plasma \nconcentration (Tmax), and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from zero \ntime to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUC0-last) and/or area under the plasma \nconcentration versus time curve from zero time to the dosing interval time \u03c4 (AUC\u03c4) for \nPF-02341066 (including its active moieties, if appropriate) will be estimated using \nnon-compartmental analysis.  If data permit, area under the plasma concentration versus time \ncurve to infinity (AUC0-\uf0a5), terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), oral plasma clearance (CL/F)\nand apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) will be also estimated.

Effect of PF-02341066 on MDZ PK  \nPlasma concentration-time data of MDZ after each dose will be analyzed using \nnon-compartmental methods to estimate the following PK parameters in individual patient:  \nCmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, and, if data permit, AUC0-\uf0a5, T1/2, CL/F and Vd/F.  Descriptive statistics \nwill be provided for these PK parameters in tabular form.\nThe primary pharmacokinetic parameter AUC0-last will be utilized to estimate the effect of \nmultiple doses of PF-02341066 on a single dose of MDZ.  In the RP2D cohort, the parameter \nwill be log transformed and analyzed using a mixed-effect model with treatment as the fixed \neffect and subject as the random effect.  Ninety-percent confidence intervals for the ratio of \ngeometric means of MDZ AUC0-last in presence of PF-02341066 and MDZ alone will be \ncomputed to assess the interaction. \n9.2.2.3. Effect of Food on PF-02341066 PK\nThe effect food will be assessed based on AUC0-last, AUC0-\uf0a5, and Cmax by determining the \nratios (fed/fast) of geometric means of these PK parameters and the 90% confidence \nintervals for the ratios.\n9.2.2.4. Effect of Rifampin on PF-02341066 PK \nFor the rifampin sub-study, plasma concentration-time data of PF-02341066 and its \nmetabolite(s) before and after multiple doses of rifampin will be analyzed using non \ncompartmental methods to estimate individual PK parameters including, but not limited to, \nCmax, Tmax, Ctrough, AUCtau, CL/F (PF-02341066 only), and metabolite-to-parent ratio.  \nDescriptive statistics will be provided for these PK parameters in tabular form.\nThe primary pharmacokinetic parameters AUCtau and Cmax will be utilized to estimate the \neffect of rifampin on multiple-dose PK of PF-02341066.  The parameters will be log \ntransformed and analyzed using a mixed-effect model with treatment as the fixed effect and \npatient as the random effect.  The ratios (Test/Reference) of adjusted geometric means and \n90% confidence intervals for the ratios will be computed for PF-02341066 AUCtau and Cmax\nto assess the interaction.  PF-02341066 alone will be the Reference and PF-02341066 in the \npresence of rifampin will be the Test.\nFor more details on the rifampin interaction study refer to Appendix 6.\n9.2.2.5. Effect of Itraconazole on Single- and Multiple-Dose PF-02341066 PK \nAs of Protocol Amendment #22, blood samples for single-dose PK parameters for \nPF-02341006 and its metabolite(s) will no longer be required.  For the itraconazole \nsub-study, plasma concentration-time data of PF-02341066 and its metabolite(s) following \nsingle (if possible) and multiple doses of PF-02341066 before and after itraconazole \ntreatment will be analyzed using non compartmental methods to estimate individual PK \nparameters including, but not limited to, Cmax, Tmax, Ctrough, AUC0-t, AUCtau, CL/F \n(PF-02341066 only), and metabolite-to-parent ratio.  Descriptive statistics will be provided \nfor these PK parameters in tabular form. \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 114\nPlasma concentration data of itraconazole (if available) will be summarized and descriptive \nstatistics will be provided in tabular form.\nPharmacokinetic parameters AUCtau and Cmax will be utilized to estimate the effect of \nitraconazole on multiple-dose PK of PF-02341066.  The parameters will be log transformed \nand analyzed using a mixed-effect model with treatment as the fixed effect and patient as the \nrandom effect.  The ratios (Test/Reference) of adjusted geometric means and 90% confidence\nintervals for the ratios will be computed for PF-02341066 AUCtau and Cmax to assess the \ninteraction. PF-02341066 alone will be the Reference and PF-02341066 in the presence of \nitraconazole will be the Test.  For exploratory purposes, the effect of itraconazole on the PK \nof PF-06260182 (metabolite of PF-02341066) will be analyzed according to the above \ndescription.\nMultiple-Dose PK Design: Each patient is scheduled to receive treatment for two treatment \nperiods (A followed by B) as described below: \nTreatment Period A (Test): PF-02341066 250 mg QD will be administered from \nCycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 15 and itraconazole 200 mg QD from Cycle 1 Day 1 to \nCycle 1 Day 16 (before Cycle 1 Day 16 PF-02341066 dosing).\nTreatment Period B (Reference): PF-02341066 250 mg QD will be administered from \nCycle 1 Day 16 to Cycle 2 Day 1.\nIf possible, pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t and Cmax will be utilized to estimate the \neffect of itraconazole on the single-dose PK of PF-02341066.  The parameters will be log \ntransformed and analyzed using a mixed-effect model with treatment as the fixed effect and \npatient as the random effect.  The ratios (Test/Reference) of adjusted geometric means and\n90% confidence intervals for the ratios will be computed for PF-02341066 AUC0-t and Cmax\nto assess the interaction.

PK/PD Modeling\nPopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of samples collected in this study will be performed in \naccordance with the FDA guidance on Population Pharmacokinetics (February 1999).18 The \nplasma concentration data set from this study may be pooled with data sets from other \nPF-02341066 clinical studies.  Population pharmacokinetic analysis will involve mixed \neffects modeling performed using appropriate software (eg, NONlinear Mixed-Effect \nModeling (NONMEM)).  The data from the analysis will describe the PK following single \nand multiple dose administration of PF-02341066 and describe covariates that are important \ndeterminants of PF-02341066 disposition including, but not limited to, demographic data, \nconcomitant medications, pharmacogenomics.\nIn addition, population PK/PD modeling will be attempted to investigate any causal \nrelationship between PF-02341066 exposure (including its active moieties, if appropriate) \nand biomarker, safety, anti-tumor activity, and/or laboratory data.\nThese modeling analyses may be reported separately from the final Clinical Study Report.\n9.2.8. Safety Analysis\nFor each dose escalation cohort (BID and QD), DLT\u2019s will be summarized by category \n(hematologic and non-hematologic) and by MedDRA preferred term.\nAdverse Events (AEs) will be coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term \naccording to MedDRA terminology. AE severity will be graded according to NCI Common \nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. \nA listing of all AEs including detailed information collected for each AE (description of \nevent, onset date/time, duration, seriousness, severity, relationship to study drug, action \ntaken, clinical outcome) will be presented. \nThe number and percentage of patients who experienced any: AE, serious AE (SAE), \ntreatment related AE, and treatment related SAE will be summarized.  The denominator used \nto calculate incidence percentages consists of patients receiving at least 1 dose of \nPF-02341066.  AE data will be presented by dosing schedule across cycles and for each \ncycle.  The denominator for each cycle is defined as those patients available at the start of the \ncycle who received at least 1 dose of PF-02341066 for that cycle.  Emphasis in the analyses \nwill be placed on AEs classified as treatment emergent. \nAdditional summaries of adverse events (AE) and of other safety data will be presented in \ntabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, as appropriate.\nAnalysis of Clinical Labs: Listing tables will be prepared for each laboratory measure, and \nwill be structured to permit review of the data by patient as they progress on treatment.  \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 116\nSummary tables, graphic displays and shift tables, as appropriate, will be prepared to \nillustrate the results over time on study.\n9.2.9. [18F]-FLT-PET Analysis\nFor [18F]-FLT-PET, SUV will be calculated for each evaluable lesion at baseline and then \naverage baseline SUV will be determined.  The mean change in the SUV from baseline for \neach lesion within a patient and overall for each patient will be determined and the overall \nmean change will be calculated.  Descriptive statistics in tabular form will be used to \nsummarize the results.\n9.3. Interim Analysis\nNo formal interim analysis will be conducted for this study. However, as this is an \nopen-label study, the Sponsor may conduct unblinded reviews/reporting of the data during \nthe course of the study for the purpose of safety and efficacy assessment, facilitating \ndose-escalation decisions, facilitating pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) \nmodeling, and/or to support clinical development.\n9.4. Data Monitoring Committee \nAn external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will not be established for the study.  The \nPF-02341066 Clinical Team will monitor safety throughout the project through the following \nefforts:\n\uf0b7\nSurveillance for serious adverse experiences (SAEs) according to regulatory \nguidelines.\n\uf0b7\nRoutine monitoring of non-serious adverse experiences as they are recorded in the \ncase report forms or appear in the source documents at the study sites.\n\uf0b7\nPeriodic teleconferences with the principal investigators on individual studies to share \nexperiences and ensure communication.\nFindings having immediate implication for the management of patients on study will be \ncommunicated to all Principal Investigators in the timeframe associated with unexpected and \ndrug-related SAEs.\nSafety surveillance studies will include routine monitoring of clinical laboratory parameters, \nphysical examination, adverse event (AE) reporting, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, \nand cardiac function studies.  Increased monitoring of certain serum biochemistry, blood \ncount, imaging studies/cardiac studies and physical examination will be dependent on animal \ntoxicology findings and consultation with The Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 117\n10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\nPfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during the study conduct to ensure \nthat the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may \nreview source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The \ninvestigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate \nregulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This \nverification may also occur after study completion.\nDuring study conduct and/or after study completion, the trial site may be subject to review by\nthe institutional review board (IRB)/ ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality assurance \naudits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to \ninspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.\nThe investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection \nnotification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer \nor its agents to prepare the study site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, \nwhenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator \nwill promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the \npatient's medical records.  The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection \nfindings to Pfizer or its agent.  Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the \ninvestigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on \nresponses to any such findings.\nIt is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the \nmonitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the \nprocess. \n11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING\n11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record\nAs used in this protocol, the term case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to \neither a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection \nmethod used in this trial.\nA CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed\noriginal CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to \nthird parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory \nauthorities, without written permission from Pfizer.\nThe investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, \nsafety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source \ndocuments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, \nconsistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The \nCRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the \ndata contained on the CRFs is true.  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source \ndocuments must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the \noriginal entry.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 118\nIn most cases, the source documents will be the hospital's or the physician's chart. In cases \nwhere the source documents are the hospital or the physician's chart, the information \ncollected on the CRFs must match those charts. \nIn some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as the source documents.  In \nthese cases, a document should be available at the investigator\u2019s site as well as at Pfizer and \nclearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand \nas the source document.\n11.2. Record Retention\nTo enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator\nagrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient \ninformation to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed \nconsent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and \ndetailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant \ncorrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be \nretained by the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) \nguidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, \nwhichever is longer.\nIf the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the \nrequired period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified.  The trial \nrecords must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, \nanother institution, or to and independent third party arranged by Pfizer.  Investigator records \nmust be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or \nfor longer if required by applicable local regulations. \nThe investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, \neven if retention requirements have been met.\n12. ETHICS\n12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)\nIt is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the trial protocol, \nprotocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, \neg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC.  All correspondence with the \nIRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be \nforwarded to Pfizer.\nThe only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is \nwhere the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In \nthat event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after \nthe implementation.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 119\n12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Trial\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory \nrequirements, and the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for \nBiomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of \nMedical Sciences 2002), ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, (ICH 1996), and the \nDeclaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 2008).\n12.3. Patient Information and Consent\nAll parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names \nor other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where \nrequired by law.\nWhen study data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, patient \nnames, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical code consisting \nof a numbering system provided by Pfizer in order to de-identify the study patients. The \nstudy site will maintain a confidential list of patients who participated in the study linking \neach patient\u2019s numerical code to his or her actual identity.\nIn case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection \nof patients\u2019 personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws.\nThe informed consent documents and any patient recruitment materials must be in \ncompliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including \napplicable privacy laws.\nThe informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and any patient \nrecruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by Pfizer, approved by the IRB/EC \nbefore use, and available for inspection. \nThe investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his or her legally acceptable \nrepresentative is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible \nrisks associated with participation. \nWhenever consent is obtained from a patient\u2019s legally acceptable representative, the patient\u2019s \nassent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the \ncapacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC.  If the investigator determines that \na patient\u2019s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonably be consulted, as \npermitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, then \nthe patient\u2019s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not \nobtained.  If the study patient does not provide his/her own consent, the source documents \nmust record why the patient did not provide consent (eg, decisionally impaired adult), how \nthe investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient\u2019s legally \nacceptable representative, the consent signer\u2019s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent,\nspouse) and that the patient\u2019s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally it \nmust be documented in the source documents.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 120\nThe investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed \nconsent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative before any \nstudy-specific activity is performed.  The investigator will retain the original of each patient's \nsigned consent form.\nNote: For investigational sites using WIRB, patients who lack the capacity to consent for \nthemselves will not be able to enroll into this study.\n12.4. Patient Recruitment\nAdvertisements approved by ethics committees and investigator databases may be used as \nrecruitment procedures. \n12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP\nIn the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable \nCompetent Authority in any area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any new \ninformation which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the \ninvestigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. \nIn addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures \ntaken by the investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of \nany serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.\n13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL\nEnd of Trial in all participating sites is defined as the time at which it is deemed that \nsufficient patients have been recruited and completed the trial as specified in the protocol and \nthe clinical study report (CSR) has been finalized.\n14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA\nPremature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority \ndecision, change in opinion of the IRB/EC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of \nPfizer.  In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-02341066 at \nany time.\nIf a trial is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the \ninvestigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and \nthe hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a time period set by Pfizer.  As directed by \nPfizer, all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent \npossible.\n15.

RECIST version 1.0 Tumor Assessment Criteria17\nAt baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable (defined \nbelow).\nAll baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the first day of study \ntreatment and never more than 4 weeks before starting therapy.\nMeasurable Lesions\n\uf0b7\nLesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to \nbe recorded) as \uf0b32.0 cm with conventional techniques or \uf0b31.0 cm with spiral \nCT scan.\n\uf0b7\nA tumor lesion that is situated in a previously irradiated area is eligible for \nmeasurable disease provided: 1) there has been documented disease progression in \nthis site; 2) the criteria for measurability as outlined above are met; 3) this is not the \nonly site of measurable disease.\n\uf0b7\nAll measurements should be determined using a ruler, calipers or digital technology, \nand recorded on the CRF in metric notation.\nNonmeasurable Lesions\nAll other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <2.0 cm with conventional \ntechniques or <1.0 cm with spiral CT) and truly nonmeasurable lesions.  Truly \nnonmeasurable lesions include bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or \npericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis or pulmonis, abdominal \nmasses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions.\nDocumentation of Target and Nontarget Lesions\nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, \nrepresentative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and measured and \nrecorded at baseline.  Target lesions (measurable) should be selected on the basis of their size \n(lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements \n(either by imaging techniques or clinically. A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target \nlesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be \nused as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as nontarget lesions and should also \nbe recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required, and these lesions should be \nfollowed as present or absent.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 127\nTechniques for Assessing Measurable Disease\nThe same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each \nidentified and reported lesion at screening and during follow-up.  Imaging-based evaluation \nis preferred to evaluation by clinical (physical) examination when both methods have been \nused to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.\nAccepted methods of tumor assessment include:\nClinical examination: clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when \nthey are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin \nlesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the \nlesion is recommended.\nChest x-ray: lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are \nclearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.\nCT and MRI: CT and MRI are the best currently available and most reproducible methods \nof measuring target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI \nshould be performed with contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness.  Spiral CT \nshould be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.\nUltrasound: should not be used to measure tumor lesions for objective response evaluation.  \nIt is however a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable nodes, \nsubcutaneous lesions and non-small cell lung nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm \nthe complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.\nEndoscopy and Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor \nevaluation has not yet been fully or widely validated.  Utilization of such techniques for \nobjective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers.  \n \nTumor markers: tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are \ninitially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered a \ncomplete clinical response.\nCytology and histology: the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion \nthat appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for \nresponse or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease \n(an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.\nResponse Criteria\nThe following RECIST criteria will be the primary method utilized in this study for the \nassessment and reporting of tumor response data.\nCCI\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 128\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions, normalization \nof tumor marker levels, and no appearance of new lesions indicates complete response.  Each \nof these must be documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks.\nPartial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LDs of target lesions \n(taking as reference the baseline sum), without progression of nontarget lesions and no \nappearance of new lesions indicates partial response.  Each of these must be documented on \n2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks.\nStable Disease (SD): Neither CR, PR or PD criteria are met.  Patients who have stable \ndisease (SD) as their only response will be categorized as SD.\nProgressive Disease (PD): \uf0b320% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as \nreferences the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, unequivocal progression \nof existing nontarget lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.  The occurrence of \na pleural effusion or ascites is also considered PD if substantiated by cytologic investigation \nand not previously documented.  Pathologic fracture or collapse of bone is not necessarily \nevidence of disease progression; however, new bone lesions not previously documented are \nconsidered PD.\nIn cases where procedures used to assess tumor size suggest tumor necrosis or intratumor \nbleeding coincident with an increase in size, a PET scan or ultrasound should be considered \nbecause it is important to be sure that increasing lesions are due to increased tumor growth\nand not necrosis or bleeding.\nDetermination of Best Overall Response:\nThe best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until \ndisease progression/recurrence.  For PD, taking as reference the smallest measurements \nrecorded since treatment started.  For CR and PR the best response assignment will depend \non the achievement of both measurement and confirmation (at the minimum of 28 days) \ncriteria.  Stable disease rate will be defined as the percentage of patients with stable disease \nbased on the total number of patients evaluable for response.\nDetermination of best overall response is summarized in Table 9 with more details provided \nin the Supplemental SAP.\nTable 9.\nDetermination of Best Overall Response\nTarget \nLesions\nNontarget \nLesions\nNew \nLesions\nOverall \nResponse\nCRa\nCR\nNo\nCR\nCR\nNon-CR/Non-PD\nNo\nPR\nPRb\nNon-PD\nNo\nPR\nSDc\nNon-PD\nNo\nSD\nPDd\nAny\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nPD\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nAny\nYes\nPD\na\nComplete response.\nb\nPartial response.\nc\nStable disease.\nd\nProgressive disease.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 129\nAppendix 4.

RECIST version 1.1 Tumor Assessment Criteria18\nAt baseline, individual tumor lesions will be categorized by the investigator as either \nmeasurable or not, according to the criteria summarized below:\nMeasurable Lesions\nLesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the \nplane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: \n\uf0b7\n10 mm for lesions other than lymph nodes and assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice \nthickness no greater than 5 mm).\n\uf0b7\n10 mm for lesions assessed clinically by caliper measurement (lesions which cannot \nbe accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable).\n\uf0b7\n20 mm for lesions assessed by chest X-ray.\n\uf0b7\n15 mm in short axis for lymph nodes when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice \nthickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). \nNon-measurable Lesions\nNon-measurable lesions include small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological \nlymph nodes with a \uf0b310 but <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  \nTruly non-measurable lesions include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial \neffusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal \nmasses identified by physical exam and not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.\nNodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be \nrecorded or followed. \nSpecial Considerations Regarding Specific Lesions \nBone lesions:\n\uf0b7\nBone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques \nto measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the \npresence or disappearance of bone lesions.\n\uf0b7\nLytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue \ncomponents, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT \nor MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets \nthe definition of measurability described above.\n\uf0b7\nBlastic bone lesions are non-measurable. \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 131\nCystic lesions:\n\uf0b7\nLesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be \nconsidered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they \nare, by definition, simple cysts.\n\uf0b7\n\u2018Cystic lesions\u2019 thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as \nmeasurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  \nHowever, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for \nselection as target lesions.\nLesions with prior local treatment:\n\uf0b7\nTumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other \nloco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been \ndemonstrated progression in the lesion.\nSolitary lesions:\nIf a measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be \nconfirmed by cytology/histology. \nRecording Tumor Measurements\nAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and up to 5 in total and \nrepresentative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and \nrecorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment.  Target lesions should be \nselected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameters) and their suitability for \naccurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). \nThe longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion.  The sum of the longest \ndiameter of all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum diameter to \nbe used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable \ndimension of the disease during treatment. \nOne exception to the above described approach is related to pathological lymph nodes.  \nPathological lymph nodes are defined as measurable lesions and may be identified as target \nlesions if the criterion of a short axis of \uf0b315 mm by CT scan is met.  Only the short axis of \nthese nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  Nodal size is normally reported as two \ndimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the \naxial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal).  The smaller \nof these measures is the short axis. \nA sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all \ntarget lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The baseline \nsum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor \nregression in the measurable dimension of the disease.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 132\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should \nalso be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be \nfollowed as \u2018present\u2019, \u2018absent\u2019, or in rare cases \u2018unequivocal progression\u2019.  In addition, it is \npossible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on \nthe case record form (eg \u2018multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes\u2019 or \u2018multiple liver \nmetastases\u2019).\nDefinition of Tumor Response \nTarget Lesions\nResponse in target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. \n\uf0b7\nPartial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum \nif that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum \nmust also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  The appearance of one \nor more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression.\n\uf0b7\nStable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient \nincrease to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on \nstudy.\nWhen nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to \n\u2018normal\u2019 size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This \nmeasurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate \nprogression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means \nthat patients with CR may not have a total sum of \u2018zero\u2019 on the CRF.\nNon-Target Lesions\nWhile some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and \ninstead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. \nResponse in non-target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization \nof tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm \nshort axis).\n\uf0b7\nNon-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or \nmaintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 133\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  \n(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).\nCytology, Histology \nThese techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by \nprotocol (for example, residual lesions in germ cell tumors).  When effusions are known to \nbe a potential adverse effect of treatment (eg, taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), \nthe cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens \nduring treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or \nstable disease in order to differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive \ndisease.\nFor patients having effusions or ascites, only cases having cytological proof of malignancy \nshould be recorded on the CRF.  Effusions that have not been evaluated using cytology or \nwere found to be non-malignant should not be recorded on the CRF. \nNew Lesions \nThe appearance of new malignant lesions indicates PD.  New lesion should be unequivocal \n(eg, not attributable to differences in imaging technique, or change in imaging modality or \nfindings not attributable to tumor).  If a new lesion is equivocal, for example due to its small \nsize, continued therapy and follow-up assessment will clarify the etiology of the disease.  If \nrepeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared \nusing the date of the initial scan. \nThe use of FDG-PET is sometimes reasonable to complement a CT scan assessment of a PD \n(particularly for possible \u2018new\u2019 disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can \nbe identified according to the following algorithm: \n\uf0b7\nNegative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up \n\uf0b7\nNo FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow- up: if the positive \nFDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is \nPD.\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, \nadditional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring \nat that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that \nis not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.\nConfirmation of Tumor Response \nConfirmation of response is required for non-randomized trials with primary endpoint of \nresponse, but is not required in randomized studies since the control arm serves as \nappropriate means of interpretation of data.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 134\nDetermination of Overall Response by the RECIST version 1.1\nWhen both target and non-target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded \nseparately.

Best \nresponse in trials in which confirmation of complete or partial response is not required \n(ie, randomized trails) is defined as the best response across all time points (for example, a \npatient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment \nhas a best overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be the best response, it must \nalso meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline.  If the minimum time is not \nmet when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient\u2019s best response depends \non the subsequent assessments.  For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD \nat second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD.  \nThe same patient lost to follow-up after the first SD assessment would be considered \ninevaluable. \nWhen confirmation of CR and PR is required (ie, non-randomized trials with primary \nendpoint of response), the best overall response is defined according to the tumor response \nalong the study.  Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each \nare met at a following time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).  In \nthis circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in Table 11.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 135\nTable 11.\nBest Overall Response When Confirmation of CR and PR Required\nOverall response \nFirst time point \nOverall response \nSubsequent time point\nBEST overall response\nCR \nCR \nCR\nCR \nPR \nSD, PD or PRa\nCR \nSD\nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise, PD\nCR \nPD\nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise, PD\nCR\nNE \nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise NE\nPR \nCR \nPR\nPR \nPR \nPR\nPR \nSD \nSD\nPR \nPD\nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise, PD\nPR \nNE\nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise NE\nNE \nNE\nNE\nCR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive \ndisease, and NE = inevaluable.\na If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease \nmeeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have \nreappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met.  \nHowever, sometimes \u2018CR\u2019 may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still \npresent and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point.  Under these circumstances, the \noriginal CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.\nPatients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment \nwithout objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as \n\u2018symptomatic deterioration\u2019.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression \neven after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an \nobjective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of \nsuch patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target lesions.\nIn some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  \nWhen the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the \nresidual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/\n before assigning a status of \ncomplete response.  FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner \nsimilar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent \nfibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively \ndescribed in the protocol and supported by disease specific medical literature for the \nindication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false \npositive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.\nCCI\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 136\nAppendix 6. Rifampin Drug-Drug Interaction Sub-Study \nPatients will be enrolled into the rifampin interaction sub-study prior to the enrollment of \npatients in the itraconazole interaction sub-study.\nBackground:\nThe aim of this sub-study is to determine the effect of the co-administration of rifampin on the \nmultiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetics profile of PF-02341066.  The starting dose of \nPF-02341066 will be 250 mg BID and approximately 25 patients will be enrolled to obtain \n8 evaluable patients.  See Section 9.1.4 for further details.\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A4/5 are the major enzymes involved in the \nmetabolic clearance of PF-02341066. Co-administration of a single 250 mg PF-02341066 \ndose with rifampin (600 mg QD), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in 81.8% and \n68.5% decreases in PF-02341066 AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when \nPF-02341066 was given alone.13  As PF-02341066 is also a CYP3A inhibitor, the magnitude\nof the effects of CYP3A inducers on steady state PF-02341066 exposures may differ from \nthose seen after single doses. A mathematical modeling approach11 based on preclinical and \nclinical data indicate that rifampin co-administration is likely to result in an approximately \n36% decrease in the PF-02341066 AUC. Based on these findings no safety issues in using a \n250 mg BID PF-02341066 dose in combination with rifampin are anticipated.\nNote: Clinical sites in Korea will not participate in the rifampin interaction sub-study.\nPatient Population:  \nThis clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patients are enrolled.  The \nfollowing eligibility criteria are designed to select patients for whom protocol treatment is \nconsidered appropriate.

Itraconazole Drug-Drug Interaction Sub-Study\nThe aim of this sub-study is to determine the effect of itraconazole on the multiple-dose \nplasma pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 when itraconazole is co-administered.  If \nmultiple-dosing of PF-02341066 in combination with itraconazole is tolerable (as defined in \nthe Study Design Section), a cohort of patients may be also enrolled to determine the effect of \nitraconazole on single and multiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of PF-02341066.  \nAs of Protocol Amendment #22, the Single and Multiple-Dose Design will no longer be \nperformed.  The starting dose of PF-02341066 will be 250 mg QD and approximately\n25 patients will be enrolled to obtain at least 8 evaluable patients for multiple-dose PK.  See \nSection 9.1.5 for more details.  Patients who are enrolled in the study but not treated may be \nreplaced to obtain at least 8 evaluable patients for multiple-dose PK.\nThe magnitude of the effects of CYP3A inhibitors on steady state PF-02341066 exposures \nmay differ from those seen after a single dose of PF-02341066 as PF-02341066 is also a \nCYP3A inhibitor.  An autoinhibition-mediated change in apparent clearance of \nPF-02341066 was observed during chronic PF-02341066 treatment.  There are limited data\nwith single doses of PF-02341066 administered with ketoconazole (200 mg BID), a strong \nCYP3A inhibitor.  Co-administration of a single 150 mg oral dose of PF-02341066 in the \npresence of ketoconazole, resulted in increases in PF-02341066 systemic exposure, with \nPF-02341066 AUCinf and Cmax values that were approximately 3.2 fold and 1.4 fold higher, \nrespectively, than those seen when PF-02341066 was administered alone.14 SIMCYP (a \npopulation based pharmacokinetics modeling simulator) modeling12 based on preclinical and \nclinical data, predict a 2-fold increase in PF-02341066 AUC when PF-02341066, at steady\nstate, is co-administered with ketoconazole. The effect of itraconazole on PF-02341066\nexposure cannot be properly predicted due to the lack of a validated physiologically based \npharmacokinetic model.  Based upon recent FDA guidance15 on the use of ketoconazole, \nketoconazole was replaced with another CYP3A strong inhibitor, itraconazole.  However, it \nis expected that the magnitude of the effect of itraconazole would be no greater than that of \nketoconazole given that itraconazole had a smaller inhibitory effect on the exposure of \nmidazolam, a CYP3A probe, than ketoconazole.16  Therefore, the PF-02341066 exposure at \n250 mg QD when administered with itraconazole is expected to be similar to or lower than \nthe PF-02341066 exposure at the maximum tolerated dose of 250 mg BID when administered \nalone.  For these reasons, the same starting dose of PF-02341066 proposed for the \nketoconazole drug-drug interaction, will be used for the itraconazole drug-drug interaction, \nie, 250 mg QD.  However, should additional data arise impacting this assumption, the \nSponsor will adjust the starting dose of PF-02341066 accordingly. \nNote: Clinical sites in South Korea will not participate in the itraconazole drug-drug\ninteraction sub-study.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 146\nPatient Population: \nThis clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patients are enrolled.

                "Content": "Human cancers comprise a diverse array of diseases that collectively are one of the leading causes of death in developed countries throughout the world (American Cancer Society, 2005).1  The progression of cancers is caused by a complex series of multiple genetic and molecular events including gene mutations, chromosomal translocations, and karyotypic abnormalities (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2000).3  Although the underlying genetic causes of cancer are both diverse and complex, each cancer type has been observed to exhibit common traits and acquired capabilities that facilitate its progression.  These acquired capabilities include dysregulated cell growth, sustained ability to recruit blood vessels (ie, angiogenesis), and ability of tumor cells to spread locally as well as metastasize to secondary organ sites (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2000).3  Therefore, the ability to identify novel therapeutic agents that 1) inhibit molecular targets that are altered during cancer progression or 2) target multiple processes that are common to cancer progression in a variety of tumors is predicted to yield improved therapeutic benefit.PF-02341066Chemical Structure:OClClFNNH2NNNHChemical Name: (R)-3-[1-(2,6-Dichloro-3-fluoro-phenyl)-ethoxy]-5-(1-piperidin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-pyridin-2-ylamineMolecular Formula: C21H22Cl2FN5OPF-02341066 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transitionfactor)/HGFR receptor tyrosine kinase.  The rationale for use of this mechanism to treat cancer is supported by an emerging paradigm in oncology that robust clinical efficacy can be obtained with well-tolerated inhibitors directed toward oncogenic tyrosine kinases that are genetically altered through activating mutations, gene translocations, or gene amplification.  PF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 44\nRecent examples include Gleevec\u00ae in gastrointestinal stromal tumors with mutant c-Kit or \nchronic myelogenous leukemia with BCR-Abl gene translocations, Tarceva\u00ae in non-small \ncell lung cancer with mutant EGFR, Herceptin\u00ae in breast cancers with amplified HER-2/neu, \nand SU11248 targeting the VHL-dependent VEGF pathway in renal cell carcinoma.  An \nextensive body of literature indicates that MET/HGFR is one of the most frequently mutated \nor otherwise abnormally activated RTKs in various human cancers (Christensen et al, 2005).2  \nTumor types in which MET/HGFR was reported to be genetically altered by mutation or \ngene amplification include oncology indications with a strong unmet medical need such as \nrenal, metastatic colorectal, glioma, non-small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers \n(Christensen et al, 2005).2  In addition, PF-02341066 demonstrated potent activity against \nNPM-ALK, an oncogenic fusion protein variant of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase, which \nresults from a chromosomal translocation which is implicated in the pathogenesis of human \nanaplastic large cell lymphoma (Pulford et al, 2004).4  In addition to the rationale for \nPF-02341066 based on the genetic dysregulation of its tyrosine kinase targets, an additional \nrationale is based on its predicted ability to target multiple processes that are common to \ncancer progression in a variety of tumors.  Inappropriate activation of MET/HGFR (including \nwild-type MET) is implicated in dysregulation of multiple tumor oncogenic processes such \nas mitogenesis, survival, angiogenesis, invasive growth, and especially in the metastatic \nprocess (Christensen et al, 2005).2  Furthermore, the expression of MET and HGF, its sole, \nhigh-affinity ligand, were demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis or metastatic \nprogression in a number of major human cancers (Christensen et al, 2005).2  The other \nmolecular target of PF-02341066, NPM-ALK, is implicated in the dysregulation of cell \nproliferation and apoptosis in ALCL lymphoma cells (Pulford et al, 2004).4  Consistent with \nits predicted mechanism of action, PF-02341066 inhibited target-dependent tumor cell \nproliferation or invasion, induced tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited angiogenesis in \nnonclinical tumor models.  Oral administration of PF-02341066 also demonstrated efficacy, \nincluding marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed \nactivated MET/HGFR or NPM-ALK.  The collective rationale for investigation of \nPF-02341066 in clinical studies is built on genetic alteration of its molecular targets, its \npredicted ability to target multiple processes that are common to cancer progression, and \npreclinical efficacy data. \nSafety:\nThe primary PF-02341066 toxicities in nonclinical studies were observed in the \ngastrointestinal tract (rat, dog, monkey), hematopoietic system (rat, dog, monkey), kidneys \n(rat), reproductive organs (rat), and actively growing long bones (rat).  Additional effects \nrelated to PF-02341066 administration involved the cardiovascular system based on safety \npharmacology studies, and genetic toxicity findings.  Other findings of uncertain risk to \nhumans include the decreased cellularity in lymphoid organs, elevated liver enzymes, \npotential for phototoxicity, and effects on the salivary glands.\nGastrointestinal Effects: Clinical signs of diarrhea were observed in rats (500 mg/kg/day), \ndogs (\uf0b36 mg/kg/day), and monkeys (50 mg/kg/day).  Focal edema was observed in the \ngastric submucosa in rats given 500 mg/kg/day for 4 days, as well as focal ulceration, \ninflammation, and glandular hyperplasia in one female.  Gastrointestinal effects were not \nobserved in the 1-month study in rats, where doses were tolerated for the full term of the \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 45\nstudy.  Emesis and diarrhea were dose-limiting toxicities observed during the single-dose \nescalation range-finding study in dogs.  Following single doses of 10, 25, and 40 mg/kg, \nsevere gastrointestinal effects were observed, including bloody emesis and diarrhea, along \nwith mucous membranes in the feces.  Histopathological examination of the intestines \nrevealed blood-filled dilated mucosal and submucosal vessels (congestion) and luminal \ncontents of mucus admixed with low numbers of neutrophils.  In the 1-month study in dogs, \nPF-02341066 at \uf0b36 mg/kg/day induced emesis, the incidence and frequency of which \ndecreased as the study progressed, and occasional diarrhea.  There was no effect on food \nconsumption or body weight, and no histopathological correlate was identified at the end of\nthe study.  Diarrhea and soft feces were also observed in monkeys given 50 mg/kg/day of \nPF-02341066.  A decrease in phosphorus observed in this study may have been related to \ndecreased intestinal absorption.  Marked cecal erosion and ulceration were observed in one \nmonkey euthanized moribund on Day 21. \nKidney Effects: Microscopic evidence of minimal to mild renal cortical tubule vacuolation \nwas observed following 28 days of dosing in male rats treated with \uf0b350 mg/kg/day of \nPF-02341066.  Urinalysis revealed significant decreases in urine pH from 50 mg/kg/day in \nmales and at 150 mg/kg/day in females.  The mechanism for renal tubular vacuolation is not \nknown, however HGF is highly expressed in the kidney tubular epithelium (Birchmeier, \n2003)5 with reported cytoprotective effects on renal tubular epithelium (Liu, 1998).6  \nTestes Effects: Microscopic evidence of minimal testicular pachytene spermatocyte \ndegeneration was observed in rats given \uf0b350 mg/kg/day of PF-02341066 for 28 days.  The \nmechanism responsible for the degenerative effects in the testes is not understood, however \nMET is known to be expressed on human seminiferous epithelium and on immature and \nmature spermatozoa (Depuydt, 1996).7\nHematopoietic Effects: Bone marrow hypocellularity was observed in toxicity studies in rats \nand monkeys with PF-02341066.  Repeated administration of PF-02341066 for 28 days \ncaused bone marrow hypocellularity at doses of 150 mg/kg/day (rats, males only) and \n50 mg/kg/day (monkeys).  Minimal bone marrow hypocellularity was also produced in rats \nof both sexes when PF-02341066 was administered for shorter time duration (2 days at \n2000 mg/kg and 4 days at 500 mg/kg/day).  Bone marrow hypocellularity was not observed \nin dogs, however a decrease in white blood cells was identified following 3 single doses up \nto 40 mg/kg and 7 days of PF-02341066 at 20 mg/kg/day.  In monkeys, cytospin examination \nshowed evidence of increased numbers of macrophages and debris consistent with bone \nmarrow cytotoxicity, and correlated with the bone marrow hypocellularity observed \nhistopathologically.  Hematological analysis revealed decreased reticulocyte counts and\nsuggested suppression of erythroid production within the bone marrow.  In addition, WBC \nprecursors lacked granulation characteristically present in these cells suggesting potential \nperoxidase deficiency in granulocytes.  This change in granulation was also noted in dogs \ngiven 20 mg/kg/day for 28 days.  Vacuolated lymphocytes were identified in male rats given \n150 mg/kg/day, the significance of which is unclear. \nLymphoid Tissue Effects: Lymphoid depletion was observed in the thymus, spleen, lymph \nnodes, or GALT in rats and dogs given PF-02341066.  Findings in rats given 500 mg/kg/day \nfor 4 days were attributed to stress (stress leukogram and clinical signs of intolerance were \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 46\nobserved).  Decreased cellularity was also observed in lymphoid organs in the 1-month study \nin rats at \uf0b350 mg/kg/day, however, these findings were considered of uncertain origin.  \nDecreased thymus weight (\uf0b36 mg/kg/day) correlated to thymic lymphoid depletion in male \ndogs given 20 mg/kg/day PF-02341066 for 28 days, and was also considered to be of \nuncertain relationship to treatment. \nCardiovascular Effects: In vivo cardiovascular effects were observed in the safety \npharmacology study in anesthetized dogs.  PF-02341066 administration was associated with \ndecreases in heart rate and increases in LVEDP at 84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma \nconcentration.  There were also statistically significant differences compared with \nvehicle-treated animals in myocardial contractility (LV+dP/dt) at 164 ng/mL free plasma \nconcentration.  Although there was a statistically significant decrease in myocardial \ncontractility, it should be noted that the actual myocardial contractility values in the treated \nanimals were similar to the pre-dose values.  The main effects of PF-02341066 on ECG \nparameters were statistically significant increases in PR interval, QRS, and QT interval at \n84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma concentration.  The prolongation of PR-interval, QRS and \nQT-interval is probably due to the reduction in heart rate observed at these doses.  \nMonophasic action potential duration during cardiac pacing is a heart rate-independent index \nof cardiac repolarization.  There were statistically significant increases in MAPD100 at sinus \nrhythm at 84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma concentration.  The increases in MAPD100 at sinus \nrhythm were consistent with the decreases observed in heart rate.  The plasma concentrations \nof PF-02341066 achieved in this study were up to 44 times the free efficacious plasma level \npredicted in humans (8.1 nM or 3.7 ng/mL).  In vitro, PF-02341066 blocked potassium \ncurrents or human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel conduction with IC50 and IC20\nvalues of 1.1 \uf06dM (495 ng/mL) and 0.3 \uf06dM (135 ng/mL), respectively.  In the rat aortic \ntension model, in vitro dog isolated Purkinje fibers, and in freshly isolated Guinea pig \nventricular myocytes, PF-02341066 produced effects consistent with calcium channel \nantagonism.  The hERG assay, rat aortic model, Guinea pig myocyte assay, and Purkinje \nfiber data suggest that PF-02341066 is mixed-channel blocker and this may explain the lack \nof effect on MAPD100 during pacing in this study.  The decrease in diastolic blood pressure \nobserved at a free plasma concentration of 164 ng/mL may reflect the calcium channel \nantagonist effects observed in the rat isolated aorta model.  The nonclinical data suggest that \nfree plasma concentrations greater than or equal to 84 ng/mL may produce changes in the \nheart rate and at higher free plasma concentrations (164 ng/mL) changes in diastolic blood \npressure.\nBone Effects: Repeated administration of PF-02341066 for 28 days caused minimal \ndecreased bone formation at the primary spongiosa of growing long bones at a dose of \n150 mg/kg/day in male rats.  Though an off-target relationship cannot be ruled out, reports of \nin vitro data describe possible autocrine regulation of osteoclasts, paracrine regulation of \nosteoblasts (Grano, 1996),8 and modulation of bone resorptive activity of osteoclasts in \nresponse to HGF (Fuller, 1995),9 that may be suggestive of a pharmacological effect on bone.  \nThis toxicity is not expected in the adult patient population, whose growth plates are inactive.\nLiver Effects: An elevation in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate \naminotransferase [AST]) was observed in rats and monkeys given PF-02341066. Rats given \n2000 mg/kg/day for 2 days, 500 mg/kg/day for 4 days, or \uf0b350 mg/kg/day for 28 days showed \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 47\nan elevation in liver enzymes without a microscopic correlate.  Monkeys given 50 mg/kg/day \nof PF-02341066 also had elevated ALT and AST without histological correlate.  The \nelevation of liver enzymes is of uncertain relevance.\nGenotoxic Effects: PF-02341066 was associated with an increased frequency of structural \nchromosomal aberrations in the in vitro cytogenetics assay with and without metabolic \nactivation under the 3-hour test condition.  In addition to the clastogenic response, the \nkinetochore staining results from the in vitro micronucleus evaluation and the observation of \npolyploidy in the cytogenetics assay were consistent with an aneugenic response to\nPF-02341066.  Increased incidences in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (and \nmicronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes) were observed at all doses evaluated in vivo \n(rat) in males only.  The increases in micronuclei were associated with changes in other bone \nmarrow parameters consistent with bone marrow toxicity. \nPhototoxic Effects: PF-02341066 potential for phototoxicity was evaluated due to significant \nabsorbance in the UVA-UVB/visible range from 290 to 700 nm with a molar extinction \ncoefficient of \u22651000 L/Mol/cm, and its photodegradative property.  PF-02341066 was \nevaluated in the 3T3 fibroblast NRU assay with probable phototoxicity results.  Distribution \nof PF-02341066 to tissues with likely sun exposure is not known.  Patients will be advised to \navoid excessive sun exposure while on trial, eg by wearing long sleeve clothing and \nsunglasses and applying sunscreen when outdoors.\nOther Effects: Single-cell necrosis was observed in the ovaries and salivary glands of rats \ngiven 500 mg/kg/day that were euthanized on Day 4 due to moribundity.  Mild depletion of \nsecretory material was also observed in the salivary glands.  Effects in the ovaries and \nsalivary glands were not observed in the subsequent 1-month study.  Increases in WBC \ncounts were observed in the rat and monkey, consistent with an inflammatory response. \nComplete information on PF-02341066 may be found in the Single Reference Safety \nDocument (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator\u2019s Brochure.\nPF-02341066A8081001Final Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 48Figure 2.Summary of 1-Month Repeat-Dose Toxicodynamics for PF-02341066",

                "Content": "MET/HGFR has been well characterized for its role in regulation of cell growth, migration, and invasion of both tumor cells and endothelial cells.  An extensive body of literature indicates that MET/HGFR is one of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) most frequently mutated or otherwise abnormally activated in late-stage human cancer.  When activated, MET/HGFR plays a critical role in regulation of tumor oncogenic processes such as mitogenesis, survival, and invasive growth, and especially in the metastatic process.  Additionally, the emerging role of MET/HGFR in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis indicates potential for dual anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic mechanisms.  Activating mutations in MET/HGFR have been identified in multiple patient populations, including NSCLC (Non Small Cell Lung Cancer), SCLC (Small Cell Lung Cancer), renal cancers, head and neck cancers, and hepatocellular cancer.  In addition to activation driven by mutation, MET/HGFR gene amplification/ overexpression resulting in increased kinase activity has been frequently observed in gastric and colorectal cancer patients.  Furthermore, MET/HGFR is also activated in human tumors by other mechanisms (eg, autocrine loops, paracrine activation from tumor-associated stroma).  Collectively, the dysregulation of MET/HGFR in tumors by multiple mechanisms along with the potential role of MET/HGFR in tumor angiogenesis comprises a large potential patient population.  Most importantly, in preclinical proof of concept studies, both neutralizing monoclonal antibody and RTK inhibitor exhibit convincing antitumor activity in several xenograft models, which supports the concepts that MET is a valid target for treatment of cancer.Mutations in MET Exon 14 were previously reported to be oncogenic drivers in preclinical models of lung cancer (Ma et al, 2003; Ma et al, 2006; Kong-Beltran et al, 2006).22,23,24Given the role of MET/HGFR in regulation of cell growth, migration, and invasion of both tumor cells and endothelial cells, there is increasing interest in understanding the potential effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a treatment in NSCLC patients with tumors PF-02341066A8081001Final Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 49harboring MET Exon 14 alterations. Paik et al (2015) reported on 3 crizotinib-treated patients with NSCLC harboring alterations leading to MET Exon 14 skipping. All 3crizotinib-treated patients were shown to have a partial response.21  In conclusion, MET has been shown to be a valid target, and PF-02341066 is a potent and selective inhibitor of MET.  PF-02341066 exhibits convincing antitumor activity in several xenograft models.  Importantly, it delivers antitumor efficacy in xenograft models with a large safety window, providing increased confidence that mechanism-based toxicity will not be limiting in the clinic.",

                        "Title": "Rationale for Selection of Starting Dose",
                        "Content": "The starting dose for PF-02341066 in the first in human (FIH) trial in cancer patients has been determined to be 50 mg daily, based on information derived from the 1-month repeat dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs (see current IB).The doses tested in the 1-month toxicology rat study were 10, 50, and 150 mg/kg/day orally and the doses in the 1-month dog study were 1, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day orally.  In the rat study, there were no deaths at any dose levels.  The NOAEL identified in the rat study was 10 mg/kg/day.  Only mild to moderate toxicities were observed at the highest dose (150 mg/kg), indicating that the STD10 in rats was greater than 150 mg/kg (900 mg/m2).  There was a significant gender difference suggesting that the male rat was more sensitive than the female, associated with increased plasma exposure of PF-02341066 in male rats.  In the dog study, no serious, irreversible toxicities were observed at any dose level.  Hence, the NOAEL was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day in the dog study.According to DeGeorge et al. (1998),10 the currently accepted algorithm for calculating a starting dose in clinical trials for cytotoxic agents is to use one-tenth of the dose that causes severe toxicity (or death) in 10% of the rodents (STD10) on a mg/m2 basis, provided this starting dose does not cause serious, irreversible toxicity in a non-rodent species.  If irreversible toxicities are produced at the proposed starting dose in non-rodents or if the non-rodent is known to be the more appropriate animal model, then the starting dose would generally be one-sixth of the highest dose tested in the non-rodent that does not cause severe, irreversible toxicity.  Since one-tenth of the highest dose tested in rats (90 mg/m2, equivalent to 4.5 mg/kg in dogs) did not cause any serious, irreversible toxicity in dogs, the starting dose in humans can be estimated as 90 mg/m2, ie, 150 mg daily dose, assuming body surface area of 1.7 m2 for humans.However, the 150 mg starting dose in humans would project a PF-02341066 plasma exposure (steady-state plasma AUC of 3.26 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL) exceeding the NOAEL (AUC of 2.16 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL at 10 mg/kg) in male rats, the most sensitive species.  Furthermore, since the plasma protein binding for PF-02341066 is lower in humans (90.7%) than in rats (94.3%), the unbound AUC (AUCu) in humans (0.303 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL) at the 150 mg starting dose will be higher than that at the NOAEL in rats (0.123 \uf06dg\u00b7hr/mL).  In humans, a dose of 61 mg is expected to yield an unbound drug plasma AUC approximately equal to that observed in rats at the NOAEL.  Since the exposure-based human dose projection provides a lower estimate for the clinical starting dose (61 mg) than that based on 1/10 of the STD10 in rats (150 mg), this dose PF-02341066A8081001Final Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 50rounded to 50 mg (the highest available strength for a single capsule) once daily will be used as the starting dose for the FIH study.",

                        "Content": "PF-02341066 is predominantly metabolized via the CYP3A isozymes in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes.  PF-02341066 also showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A isozymes in human liver microsomes with a kinact of 0.11 min-1 and KI of 3.0 \u03bcM.  Based on these values, the projected PF-02341066 therapeutic dose of 100 mg (Cmax, free19 nM) is predicted to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of co-administered drugs that are CYP3A substrates by approximately 80% due to CYP3A inhibition.  There is a potential for more potent inhibition in patients receiving higher doses, leading to substantial drug interactions with commonly coadministered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.  In addition, PF-02341066 may display nonlinear pharmacokinetics in patients that may require dose adjustments.  To mitigate these risks, a MDZ interaction sub-study has been built into this First in Human (FIH) study to assess the potential PF-02341066 related CYP3A inhibition. MDZ is a benzodiazepine used clinically for conscious sedation.  It undergoes extensive metabolism via CYP3A4/5 and is a widely accepted in-vivo probe for assessing CYP3A activity.  In the current trial, midazolam pharmacokinetics (PK) following a single oral 2-mg dose will be evaluated before and after repeated daily administration of PF-02341066 at 3 dose levels (the next higher dose after the initial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D),in order to assess the effects of PF-02341066 on CYP3A activity in the GI tract and the liver.  The results of MDZ interaction study will be used to assist selection of the RP2D and to determine if there is any need for concomitant medication restrictions or dose modifications in future studies.

For this study, the investigational product is PF-02341066.PF-02341066 will be administered orally once or twice a day in continuous 28-day cycles except 21-day cycles for patients in the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort (see Schedule of Activities and Appendix 8).There will be a lead-in period in which single-dose pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 or MDZ (for patients participating in the MDZ sub-study) will be characterized prior to initiation of continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment.  With the exception of cohorts in which the evaluation of a MDZ interaction is scheduled or patients who are exempted from the Day -7 lead-in dose (see below), all other patients will receive a single dose of PF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 61\nPF-02341066 seven days prior to the start of Cycle 1 (Day \u20137) in order to characterize the \ncomplete PK profile of PF-02341066 after a single dose.  With the approval of \nAmendment #13, only patients enrolled in the QD dose escalation part of the study or Asian \npatients enrolled in any cohort will have the Day -7 lead-in dose.  Patients enrolled in the \nMDZ interaction sub-study will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on Day \u20137.  These \npatients will receive another single 2-mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with PF-02341066 \non Cycle 2 Day 1.  During the study, real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring will be conducted \nas much as possible.\nThe PF-02341066 dose regimen may be changed if the pharmacokinetics and safety data \nsuggest that a discontinuous regimen or another dosing frequency may be preferable.  If a \nBID dosing regimen is incorporated, all study assessments will be based on morning dosing \n(Day -7 dosing will still be a single PF-02341066 dose).  Dosing of oral PF-02341066 will \nbe based on flat milligram increments without adjustment for body size.  The dose will be \n50 mg QD in the initial cohort.\nPatients will be successively assigned to the next available treatment slot within a dose level. \nEach dose cohort will initially include a minimum of 3 evaluable patients for assessment of \ntoxicity within the first cycle.  Dose escalation will occur in 100% increments until either of \nthe following occurrences: (1) drug related toxicity of Grade 2 severity occurs in 2 or more \npatients within a dose level; or (2) mean unbound AUC0-24 exceeds 2.4 \uf06dg\u00b7h/mL (the highest \nunbound AUC tested in the one-month toxicology studies).  Escalation increments will then \nbecome 40%.  In any cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be \nenrolled to that dose level.  If 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience a DLT, no further dose \nescalation will occur (see Figure 4).  Patients will continue treatment at their assigned dose \nlevel for at least 2 cycles to observe for cumulative toxicity.  They may then be treated at the \nnext higher dose level provided it has been shown to be safe in a previously treated cohort.\nIf the highest cohort being evaluated is closed to new enrollment, additional patients who \nhave a cytogenetic abnormality as described in Section 4.1 (Inclusion #1) may enter the \nstudy at the previous dose level.  These patients will not participate in the midazolam \nsub-study and will not have the Day -7 lead-in dose of PF-02341066 or any corresponding \nPK assessments.  They will be evaluated for safety but will not contribute to the MTD \nassessments.  These patients will enter the study on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  Additionally, patients \nscheduled to enroll in the RP2D enriched population cohort (see RP2D Cohorts Section) \nmay be exempted from the Day -7 lead-in dose depending on the their overall medical \ncondition.  This exemption will be granted on a case-by-case basis as agreed upon by the \ninvestigator and Sponsor.  Upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #12, non-Asian patients \nwill also be exempt from the Day -7 lead-in dose.

The Sponsor with the agreement of the \ninvestigators may expand the cohort beyond six patients to better define the safety profile of \nthis cohort in the search for the MTD.  The MTD may be determined for both QD and BID \ndosing.  As of Protocol Amendment #20, the MTD determined from the QD dose escalation \ncohort will not be expanded beyond 6 patients.\nDefinition of DLT\nDLT will have occurred when the patient has one or more of the toxicities noted in the\nTable 1.  To determine dose escalation between cohorts, a DLT must occur within the first \n28 days of treatment (end of Cycle 1).  Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI \nCTCAE Version 3.0 (see Table 1).\nTable 1.\nDose Limiting Toxicities\nToxicity Category\nToxicity/Grade\nHematologic\nProlonged grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days\na Febrile neutropenia, defined here as grade 4 neutropenia with fever \n>38.5\uf0b0C, both sustained over a 24 hour period.\nNeutropenic infection: \uf0b3Grade 3 neutropenia with Grade \uf0b33 infection\nGrade \uf0b33 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or grade 4 lasting \uf0b37 days \nLymphopenia is not considered a DLT unless accompanied by infection.\nOther non-hematologic toxicity\nGrade 3 or 4 toxicities (except for alopecia, Grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia, \ngrade 3 hypertension with controlled blood pressure [<140/90], and \nGrade 3/4 hyperuricemia without signs and symptoms of gout).  Nausea, \nvomiting or diarrhea must persist at grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical \ntherapy.\na\nFebrile neutropenia qualifies as a DLT only if the fever and neutropenia are documented to be coincident \nin time and reconfirmed.\nDoses may not be modified until a DLT has been reached.  The study investigator may \nimplement dose suspension in order to ensure patient safety; this will be considered \ndose-limiting toxicity for the purpose of dose-escalation if PF-02341066 has to be suspended \nfor more than 3 days.  The occurrence of a DLT necessitates immediate interruption of the \nscheduled study treatment in that patient.  Resumption of study treatment for patients \nexperiencing DLTs is permitted, contingent on the return of the DLT to <Grade 1 severity \nand interruption or delay in treatment for no more than 4 weeks.  Resumption of treatment \nafter resolution of a DLT will be at the next lower dose level tested (or 50% lower if the DLT \noccurs with the first dose level).  Patients who discontinue treatment before completing \nCycle 1 (DLT evaluation period) for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity (ie, missed \nappointments, misplaced study drug supplies, development of coexisting medical condition \nrendering the patient unable to swallow medication, development of rapidly progressing \ndisease) will be replaced.\nTo contribute information to the assessment of safety for any dose level, a patient must \nreceive at least 75% of the planned PF-02341066 doses or experience a treatment-related \nAE that prompts early treatment interruption or discontinuation.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 63\nOne or more lower dose level(s) may be tested in search of the MTD, defined as the dose \nlevel immediately below that in which 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience DLTs.  Dose escalation \nmay be stopped if 1) MAD produces PF-02341066 concentrations that are at least 5-fold \ngreater than the projected target concentration, 2) exposure plateaus as the dose is increased \nand 3) MTD cannot be reached within a reasonable dose range (up to 2000 mg).\nMidazolam interaction sub-study\nThe potential for CYP3A inhibition due to PF-02341066 will be evaluated using MDZ as a \nCYP3A4 substrate probe at 3 dose levels of PF-02341066: the next higher dose after the \ninitial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D (see Figure 4).  The MDZ interaction study \nwill be conducted starting in the second dose cohort, and at a higher dose (ie, the predicted \nefficacious dose) in which the trough unbound plasma concentration of PF-02341066 at the \nsteady state will equal or exceed the projected target unbound plasma concentrations \n(12.8 nM).  If the target unbound plasma concentration of PF-02341066 is achieved in the \nsecond cohort, then the MDZ sub-study may not be performed with the higher dose cohort.  \nIn the second cohort or the efficacious dose cohort, at least 3 evaluable patients per cohort \nwill be assessed for the effect of repeat PF-02341066 administration on the \npharmacokinetics of midazolam.  If a significant change in MDZ clearance (>3-fold increase \nin MDZ AUC in all 3 patients, or >5-fold increase in 2 or more patients) is observed at any \nPF-02341066 dose level, further dose escalation may be terminated.\nThe effect of PF-02341066 on CYP3A activity will be evaluated at the RP2D.  Eight \nevaluable patients will be required for the MDZ interaction study in one of the RP2D cohorts \n(see RP2D Cohorts Section).  The results of the MDZ interaction sub-study at the RP2D will \nbe used to determine if there is any need for concomitant medication restrictions or dose \nmodifications in future PF-02341066 studies. \nPatients enrolled in the MDZ interaction sub-study will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of \nMDZ on Day \u20137 and another single 2-mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with PF-02341066 \non Cycle 2 Day 1 (morning dose if the BID regimen is employed).\nRifampin interaction sub-study: Refer to Appendix 6 for further details.\nItraconazole interaction sub-study: Refer to Appendix 7 for further details.\nRP2D cohorts\nThe RP2D will be determined as a dose below or equal to MTD, at which PF-02341066 is \nunlikely to cause an inhibition of CYP3A4 activity.  There will be two RP2D cohorts:\n1. The first RP2D cohort will evaluate drug-drug interactions. This includes the MDZ, \nrifampin and itraconazole interaction sub-studies noted above.  \na.

Enrollment is closed with a \ntotal of 154 patients treated.\nb. Three categories of NSCLC patients with MET amplification defined as: \n1) MET/CEP7 ratio of \uf0b35.0 (Group 1): As per the Protocol Administrative \nClarification Letter (PACL) dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut-\noff for this group was revised to \u22654.0. As per the PACL dated 11 \nSeptember 2018, this group was closed to further enrollment.

The remaining 13 \nenrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations \nsubgroup within the Enriched Other cohort;\n3) MET/CEP7 ratio \uf0b31.8 to \uf0a32.2 (Group 3): As per the PACL dated 12 \nOctober 2015, this group was closed to further enrollment.  \nA total of 68 slots are planned for enrollment. As of IRB/EC approval of \nProtocol Amendment #24, enrollment is closed. Further details for the \nMET-amplified NSCLC cohort is provided in Appendix 9.\nc.\nA group of 50 NSCLC patients positive for chromosomal translocations at \nROS1 gene, including but not limited to CD74-ROS1 and SLC34A2-ROS1\nfusion events, will be enrolled.  Enrollment is closed with 50 patients treated.  \nFurther detail for the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort is provided in \nAppendix 10.\nd. Approximately 171 patients with disease with molecular markers (other than \nALK marker positive NSCLC and ROS1 marker positive NSCLC) that may \nconfer sensitivity to PF-02341066 will be enrolled into the \u2018Enriched Other\u2019\ncohort. This cohort also includes NSCLC patients with tumors harboring \nMET Exon 14 alterations. Sponsor approval is required for enrollment into \nthis cohort.

As of the PACL dated 07 December \n2017, the remaining 13 open enrollment slots in the Enriched Other cohort \nwere assigned specifically to NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET \nExon 14 alterations rather than the broader Enriched Other cohort.  Thus, the \nEnriched Other cohort will be open only for enrollment of NSCLC patients \nwith MET Exon 14 alterations. As of the Investigator Communication Letter \ndated January 7, 2019, further enrollment of NSCLC patients with tumors \nharboring MET exon 14 alterations is closed.\nALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #1: \ne.\nThis cohort will consist of NSCLC patients who are negative for the ALK \ntranslocation as determined by the ALK break apart FISH assay used in \nProtocols A8081007 and A8081005.  A minimum of 25 to a maximum of \n50 evaluable patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed \nat the RP2D, ie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks.  \nEvery effort will be made to ensure that baseline characteristics for these \npatients are comparable to those of ALK marker positive patients enrolled in \nthe A8081007 trial.  In addition to encouraging ALK marker negative patients\nidentified under the A8081007 study to consider enrollment in the Phase 1 \ntrial, baseline characteristics for patients in the A8081007 study will be \nevaluated in a pooled fashion across treatment groups and enrollment of \npatients in the Phase 1 trial may be adjusted to reflect characteristics on \nspecific variables (eg, gender, age, etc).  However, upon agreement between \nthe Sponsor and Investigator, patients who have similar baseline \ncharacteristics to the ALK positive NSCLC patients in this study may be \nallowed to enter this study.  In order to increase comparability of response \nevaluation between ALK marker negative and ALK marker positive patients, \ntumor scans from ALK marker negative patients enrolled in this trial will be \nevaluated by an independent radiology group. As of the Note to File issued \n25 October 2012, tumor scans from patients enrolled into ALK marker \nnegative NSCLC Cohort #1 will no longer be collected for and submitted to \nan independent radiology laboratory for review. Enrollment is closed with \n47 patients treated.\nf.\nALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #2: This cohort will consist of NSCLC \npatients who are negative for the ALK translocation as determined by the ALK \nbreak apart FISH assay by the central laboratory selected by the Sponsor.  At \nleast 20 patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed at the \nRP2D, ie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks.  \nPatients may have been pre-screened using a local ALK test.  However, only \npatients whose pre-screening ALK test was negative and confirmed negative \nby the central laboratory selected by the Sponsor may be enrolled in this trial.  \nNo molecular testing for MET or ROS1 may be performed prior to patient \nenrollment.  As of the Note to File dated 19 June 2012, the requirement that \nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 66\nno molecular testing for MET or ROS1 to occur prior to patient enrollment \nwas removed.  Thus, MET or ROS1 testing may have been performed prior to \npatient entry into this cohort.  However if the test result is either MET or \nROS1 positive, then the patient cannot be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients \nshould, however, have sufficient tumor tissue, ie, 9 slides, if possible, each \ncontaining unstained tissue sections that are 5 microns thick, to be tested for \nROS1 fusion, MET amplification \n \n  The Sponsor will provide tumor shipment \ninstructions for ROS1 and MET testing under separate cover.  Enrollment is \nclosed with 21 patients treated.  Further detail for the ALK marker negative \nNSCLC Cohort #2 is provided in Appendix 8.\nIn addition, if possible, up to 6 patients will undergo pre- and post-dose [18F]-FLT-PET.  \nAlso, if possible, the same patients who have biopsies performed, will undergo \n[18F]-FLT-PET.  A separate sub-study with at least 6 evaluable patients with MET mutation \nor amplification will undergo pre- and post-dose [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET.  With \nthe approval of Amendment #13 by the IRB/EC, no additional patients will undergo PET \nimaging.  Finally, 12 evaluable patients in this cohort will participate in a fed/fast sub-study \n(see below). Clinical sites in Korea will not participate in this sub-study.  Depending upon \nthe overall results from the RP2D cohorts, a different dose/schedule may be tested in \nadditional cohorts.\nFor patients who participate in the fed/fast sub-study, the effect of a high-fat, high-calorie \nbreakfast on PF-02341066 pharmacokinetics will be studied.  Each patient will serve as their \nown control in which PF-02341066 is administered under either \u201cfed\u201d or \u201cfasted\u201d \nconditions on Day -7 and Day 1 of Cycle 1 (morning dose if the BID regimen is employed).  \nPharmacokinetic sampling times are described in Section 7.5.1.1.  The testing order for fed \nversus fasted conditions will be as follows: the first 6 patients to participate in this sub-study \nwill be tested under fed followed by fasted conditions, the next 6 patients will be tested under \nfasted followed by fed conditions.  If patients are receiving PF-02341066 on a BID dosing \nschedule, the evening dose of Day 1 of Cycle 1 will be cancelled.  Patients who have had a \ngastrectomy or have dietary restrictions or adverse events that preclude a 10-hour overnight \nfast or cannot consume the high-fat, high-calorie meal will not be required to participate in\nthis sub-study.  See Section 5.2.3.1 for additional details on the high-fat, high-calorie meal.\nAll tumor scans from ALK marker positive NSCLC patients enrolled in the enriched\npopulation cohort (including ALK marker positive NSCLC patients in the dose escalation \ncohort) will be evaluated by an independent radiology group.  As of the Note to File issued \n25 October 2012, tumor scans from ALK marker positive NSCLC patients will no longer be \ncollected for and submitted to an independent radiology laboratory for review.\nAll tumor scans from ROS1 marker positive NSCLC patients enrolled will be collected and \nsubmitted to an independent radiology laboratory for review until notification is received \nCCI\nCCI\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 67\nfrom the Sponsor.

For all other patients, applicable ophthalmologic \nexaminations should be repeated during the study whenever a vision disorder AE is observed or when there is an increase in CTCAE grade \nfrom the previous visit.  As of the Note To File issued 18 March 2016, the following ophthalmologic tests (added in Protocol Amendment \n#17) are no longer required for NSCLC patients: refractive error, pupil size, intraocular pressure, ocular coherence tomography, dilated \nfundus photography.  See Section 7.3.\nEvery effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule.\nIn the event of significant toxicity, dosing may be interrupted and/or reduced as described \nbelow.  In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst \ntoxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify their investigators at the first \noccurrence of any adverse event.  \nDose modifications may occur in 2 ways:\n\uf0b7\nWithin a cycle: dosing interruption until adequate recovery and dose reduction, if \nrequired, during a given treatment cycle; \n\uf0b7\nIn the next cycle: dose reduction may be required in a subsequent cycle based on \ntoxicity experienced in the previous cycle.\nDose Interruption\nThe study investigator may implement dose suspension and/or reduction in order to ensure \npatient safety; however interruption in treatment should last for no more than 6 weeks.  If a \nlonger interruption is required, discussion with the Sponsor must occur and agreement must \nbe reached between both the Sponsor and Investigator.\nDose Re-Escalation\nDoses reduced for drug-related toxicity should generally not be re-escalated.  However, \nintrapatient re-escalation back one or two dose levels after at least 4 weeks of treatment at the \nreduced dose level may be permitted on a case-by-case basis depending on the clinical setting \nand assessment of risk/benefit ratio after discussion with the Sponsor.\nPF-02341066A8081001Final Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 74Overdose InstructionsIn the event of an overdose, the Sponsor should be contacted to discuss the details of the overdose and formulate a clinical management plan. No information regarding overdose of PF-02341066 in humans is available.  No antidote exists for the treatment of PF-02341066 overdose.  In the event of an accidental overdose, the patient should be monitored for possible signs of toxicity as mentioned above.

See the Investigator\u2019s Brochure for storage conditions of the product.Storage conditions stated in the single reference safety document (Investigator\u2019s Brochure) will be superseded by the storage conditions stated in the labeling.Returned medication for PF-02341066 should be stored separately from medication that needs to be dispensed.  Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study.  Even for continuous monitoring systems, a log or site procedure which ensures active daily evaluation for excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non-working days upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order.  Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor upon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions as described in the labelling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor. Once an excursion is identified, PF-02341066 must be quarantined and not used until the Sponsor provides documentation of permission to use it.  It will not be considered a protocol deviation if the Sponsor approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to Sponsor approval will be considered a protocol deviation.Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site. Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where the product(s) are briefly out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not considered excursions. More specific details will be provided to the sites separately.Site staff will instruct patients on the proper storage requirements for take home medications.If an excursion is identified for itraconazole, the Sponsor should be contacted.PF-02341066A8081001Final Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 79The investigational product manual should be referenced for any additional guidance on storage conditions and actions to be taken when conditions are outside the specified range.The above requirements are to be implemented upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21 if not previously implemented.Capsules: PF-02341066 investigational medication should be stored at 15-25\uf0b0C (room temperature).  Medication should be kept in a secured locked area at the study site in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  Patients should be instructed to keep their medication in its original container and stored at 15-25\uf0b0C (room temperature).

Imaging-based evaluation \nis preferred to evaluation by clinical (physical) examination when both methods have been \nused to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.\nAccepted methods of tumor assessment include:\nClinical examination: clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when \nthey are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin \nlesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the \nlesion is recommended.\nChest x-ray: lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are \nclearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.\nCT and MRI: CT and MRI are the best currently available and most reproducible methods \nof measuring target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI \nshould be performed with contiguous cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness.  Spiral CT \nshould be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.\nUltrasound: should not be used to measure tumor lesions for objective response evaluation.  \nIt is however a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable nodes, \nsubcutaneous lesions and non-small cell lung nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm \nthe complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.\nEndoscopy and Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor \nevaluation has not yet been fully or widely validated.  Utilization of such techniques for \nobjective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers.  \n \nTumor markers: tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are \ninitially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered a \ncomplete clinical response.\nCytology and histology: the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion \nthat appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for \nresponse or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease \n(an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.\nResponse Criteria\nThe following RECIST criteria will be the primary method utilized in this study for the \nassessment and reporting of tumor response data.\nCCI\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 128\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions, normalization \nof tumor marker levels, and no appearance of new lesions indicates complete response.  Each \nof these must be documented on 2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks.\nPartial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LDs of target lesions \n(taking as reference the baseline sum), without progression of nontarget lesions and no \nappearance of new lesions indicates partial response.  Each of these must be documented on \n2 occasions separated by at least 4 weeks.\nStable Disease (SD): Neither CR, PR or PD criteria are met.  Patients who have stable \ndisease (SD) as their only response will be categorized as SD.\nProgressive Disease (PD): \uf0b320% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as \nreferences the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, unequivocal progression \nof existing nontarget lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.  The occurrence of \na pleural effusion or ascites is also considered PD if substantiated by cytologic investigation \nand not previously documented.  Pathologic fracture or collapse of bone is not necessarily \nevidence of disease progression; however, new bone lesions not previously documented are \nconsidered PD.\nIn cases where procedures used to assess tumor size suggest tumor necrosis or intratumor \nbleeding coincident with an increase in size, a PET scan or ultrasound should be considered \nbecause it is important to be sure that increasing lesions are due to increased tumor growth\nand not necrosis or bleeding.\nDetermination of Best Overall Response:\nThe best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until \ndisease progression/recurrence.  For PD, taking as reference the smallest measurements \nrecorded since treatment started.  For CR and PR the best response assignment will depend \non the achievement of both measurement and confirmation (at the minimum of 28 days) \ncriteria.  Stable disease rate will be defined as the percentage of patients with stable disease \nbased on the total number of patients evaluable for response.\nDetermination of best overall response is summarized in Table 9 with more details provided \nin the Supplemental SAP.\nTable 9.\nDetermination of Best Overall Response\nTarget \nLesions\nNontarget \nLesions\nNew \nLesions\nOverall \nResponse\nCRa\nCR\nNo\nCR\nCR\nNon-CR/Non-PD\nNo\nPR\nPRb\nNon-PD\nNo\nPR\nSDc\nNon-PD\nNo\nSD\nPDd\nAny\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nPD\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nAny\nYes\nPD\na\nComplete response.\nb\nPartial response.\nc\nStable disease.\nd\nProgressive disease.\n",

Target lesions should be \nselected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameters) and their suitability for \naccurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). \nThe longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion.  The sum of the longest \ndiameter of all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum diameter to \nbe used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable \ndimension of the disease during treatment. \nOne exception to the above described approach is related to pathological lymph nodes.  \nPathological lymph nodes are defined as measurable lesions and may be identified as target \nlesions if the criterion of a short axis of \uf0b315 mm by CT scan is met.  Only the short axis of \nthese nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  Nodal size is normally reported as two \ndimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the \naxial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal).  The smaller \nof these measures is the short axis. \nA sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all \ntarget lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The baseline \nsum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor \nregression in the measurable dimension of the disease.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 132\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should \nalso be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be \nfollowed as \u2018present\u2019, \u2018absent\u2019, or in rare cases \u2018unequivocal progression\u2019.  In addition, it is \npossible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on \nthe case record form (eg \u2018multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes\u2019 or \u2018multiple liver \nmetastases\u2019).\nDefinition of Tumor Response \nTarget Lesions\nResponse in target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. \n\uf0b7\nPartial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target \nlesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum \nif that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum \nmust also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  The appearance of one \nor more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression.\n\uf0b7\nStable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient \nincrease to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on \nstudy.\nWhen nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to \n\u2018normal\u2019 size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This \nmeasurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate \nprogression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means \nthat patients with CR may not have a total sum of \u2018zero\u2019 on the CRF.\nNon-Target Lesions\nWhile some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and \ninstead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. \nResponse in non-target lesions is defined as follows:\n\uf0b7\nComplete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization \nof tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm \nshort axis).\n\uf0b7\nNon-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or \nmaintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 133\n\uf0b7\nProgressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  \n(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).\nCytology, Histology \nThese techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by \nprotocol (for example, residual lesions in germ cell tumors).  When effusions are known to \nbe a potential adverse effect of treatment (eg, taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), \nthe cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens \nduring treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or \nstable disease in order to differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive \ndisease.\nFor patients having effusions or ascites, only cases having cytological proof of malignancy \nshould be recorded on the CRF.  Effusions that have not been evaluated using cytology or \nwere found to be non-malignant should not be recorded on the CRF. \nNew Lesions \nThe appearance of new malignant lesions indicates PD.  New lesion should be unequivocal \n(eg, not attributable to differences in imaging technique, or change in imaging modality or \nfindings not attributable to tumor).  If a new lesion is equivocal, for example due to its small \nsize, continued therapy and follow-up assessment will clarify the etiology of the disease.  If \nrepeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared \nusing the date of the initial scan. \nThe use of FDG-PET is sometimes reasonable to complement a CT scan assessment of a PD \n(particularly for possible \u2018new\u2019 disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can \nbe identified according to the following algorithm: \n\uf0b7\nNegative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up \n\uf0b7\nNo FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow- up: if the positive \nFDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is \nPD.\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, \nadditional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring \nat that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).\nIf the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that \nis not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.\nConfirmation of Tumor Response \nConfirmation of response is required for non-randomized trials with primary endpoint of \nresponse, but is not required in randomized studies since the control arm serves as \nappropriate means of interpretation of data.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 134\nDetermination of Overall Response by the RECIST version 1.1\nWhen both target and non-target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded \nseparately.  The overall assessment of response will involve all parameters as depicted in\nTable 10.\nTable 10.\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\nTarget lesions\nNon-target lesions\nNew\nLesions\nOverall\nresponse\nCR\nCR\nNo\nCR\nCR\nNon-CR/non-PD\nNo\nPR\nCR\nNot evaluated\nNo\nPR\nPR\nNon-PD or\nnot all evaluated\nNo\nPR\nSD\nNon-PD or\nnot all evaluated\nNo\nSD\nNot all\nevaluated\nNon-PD\nNo\nNE\nPD\nAny\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nPD\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nAny\nYes\nPD\nCR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease,\nPD = progressive disease, and NE = inevaluable.\nBest overall response\nThe best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known.  Best \nresponse in trials in which confirmation of complete or partial response is not required \n(ie, randomized trails) is defined as the best response across all time points (for example, a \npatient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment \nhas a best overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be the best response, it must \nalso meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline.  If the minimum time is not \nmet when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient\u2019s best response depends \non the subsequent assessments.  For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD \nat second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD.  \nThe same patient lost to follow-up after the first SD assessment would be considered \ninevaluable. \nWhen confirmation of CR and PR is required (ie, non-randomized trials with primary \nendpoint of response), the best overall response is defined according to the tumor response \nalong the study.  Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each \nare met at a following time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).  In \nthis circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in Table 11.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 135\nTable 11.\nBest Overall Response When Confirmation of CR and PR Required\nOverall response \nFirst time point \nOverall response \nSubsequent time point\nBEST overall response\nCR \nCR \nCR\nCR \nPR \nSD, PD or PRa\nCR \nSD\nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise, PD\nCR \nPD\nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise, PD\nCR\nNE \nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise NE\nPR \nCR \nPR\nPR \nPR \nPR\nPR \nSD \nSD\nPR \nPD\nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise, PD\nPR \nNE\nSD provided minimum criteria for SD \nduration met, otherwise NE\nNE \nNE\nNE\nCR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive \ndisease, and NE = inevaluable.\na If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease \nmeeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have \nreappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met.  \nHowever, sometimes \u2018CR\u2019 may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still \npresent and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point.  Under these circumstances, the \noriginal CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.\nPatients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment \nwithout objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as \n\u2018symptomatic deterioration\u2019.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression \neven after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an \nobjective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of \nsuch patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target lesions.\nIn some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  \nWhen the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the \nresidual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/\n before assigning a status of \ncomplete response.  FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner \nsimilar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent \nfibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively \ndescribed in the protocol and supported by disease specific medical literature for the \nindication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false \npositive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.\nCCI\n",

As of Protocol Amendment #17, all patients will undergo additional special ophthalmological testing as described in Section 7.3 until written notification by the Sponsor.  As \nof the Note To File issued 18 March 2016, the following ophthalmologic tests (added in Protocol Amendment #17) are no longer required for NSCLC patients: refractive \nerror, pupil size, intraocular pressure, ocular coherence tomography, dilated fundus photography.  All ophthalmology examinations should be performed by an \nophthalmologist.  Ophthalmology examination(s) should be repeated if visual disturbances are observed or if there is an increase in grade for a visual side effect.  The time \npoints of this special testing is designated by \u201c[ ]\u201d in the Schedule of Activities Table and includes Screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, 1 year, yearly thereafter, and \nthen at 2 - 8 weeks after discontinuation of PF-02341066.  For NSCLC patients on a 3-week cycle, 1 year would be Cycle 18 Day 1 and every 17 cycles thereafter.  There is a \n\u00b12 week window for the yearly ophthalmology examination.\n22. Contraceptive Check: As of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21, male patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing potential will \nneed to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of 2 of the selected methods of contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the \nneed to use 2 highly effective contraception methods consistently and correctly and document such conversation and, upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment #23, the patient\u2019s \naffirmation in the patient\u2019s chart.  In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately if one or both selected contraception \nmethods are discontinued, or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the patient\u2019s partner.

Adverse Events: Patients must be followed for adverse events from the first day of study treatment until at least 28 days after the last on-study treatment administration, or \nuntil all serious or study drug-related toxicities have resolved or are determined to be \u201cchronic\u201d or \u201cstable,\u201d whichever is later.  Serious adverse events should be monitored \nand reported as described in the protocol. \n12. Tumor Imaging: CT or MRI scan to be performed to assess disease status at screening, every 8 weeks (based on calendar schedule) starting after the first dose, whenever\ndisease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), to confirm a partial or complete response (at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response), and at the \nend/withdrawal from study treatment.  All tumor scans from NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET gene amplification will be collected and held at the investigative \nsite.  With Sponsor written approval and IRB/EC notification, the Sponsor may request tumor scans to be submitted to an independent radiology laboratory for review at a \nlater date. As per PACL dated 9 March 2018, all tumor scans for patients enrolled in the MET-amplified NSCLCcohort were to be collected and submitted to an independent \nradiology laboratory for review. As of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #24, tumor scans from all patients with MET-amplified NSCLC will no longer be collected for and \nsubmitted to an independent radiology review laboratory. If renal cysts are observed, monitoring with appropriate imaging should be performed at the time of renal cyst \ndiagnosis and thereafter following the same schedule as for tumor imaging.\n13. Survival: All patients should be followed for survival at least every 3 months after discontinuing study treatment until at least one year after the patient\u2019s final dose. As of \nIRB/EC approval of Amendment #22, all patients enrolled into this cohort should be followed for survival every 3 months after discontinuing study treatment until one year \nafter the last patient in this cohort has discontinued PF-02341006 treatment, unless otherwise notified by the Sponsor. As of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #23, all patients \nenrolled into this cohort should be followed for survival every 3 months after discontinuing study treatment until two years after the last patient in this cohort has discontinued \nPF-02341066 treatment, unless otherwise notified by the Sponsor.\n14. Concomitant Medications: Concomitant medications will be recorded from 14 days prior to the start of study treatment, at study entry, and during the study.  Once the patient \nhas withdrawn from study treatment, concomitant medications and treatments should be recorded for 28 days or until all study drug-related toxicities have resolved, \nwhichever is later.\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 180\n15. Pregnancy Test (Serum or Urine): Women of reproductive potential must be tested within 14 days of the first treatment.  This test should be repeated whenever one menstrual \ncycle is missed during treatment or a potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request of IRB/EC or if required by local \nregulations.  As of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21, for female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL \nwill be performed on 2 occasions prior to starting study therapy; once at Screening and once at Cycle 1 Day 1 before PF-02341066 administration. Pregnancy tests will also \nbe routinely repeated at every treatment cycle, at the end of treatment, and additionally whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise \nsuspected.  In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the patient will be withdrawn from study medication.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if \nrequested by IRBs/ECs or if required by local regulations.  See Section 7.2 for further detail.\n16. PK samples will be collected on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2, 3 and 5 at pre-dose (0 hour) and 2-6 hours post-dose.  See Section 7.5.1.1. As of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21, a \nPK sample should be taken around the time that disease progression is confirmed as long as the patient is on PF-02341066.\n17. Blood sample for pharmacogenomics: A single whole blood biospecimen (4 mL) will be collected at baseline (within 2 weeks prior to the first dose) for possible analysis of \nDNA sequence variation in genes that may affect PK of the study drugs, may be associated with specific adverse events or toxicities, or may correlate with efficacy.\n20. Plasma sample for circulating nucleic acid profiling: As of IRC/EC approval of Amendment #21, blood biospecimen (10 mL) for nucleic acid analysis (eg, circulating free \nDNA [cfDNA] or RNA [cfRNA]) will be collected.  As of the Protocol Administrative Clarification Letter dated 12 October 2015, plasma sample for circulating nucleic acid \nprofiling will no longer be required for patients enrolled in the MET amplified NSCLC cohort.\n21. Hypogonadism Laboratory Tests (male patients only): All male patients enrolled into the MET-amplified NSCLC Cohort after IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21 will have \nhypogonadism laboratory tests.  Required blood tests include: total testosterone, free testosterone, SHBG, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, \ndihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol and prolactin.  Blood draws MUST be taken before PF-02341066 dosing and between 07:00 and 10:00 a.m. and, for each individual \npatient, the time of the draw should be as consistent across visits as feasible.  If either total testosterone or free testosterone  decrease to a value that is .both 25% lower than \nbaseline and below the lower limit of normal, then a repeat laboratory test of both these parameters must be performed at the next clinic visit to confirm hypogonadism.  See\nSection 7.2 for further details.\n22. PF-02341066 will be administered at a dose of 250 mg BID.\n23. As of Protocol Amendment #17, all patients will undergo additional special ophthalmological testing as described in Section 7.3 until written notification by the Sponsor.  As \nof the Note To File issued 18 March 2016, the following ophthalmologic tests (added in Protocol Amendment #17) are no longer required for NSCLC patients: refractive \nerror, pupil size, intraocular pressure, ocular coherence tomography, dilated fundus photography.  All ophthalmology examinations should be performed by an \nophthalmologist.  Ophthalmology examination(s) should be repeated if visual disturbances are observed or if there is an increase in grade for a visual side effect.  The time \npoints of this special testing is designated by \u201c[ ]\u201d in the Schedule of Activities Table and includes Screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, 1 year, yearly thereafter, and \nthen at 2 - 8 weeks after discontinuation of PF-02341066.  For NSCLC patients on a 4-week cycle, 1 year would be Cycle 14 Day 1 and every 13 cycles thereafter.  There is a \n\u00b12 week window for the yearly ophthalmology examination.\nCCI\nPF-02341066\nA8081001\nFinal Protocol Amendment 25, 11 May 2021\nPFIZER CONFIDENTIAL\nPage 181\n24. Contraceptive Check: As of IRB/EC approval of Amendment #21, male patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing potential will \nneed to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of 2 of the selected methods of contraception.
