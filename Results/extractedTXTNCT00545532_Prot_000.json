Hoffmann-La Roche LTD  \nCLINICAL \nPHASE  \nIIIb \nINDICATION \nTreatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients \nOBJECTIVES  \nPrimary: \nTo evaluate prospectively the efficacy of oseltamivir for the \ntreatment of influenza in transplant recipients as measured by the \ntime to resolution of influenza symptoms \n \nSecondary: \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and high dose oseltamivir \nin transplant recipients on: \n\u2022 \nThe clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary \nillnesses as evidenced by otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, \nor sinusitis)  \n\u2022 \nThe virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and \nviral loads at different time points) \n\u2022 \nPatient safety and tolerability  \n\u2022 \nThe development of  resistant influenza virus \n\u2022 \nTo characterize the population pharmacokinetics of \noseltamivir (e.g. clearance, volume of distribution) in \ntransplant recipients  \nTRIAL DESIGN \nThis is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center trial of twice \ndaily, conventional and high dose oseltamivir for the treatment of \ninfluenza in immunocompromised patients (as represented by \ntransplant recipients).  Subjects will be stratified by age, transplant \ntype, time since onset of flu symptoms and treatment start (\u2264 24 or \n>24 hours) and vaccination status \nNUMBER OF SUBJECTS \nApproximately 250 (125 per arm) \nNUMBER OF CENTERS \nApproximately 140 centers in the Northern hemisphere \nTARGET POPULATION \nTransplant recipients (liver, kidney, liver and kidney, allogenic \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplant), 1 year of age and older \nenrolled during the influenza season.  The subjects will be positive \nfor influenza by a rapid diagnostic test at baseline. \nLENGTH OF STUDY  \n10 days of treatment, 30 days of follow up.   \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL \nPRODUCT(S) \nDOSE/ ROUTE/ REGIMEN \nOseltamivir/placebo dry powder (to be reconstituted to a \nconcentration of 12 mg/ml) and 75 mg capsules.  The duration of \ndosing in both adults and children is 10 days. \n \nConventional dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup \n\u2264 15 kg   \n \n30 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg  \n \n45 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg  \n \n75 mg twice daily  \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265  13 years): Oseltamivir capsules  \n75 mg twice daily \n \nSubjects randomized to the conventional dose will simultaneously \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 2 \n \n \n \nreceive matching placebo so as to blind them and the investigator \nfrom the high dose arm.  \n \nHigh dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup  \n\u2264 15 kg   \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg  \n \n90 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg \n \n120 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg  \n \n150 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years):  Oseltamivir capsules  \n150 mg twice daily  \n \nDose adjustments:  In both treatment arms, dosing frequency will \nbe decreased to once daily in patients with severe renal impairment \n(Cr Cl in adults between 10-30 ml/min and children between 10-30 \nml/min/1.73M2.). \nCOMPARATOR \u201cDRUG\u201d (or STANDARD OF \nCARE) DOSE/ ROUTE/ REGIMEN \nPlacebo (from pivotal registration trials in otherwise healthy adults) \nASSESSMENTS OF: \n \n- \nEFFICACY \nTime to resolution of all influenza symptoms as recorded in the \ndiary cards. \n- \nSAFETY \nAdverse events, physical exams, vital signs and clinical laboratory \nevaluations \n- \nPHARMACOKINETICS/\n \nPHARMACODYNAMICS  \nPharmacokinetic assessments will be collected as below: \n \nDay 1 (2 \u2018early\u2019 samples: 1 \u2013 4 hours post dose but at least 1 hour \napart) \nDay 6 (2 \u2018late\u2019 samples: 4 - 12 hrs post dose, but at least 1 hour \napart) \nDay 11 (2 \u2018early\u2019 samples on Day 11) \n \nPharmacodynamic assessments will be based on nose and throat \nswabs collected on the days specified in the schedule of \nassessments.   \n \n \nPROCEDURES (summary): \nThe key procedures are: \nBlood draws for serum chemistry, hematology, PK and serology. \nNasal and throat swabs for viral culture and RT-PCR. \n \nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES: \nSample size calculations were performed using a two-sided t-test and are based on the comparison with a \nplacebo control response in the pivotal registration trials in healthy adults of 112 hours for median time to \nalleviation of all symptoms. Assuming an expected median time to alleviation of symptoms of 78 hours for \neach of the two active treatment groups in this study, and a common standard deviation of 98 hours, then \n111 evaluable subjects per group would give more than 90% power to detect a difference between the \ncontrol and each of the active treatment groups. \n \nThe primary endpoint will be time to alleviation of all clinical influenza symptoms, as recorded in the diary \ncards. \n \nFor the primary analysis, the following two assessments will be made independently of each other and \nwithout regard to the outcomes in each case. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 3 \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nComparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials \n \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment approval, a population \nof placebo treated patients will be established to match those of the current study. For this population, \na median time to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms will be determined along with its 95% \nconfidence interval. \n \n\u2022 \nAssessment of relative efficacy \n \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in the median times \nto alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% confidence interval. The methodology will \nbe based on the use of the Hodges-Lehmann estimator in the case of censored data. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 4 \nTable of Contents\n1.

Influenza virus types A and B cause \nan acute febrile infection of the respiratory tract characterized by the sudden onset of \nfever, malaise, headaches, myalgias and cough. Influenza causes numerous deaths each \nyear [1]. Although difficult to assess, annual influenza epidemics are thought to result in \nbetween three and five million cases of severe illness, and between 250,000 and 500,000 \ndeaths every year around the world. [2] \nThe influenza viruses are segmented, negative sense, single stranded, lipid encapsulated, \nRNA viruses between 80 and 100 nm in size. Subtypes are defined according to \nglycoproteins present in the viral lipid coat. The haemagglutinin complex (HA) is the \nmajor surface protein of the virus. The neuraminidase (NA) protein is the second major \nsurface protein in the virion and plays a role in enhancing virus penetration of the mucus \nlayer around the target cell and in release of virus from the cell surface. The matrix \nproteins, M1 and M2 appear to trigger the disintegration of the M1 complex during virus \nfusion with the cell and may also be involved in the maturation of the HA prior to \nassembly of new virus particles.  \n1.1.1 \nInfluenza \nInfluenza infection is usually a self limiting condition. However, in children, the elderly \nand the immunocompromised, influenza infection can be associated with substantial \nmorbidity and mortality [1].  In patients with compromised immunity, influenza virus \nmay cause severe lower respiratory tract involvement; unusual syndromes, including \nencephalitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis and death. [3]  The availability of new \nimmunosuppressive agents has enhanced the number and survival of solid organ \ntransplant (SOT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) [4] recipients making \nthem representative of the larger immunocompromised patient population.   \nIn transplant recipients influenza is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary \ncomplications, extrapulmonary manifestations and an increased risk of graft dysfunction \nand high attributable mortality. In a cohort study of influenza viral infection in SOT \nsubjects, 30 cases of influenza viral infection were identified. Secondary bacterial \npneumonia was seen in 17 % of subjects and three SOT recipients (2 liver and one \nkidney) had myositis, myocarditis and bronchiolitis obliterans. Biopsy of the transplanted \norgan was performed in 21 of 30 cases and revealed variable degrees of acute allograft \nrejection in 62 % of subjects. The study concluded that influenza was associated with \nsignificant morbidity in different groups of SOT recipients [5]  \nAmong transplant recipients, subjects with HSCT are at the greatest risk for morbidity. In \na prospective study from the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the European Group \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 13 \nfor Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 1973 patients were evaluated for respiratory virus \ninfections after stem cell transplant.  The overall mortality was 23% from influenza A \ninfection and the direct influenza A-associated mortality was 15.3% in this study. [6] \nThe largest study of influenza infections in transplant (allogenic, syngenic or autologous \nHSCT) subjects comes from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, USA. In this \nretrospective study, influenza virus was isolated in 62 of 4797 subjects undergoing HSCT \nover a 13-year period. During this period, the Center had a standardized protocol for the \ndetection of respiratory pathogens comprising direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining \nand viral culture. Because capture of influenza infections and accurate ascertainment of \nall risk factors was less complete after discharge from the health care center, only \ninfections that occurred during the first 120 days after transplantation were considered. \nInfluenza was defined as the isolation of influenza virus by culture or as evidence of \ninfluenza antigen detected by DFA in conjunction with consistent symptomatology.  \nAntiviral treatment with an M2 inhibitor or oseltamivir (available since 1999) was \nperformed at the discretion of the investigator. Unlike the fixed dosing duration \nrecommended for antivirals in healthy subjects, in this trial, treatment was continued until \nresolution of presenting signs and symptoms and clearance of virus from respiratory \nsecretions. Garrett Nichols, et al, reported as many as 29 % of subjects developed \npneumonia following influenza infection in this large retrospective study. Ten percent of \nthe subjects with influenza died [7].  \nThe increased morbidity in transplant patients is associated with increased duration of \nvirus shedding compared to that in healthy subjects. In otherwise healthy adults, elderly \nsubjects and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated subjects was 70, \n96 and 118 hours respectively. [8] In contrast, in the retrospective HSCT study, influenza \nvirus was shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a median \nduration of 168 hours (7 days, range 2 to 37 days) [7]. This median duration of shedding \nincluded both allogenic and autologous HSCT subjects and both treated and untreated \nsubjects. The mean duration of shedding in treated and untreated allogenic HSCT \nsubjects was found to be longer than in autologous HSCT subjects (11.1 versus 6.7 days).  \nJohny et al, evaluated the use of zanamivir in the treatment of influenza in seven \nallogenic bone marrow transplant subjects. As with the large retrospective HSCT study, \ntheir standard of care also was to continue zanamivir until symptoms had subsided and it \nwas documented that viral excretion had ceased. Viral shedding was checked every 7 \ndays. Based on this protocol, the median duration of use of zanamivir was 15 days with a \nrange of 5 to 44 days. [9] \nCurrently available treatments for influenza infection are the M2 ion channel inhibitors \n(e.g. amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir, \nzanamivir). Due to the emergence of resistant virus, the Center for Disease Control \n(CDC) has made an interim recommendation that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be \nused for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in the United States. [10] Oseltamivir \nis therefore one of the main drugs available for the evaluation of the treatment of \ninfluenza in the immunocompromised population.  \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 14 \n1.1.2 \nOseltamivir \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Ro 64-0796) is an ethyl ester prodrug which is rapidly absorbed \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and metabolized in the liver by \nhigh capacity carboxylesterases to form oseltamivir carboxylate (Ro 64-0802), a potent, \nstable and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes. The active \nform, oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted unchanged by the kidney via glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion by the organic anion transport system. The efficacy \nand safety of oseltamivir in influenza treatment and prevention has been established in an \nextensive series of clinical studies in man. \nOseltamivir has been approved for the treatment of influenza in Europe, the United States \nand most other countries around the world. In adults and adolescents, the recommended \ndose is 75 mg twice daily for five days. In children 1 year of age and older recommended \ndoses are 30, 45 or 60 mg bid based on body weight. In all age groups the recommended \ndose is administered bid for 5 days.   \nThe approval of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza is based on several controlled \nclinical trials. In the pooled population from these clinical trials encompassing adults \naged from 13-97 years, many with significant co-morbidity, 1325 subjects were treated \nwith oseltamivir (75 mg bid) and 1056 subjects received placebo. A total of seven \ninfluenza symptoms (both respiratory and constitutional) were captured on the diary card \nfor adults. The time to resolution of all symptoms (on the diary card) decreased by 24 \nhours; from 124.5 hours in the placebo arm to 100.6 hours with oseltamivir 75 mg bid (p \n< 0.0001).  [8] Further, in adults and adolescents with a proven influenza illness, \noseltamivir treatment reduced overall antibiotic use for any reason by 26.7 % and the \nincidence of influenza-related lower respiratory tract complications resulting in antibiotic \ntherapy by 55 %. The study concluded that oseltamivir treatment of influenza reduces \nlower respiratory tract complications, antibiotic use and hospitalizations in healthy and \n\u2018at risk\u2019 subjects [11].   \nLikewise, in the influenza-infected pediatric population (1 to 12 years of age), oseltamivir \ntreatment (n = 217) was compared with placebo (n = 235). There was a reduction  in  the \nmedian duration of illness (defined based on resolution of temperature, cough, coryza and \nreturn to pre-illness health and activity) of 36 hours; from 137 hours with placebo to 101 \nhours in the oseltamivir treatment arm (p=<0.0001).  The Canadian Acute Respiratory \nInfections Scale (CARIFS), validated for use in children, was used to collect symptom \ndata on the pediatric diary card. The CARIFS scale comprised a total of 18 symptoms \nwhich were evaluated twice daily by the parent or guardian.  There was a similar \nreduction in the time to alleviation of all CARIFS symptoms of 36 hours; from 100 hours \nin the placebo group to 63 hours in the oseltamivir group (p < 0.0001) [12].  \nThus in both adults and children, the time to resolution of all symptoms was significantly \nreduced in the oseltamivir treatment arm compared with placebo.   \nOseltamivir was well-tolerated in clinical trials. Approximately 11,000 subjects have \nreceived oseltamivir in the development program. The most common adverse events \nreported by adults, the elderly, and children were nausea and vomiting. Serious adverse \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 15 \nevents (SAEs) were reported with a low and equal frequency by subjects taking active \ndrug and placebo. Full details are given in the Investigator Brochure. [8] \nThere have been no controlled studies of oseltamivir treatment or prophylaxis in \nimmunocompromised subjects. In the study by Garrett Nichols et al, patients who did not \nreceive antiviral therapy shed virus for longer periods (mean duration, 11.3 days) than did \nthose who were treated with M2 inhibitors (mean duration, 9.7 days) or neuraminidase \ninhibitors (mean duration, 7.5 days). Therapy with oseltamivir (but not rimantadine) \nappeared to be associated with shorter duration of shedding after controlling for steroid \ndose (p < 0.08). [7].  The efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza in the \nimmunocompromised population has also been demonstrated in other studies. In another \nsmall trial of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza infection in subjects following \nHSCT, only two patients (5.1 %) developed influenza-related pneumonia. [13] In this \nstudy, all 39 HSCT subjects with influenza were treated with antivirals (oseltamivir or \namantadine).  In as many as 43 % of subjects, the duration of illness was greater than 7 \ndays. This is unlike data from healthy adults, suggesting the possible need to evaluate a \nhigher dose and/or longer duration of treatment with oseltamivir for this population.    \nWhile the efficacy of antiviral agents for influenza has been demonstrated in the \notherwise healthy population, it has not been tested prospectively in the \nimmunocompromised (transplant) population. [4] There is therefore a need to confirm the \nefficacy of antiviral therapy for influenza in prospective controlled trials in this patient \npopulation.  \n1.2 \nRationale for the Study  \nThis study is designed to investigate the optimal therapy for influenza in \nimmunocompromised transplant recipients. \nThe rationale for conducting this study in the immunocompromised population is based \non the following: \n1. Immunocompromised subjects are at the highest risk for morbidity and mortality \nfrom influenza \n2. Immunocompromised subjects are at the greatest risk for contracting influenza \nbecause immunization may be ineffective in this population \n3. There is no drug approved for the treatment of influenza in this population \n2. \nOBJECTIVES  \n2.1 \nPrimary Objective \nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of oseltamivir \nfor the treatment of influenza in transplant recipients as measured by the time to \nresolution of influenza symptoms. \n2.2 \nSecondary Objectives   \nThe secondary objectives of the study are:  \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 16 \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and high dose oseltamivir in transplant recipients \non: \n\u2022 The clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis)  \n\u2022 The virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntime points) \n\u2022 Patient safety and tolerability   \n\u2022 The development of  resistant influenza virus \n\u2022 To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir (e.g. clearance, \nvolume of distribution) in transplant recipients  \n   \n3. \nSTUDY DESIGN \n3.1 \nOverview of Study Design and Dosing Regimen   \nThis is a double blind, randomized, stratified, multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy of \nconventional and high dose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in \nimmunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised transplant recipients who develop \nan influenza-like illness with a positive rapid diagnostic test for influenza, will be \nenrolled during the influenza season.  Patients will be stratified by type of transplant \n[SOT or HSCT], by the time between onset of symptoms and treatment start [\u2264 24 hours; \n> 24 hours], influenza vaccination status for current flu season [Yes; No] and by age [\u226412 \nyears; >12 years]. Eligible patients will be consented and randomized to receive \noseltamivir twice daily for 10 days in one of two treatment arms: conventional dose or \nhigh dose (double the conventional dose). The primary end point in the study is the time \nto alleviation of all symptoms.  \nIn this study, immunocompromised subjects will be represented by the transplant \npopulation. This is justified because the availability of new immunosuppressive agents \nhas enhanced the number and survival of SOT and HSCT recipients, making them \nrepresentative of the larger immunocompromised patient population.    \nHeterogeneity in the transplant population could confound the assessment of safety and \nefficacy in this study. Consequently, the SOT population in the protocol excludes \nsubjects with transplants other than liver, kidney or liver and kidney. However, in order \nto still be representative of the transplant community in particular and the \nimmunocompromised community in general, the study specifically includes subjects at \nthe greatest risk for morbidity and mortality from influenza - the HSCT subjects. The \nstudy also excludes subjects with comorbid conditions that might impact the metabolism \nand excretion of the drug. As the prodrug and active drug accumulate in the presence of \nhepatic and severe renal impairment respectively, subjects with hepatic or severe renal \nimpairment are excluded from the study.  Other comorbid conditions that might preclude \nthe assessment of efficacy and safety are also excluded from the study. These are \nreflected in several of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 17 \n3.1.1 \nRationale for Study Design \nThis study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo controlled \ntrials. At the outset, a patient population that represents the general immunocompromised  \npopulation had to be defined. As a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this \npopulation, an alternative control arm had to be identified. The response to placebo in \npivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was \nchosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial. In order to do this, the \ncurrent study design and end points were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal \nregistration trials. The following sections provide rationale and justification for the \nspecific aspects of the study design. They also provide information on how the results \nwill be used to make recommendations on dose and duration of treatment. \n3.1.1.1 \nChoice of treatment arms \nThe pivotal registration trials for oseltamivir in healthy adults with influenza had three \ntreatment arms, two active (75 mg and 150 mg) and one placebo. Both treatment arms \nwere found to be significantly better than placebo. No statistical comparisons were made \nbetween the two active treatment arms. Evaluation of the results in the two active \ntreatment arms did not reveal any clinically meaningful difference. Based on these \nstudies, the approved (conventional) dose for the treatment of influenza in adults is 75 \nmg. \nA similar trial design was envisaged for this immunocompromised population. In an \nimmunocompromised population there is a possibility of increased efficacy with a higher \ndose. In the trials in healthy adults, on day 4 (3 days after the start of treatment), the \nproportion of subjects shedding virus suggested a possible dose response relationship \n(36%, 28% and 23% in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg dose arms respectively). In \nhealthy adults, this difference in the rate of viral shedding did not translate to any \ndifference in clinical response in the two active treatment arms even though both active \ntreatment \narms \nwere \nsignificantly \nbetter \nthan \nthe \nplacebo \narm. \nIn \nthe \nimmunocompromised population too it is possible that while there might not be any \ndifference between the two active treatment arms, one or both of these dose arms may be \nbetter than placebo. In this immunocompromised population, there is therefore an even \ngreater need to evaluate the efficacy of a higher dose arm.  \nAs with the trials in healthy adults, the ideal trial design for the current study would be \none that compared efficacy of the conventional and high dose arms with placebo. \nHowever, as reviewed in an earlier section 1.1.1 the morbidity and mortality from \ninfluenza in the immunocompromised population is far greater than that in healthy adults. \nThus in one study as many as 29 % of subjects with HSCT developed pneumonia \nfollowing influenza infection. [7] In another study in SOT recipients, biopsy of the \ntransplanted organ revealed variable degrees of acute allograft rejection in 62 % of \nsubjects. [5] Given the extent of morbidity, a placebo control appears unethical. This is \nfurther supported by a feasibility survey conducted by the Sponsor which demonstrated  \nthat a majority of transplant sites actually used antivirals (including oseltamivir) to treat \ninfluenza in this population. It was therefore decided to compare the conventional and \nhigher dose arms with the placebo arm from the pivotal registration trials in healthy \nadults with influenza. Although this approach poses limitations, the Sponsor has made \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 18 \nevery effort to make sure that the results from such an approach are still meaningful. The \nfollowing sections describe how the study design addresses these limitations.  \n3.1.1.2 \nConsistency with previous influenza treatment studies \nIn order to be able to compare the study findings with the response to placebo in healthy \nadults, this study has been intentionally designed to be consistent with previous \nregistration trials for treatment of influenza in healthy adults. Some of the key design \nfeatures consistent with previous studies include: two active treatment arms, subjects with \ninfluenza like symptoms recruited during the flu season, use of a diary card to capture \nsymptoms, primary clinical end point based on diary card assessments, laboratory \nevaluation of virology and serology samples generally similar to previous trials and the \nprimary efficacy analysis population is the Intent to treat Infected (ITTI) population. \nDespite the above considerations, there are issues that can preclude the estimation of the \nresponse to placebo in an immunocompromised population comprising adults and \nchildren from that in healthy adults with influenza. To further mitigate this, the choice of \nendpoints and their interpretation is vital.    \n3.1.1.3 \nInterpretation of study results  \nChoice of primary end point and comparators \nThe current study includes both children and adults. This is because of the significant \nunmet need in both these age groups. The primary end point therefore had to be \napplicable to both age groups. In registration trials in adults, the primary end point was \nthe time to resolution of all clinical symptoms (in the diary card). In registration trials in \nchildren, the primary end point was the reduction in the median duration of illness \n(defined based on temperature, cough, coryza and return to pre-illness health and \nactivity). A key secondary end point in children \u2013 time to resolution of all clinical \nsymptoms showed similar results. The primary endpoint in this study is the time to \nresolution (alleviation) of all symptoms. \n The median of the primary end point in the active treatment groups (conventional and \nhigh dose) in this trial will be compared with the median of the time to resolution of \nsymptoms in the placebo group from the pivotal registration trials. The high dose arm \nenables the detection of a possible dose response relationship in this immune \ncompromised population. As a means to evaluate that possibility, an assessment of the \nrelative efficacy of the two dose groups will be made in terms of median time to \nalleviation of symptoms. Section 8.2.5 provides details on the statistical considerations \nand their rationale associated with these comparisons. \nEffect of study design on efficacy end points \nThe main limitations of using the response to placebo from previous trials to estimate the \nresponse in this trial are due to the different populations (healthy versus \nimmunocompromised), age groups (adults versus adults and children) and the potential \ndifference in virulence of different strains. The potential difference in virulence of the \npredominant influenza viruses may be a confounder whose contribution can not be \nestimated. However the difference in populations and age groups is likely to result in the \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 19 \nplacebo response from pivotal registration trials underestimating the time to alleviation in \nthe immunocompromised population. This is because the time to alleviation of symptoms \nis shorter in the healthy population compared to the immunocompromised population. \n[13] The placebo response in the pivotal trials will therefore underestimate the response \nin the current trial. The Sponsor is thus using a very conservative approach in comparing \nthe active treatment arms in this study with the response to placebo in healthy subjects. If \none/both of the treatment arms is statistically better than placebo, it is considered that this \nis a meaningful effect for this population.  If both treatment arms are not different from \nplacebo and this is seen consistently across several end points, it may be hypothesized \nthat the risk from influenza for the immunocompromised population treated with \noseltamivir is comparable to that for a healthy untreated adult with influenza.   \nPossible dosing recommendations based on current study \nHealthy subjects who were given placebo in the previous pivotal oseltamivir treatment \nstudies will be used as the control arm for this study.  When the two active treatment \narms are compared with this placebo control, several outcomes are possible. These \noutcomes will need to be discussed with health authorities.  Some outcomes and possible \ninterpretations of the results are presented below:   \n1. Conventional and high dose are both shown to be better than placebo: Both treatment \narms will be compared.  If no difference then the conventional dose would be the \ndose recommended for treatment in this population.  If a difference is seen between \ntreatment arms, then an evaluation (including benefit/risk assessment) will be made to \nconfirm whether the higher dose should be the recommended dose. \n2. One active treatment arm is superior to placebo while the other is not: In this instance \nthe dose that is shown to be superior will be recommended unless other \nconsiderations such as safety dictate otherwise.  \n3. Both conventional and high dose arms are not different from placebo: If this is seen \nconsistently across several secondary clinical end points, it may be hypothesized that \noseltamivir has reduced the risk in the immunocompromised population to the more \nacceptable level in the untreated healthy adult population. \n4. It is also possible that both conventional and high dose treatment have a more \nprotracted clinical course than the placebo arm. In this situation, it may be difficult to \nmake conclusions about efficacy.  \n \nIrrespective of the efficacy outcomes, the study will still provide useful information of \nthe safety of oseltamivir in this population.  \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 20 \nPossible recommendations for duration of treatment based on the current study \nOnce a dose is chosen a determination will need to be made on whether the \nrecommended duration of treatment should be 5 or 10 days or longer. This decision will \nbe based both on the clinical and virologic course of influenza.   \nThe recommended duration of treatment for influenza in healthy adults is five days. In \nthis study, the duration of dosing is ten days because viral shedding is typically longer in \nthe immunocompromised population than in healthy adults. The general standard of care \nfor this population has been to treat for as long as the patient continues to shed virus \n(even after the resolution of symptoms) [7] [9]. The duration of treatment for this \npopulation is therefore individualized based on clinical response and duration of viral \nshedding. It can often be more than 10 days. While it is possible that 10 or more days of \ntreatment may be needed [7] [9], it is also possible that 5 days of treatment may still be \nadequate. Therefore, in this study the clinical and virologic course (proportion shedding \nvirus at day 6 and later) will be evaluated to make recommendations on the duration of \ndosing. No statistical comparisons will be made.     \nStratification \nStratification in this study has no bearing on any comparisons with results from previous \ntrials. However, in order to evaluate a dose response relationship between the two active \ntreatment arms in this trial, stratification remains essential.  \nBecause HSCT recipients are at the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality from \ninfluenza, patients will be stratified by transplant type (SOT versus HSCT). Patients will \nbe stratified by time between onset of symptoms and treatment start (< 24 hours or \u2265 24 \nhours) because previous experience in otherwise healthy adults and children has shown \nthat patients treated early in their illness respond to treatment better than those who are \ntreated later. Patients will also be stratified by age ( \u2264 12 years and > 12 years) because \notherwise healthy children shed virus longer than otherwise healthy adults. It is expected \nthat a similar difference in the duration of viral shedding would exist between \nimmunocompromised children and adults. As vaccinated subjects may respond faster to \ntherapy, the study is also stratified based on influenza vaccination status for the current \nflu season (Yes; No).   \n3.1.2 \nRationale for Dose Selection and Adjustment \nDose Selection \nThe dose of oseltamivir to be used in this study is the conventional, approved dose for \nchildren and adults in the treatment of influenza. There will be a second higher dose for \ncomparison which is two times the conventional dose. This higher dose is used based on \ntheoretical considerations which suggest that the higher dose may be associated with \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance.  \nThe anticipated pro-drug and metabolite exposures from this higher dose are not expected \nto exceed maximum exposures seen previously in the oseltamivir development program. \nThe safety and tolerability of the higher dose regimen has already been demonstrated in \ntreatment studies of immunocompetent adult subjects (n = 447). [14] In a study to \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 21 \ndemonstrate cardiac safety, in the highest dose group treated with 450 mg b.i.d. for 5 \ndays [n = 99], no subject had a serious adverse event, nor withdrew prematurely. In Phase \nI studies in adults, oseltamivir has been administered in multiple doses of up to 500 mg \nb.i.d. Doses of 200 mg b.i.d. and greater have been associated with increased \ngastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea and vomiting). [8] In adult subjects with \ncreatinine clearances of < 30 mL/min, doses of 100 mg b.i.d. for 6 days were well \ntolerated, despite steady-state oseltamivir carboxylate exposures approximately 10-fold \nhigher than those achieved with standard dosing in renally competent individuals. [15] \nNo other adverse effects were reported more frequently with higher doses and no serious \nadverse events have been reported within the volunteer studies. Co-administration of \noseltamivir with food has been demonstrated to substantially reduce the frequency and \nseverity of gastrointestinal side effects.  \nThus, the rationale for the higher dose arm in this study is to explore the possibility of \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance without an undue increase in \nrisk.  \nDrug interactions with immunosuppressive medications have also been evaluated. The \npharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate after administration of \n75 mg oseltamivir (conventional adult dose) in subjects with a well-functioning, stable \nrenal allograft who were being maintained on immunosuppressive therapy were studied. \nThese were similar to those described in the literature for adults with comparable degrees \nof renal function. Oseltamivir was well tolerated and had no clinically relevant effect on \nthe steady-state pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate \nmofetil. [8] \nDuration of dosing \nThe duration of dosing chosen for this population (10 days) is longer than that in the \nhealthy adult and pediatric populations (5 days). This is based on observations that the \nviral shedding and illness are typically longer in immunocompromised patients than it is \nin healthy adults. [7] [13] \nDose Adjustments \nIn this study, dose adjustment for subjects with an estimated Cr Cl between 10 to 30 \nmL/min/1.73M2 will comprise decreasing the frequency of administration to once daily. \nThis is based on current label recommendations for adults with renal impairment \n(Table 1). \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 22 \nTable 1 \nRecommended doses in healthy adults for treatment of \ninfluenza  \n \nCreatinine Clearance \nRecommended dose for treatment \n> 30 (ml/min) \n75 mg twice daily \n> 10 to \u2264 30 (ml/min) \n75 mg once daily or 30 mg suspension twice \ndaily \n\u226410 (ml/min)   \nNot recommended \ndialysis patients \nNot recommended \n \nThe dose adjustment recommendations are considered suitable approaches for children \nwith renal impairment. This is based on the reasonable assumption that a similar \nrelationship exists in both children and adults, between changes in creatinine clearance \nand resultant changes in exposure of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. Doses will \nbe adjusted for renal impairment in this protocol per the schema below. More detailed \ninformation on dosing, dose adjustments and maintenance of the blind are provided in \nlater sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3. \nTable 2 \nRecommended dose modifications for NV 20234 trial \nsubjects \n \nRandomized Dose \nArm \nUnit dose \n(mg) \nCreatinine Clearance \n(ml/min OR ml/min/M2) \nDose frequency \n> 30 \nTwice daily \n30 \n> 10 to \u2264 30 \nOnce daily \n> 30 \nTwice daily \n45 \n> 10 to \u2264 30 \nOnce daily \n> 30 \nTwice daily \n60 \n> 10 to \u2264 30 \nOnce daily \n> 30 \nTwice daily \n \n \n \nConventional \n \n75 \n> 10 to \u2264 30 \nOnce daily \n> 30 \nTwice daily \n60 \n> 10 to \u2264 30 \nOnce daily \n> 30 \nTwice daily \n90 \n> 10 to \u2264 30 \nOnce daily \n> 30 \nTwice daily \n120 \n> 10 to \u2264 30 \nOnce daily \n> 30 \nTwice daily \n \n \n \nHigh \n150 \n> 10 to \u2264 30 \nOnce daily \n \nIn general, no dose adjustment is considered necessary in subjects with mild-moderate \nhepatic impairment (based on pharmacokinetic findings in adults with chronic hepatic \nimpairment) receiving usual therapeutic doses of oseltamivir. [16] However, as the \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 23 \nrelevance of these findings to the specific patient population in this study is unclear, \nsubjects with overt (based on physical signs and symptoms) hepatic impairment at \nbaseline will be excluded from this study as mentioned in section 4.3. \n3.1.3 \nEnd of Study   \nThe study comprises 10 days of treatment with follow up visits approximately 5 and 30 \ndays later as shown in the schedule of assessments. A rapid diagnostic test for influenza \nwill be performed at the end of the 10 days of treatment. Subjects still having influenza \nbased on the rapid diagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care by the \nprincipal investigator.  \n3.2 \nNumber of Subjects/ Assignment to Treatment Groups \nA total of approximately 250 patients will be enrolled in this study (approximately 125 \nper arm). After screening, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two active \ntreatment groups. \n3.3 \nCenters \nThis will be a multicenter study with approximately 140 centers in the Northern \nhemisphere. Centers will be activated to recruit patients during the influenza season. The \ncenters to be included in the study are those which perform or manage SOTs, HSCTs or \nboth.  \n4. \nSTUDY POPULATION \n4.1 \nOverview   \nThe study population comprises immunocompromised adults (including adolescents) and \nchildren who have influenza. Additionally, the subjects must not have other medical \nconditions that will preclude the assessment of efficacy or safety. Influenza vaccinated \nand non-vaccinated subjects are eligible to participate in this study.  \nUnder no circumstances are patients who enroll in this study permitted to be re-\nrandomized to this study and enrolled for a second course of treatment. \n4.2 \nInclusion Criteria  \n\u2022 Age greater than or equal to 1 year \n\u2022 Rapid diagnostic test positive for influenza in the 24 hours prior to first dose \n\u2022 Immunocompromised subject defined as documented: \n\u2022 SOT (liver, kidney or both) recipient OR \n\u2022 Allogenic HSCT  \n\u2022 Receiving ongoing immunosuppression, OR, in the investigator\u2019s opinion, not \nimmune reconstituted \n\u2022 Symptoms suggestive of influenza like illness including, but not limited to fever, \ncough, or coryza  \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 24 \n\u2022 Less than or equal to 48 hours between onset of influenza like illness and first dose of \nstudy drug  \n\u2022 Acceptable renal function defined as: \n\u2022 Most recent creatinine clearance in the 6 months prior to randomization is \n> 30 ml/min in adults and > 30 ml/min /1.73M2  in children.

Concomitant use of an investigational drug during the study is \nalso excluded. Influenza vaccination after randomization is not allowed. Live attenuated \nvaccines may not be advisable for this population. It is possible that concurrent use with \noseltamivir may render live vaccines ineffective.  \nMedications required for the routine care of the patient including those required for \nmanagement of the transplant (excluding lymphocyte depleting antibodies, intravenous \nimmunoglobulins) may be continued during the study. Concomitant use of probenecid \n(irrespective of the indication) is not allowed during the study. \n4.5 \nCriteria for Premature Withdrawal  \nThe investigator should discontinue treatment if the creatinine clearance is < 10 ml/min \nin adults or < 10 ml/min/1.73 M2 in children. The investigator should also discontinue \ntreatment from all subjects with intercurrent illnesses or adverse events suggestive of \nhepatic decompensation. The investigator also has the right to discontinue treatment in \nthe event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, treatment failure, protocol violations, \nadministrative reasons or other reasons. \nSubjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  \nAn excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, \nunnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided. Should a subject decide to \nwithdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations prior to \nwithdrawal as thoroughly as possible. \nThe investigator should contact the subject or a responsible relative either by telephone or \nthrough a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the \nwithdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient\u2019s withdrawal should be \nmade with an explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study. If the reason \nfor removal of a subject from the study is an Adverse Event, the principal specific event \nwill be recorded on the CRF. \nIn the case that the subject decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment [\u201crefuses \ntreatment\u201d], he/she should be asked if he/she can still be contacted for further \ninformation. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical \nrecords and in the CRF.  \n4.6 \nReplacement Policy [Ensuring Adequate Numbers of \nEvaluable Subjects] \n4.6.1 \nFor Subjects \nNo subject prematurely discontinued from the study for any reason will be replaced.   \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 27 \n4.6.2 \nFor Centers \nA center may be replaced for the following administrative reasons:   \n\u2013 Excessively slow recruitment. \n\u2013 Poor protocol adherence \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 28 \n5. \nSCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES \nTable 3 \nSchedule of Assessments \n \nBaseline \nTreatment \nFollow-up \nStudy Day \n1 (pre-\ndose) \n1 \n2 or 3f \n6 g \n8 f, g \n11g, h, i \n15g   \n40 g, j \nInformed Consent/Assent \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMedical history  \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDemographics \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHeight and weight \nx \n \n \n \n \nx \n \n \nPregnancy Test a \nx \n \n \n \n \nx \n \nx \nRapid diagnostic test for \ninfluenza virus shedding  \nx \n \n \n \n \n \nx \n \n \nSafety Labs b \nx \n \n \n \n \nx \n \n \nSerology for influenza antibody \ntiter  \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \nx \nPK samplingc \n \nx \n \nx \n \nx \n \n \nPhysical Examination \nx \n \n \n \n \nx \n \nx \nVital Signs (including PR, RR, \ntemperature, Blood pressure) \nx \n \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nNasal and throat swabs for viral \nshedding and viral loadd \nx \n \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nReview of diary card e    \n \n \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nDrug Administration \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCollection of unused study \nmedication and empty containers \n \n \n \n \n \nx \n \n \nPrevious Diseases  \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrevious/Concomitant \nmedications \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdverse Events/Sec Illnesses and \nTreatments \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRejection, GVHD \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na.

Subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely will have an end of treatment (day 11) assessment at the time of \ntreatment discontinuation or the following day. They will be required to attend their follow up visits approximately 5 \nand 30 days after the last dose (day 15 and day 40 assessments).  \nj. Subjects who discontinue during follow-up will have an end of follow-up (day 40)  assessment. This visit must occur  \nwithin 30 days of the last dose.   \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 29 \n5.1 \nScreening Examination and Eligibility Screening Form  \nTrial sites will be activated during the influenza season.  \nAll subjects must provide written informed consent (assent where applicable) before any \nstudy specific assessments or procedures are performed. Screening will take place at the \nbaseline visit prior to first dose. \nSubjects will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria and those who fulfill all the \ninclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study.  \nAn Eligibility Screening Form [ESF] documenting the investigator\u2019s assessment of each \nscreened subject with regard to the protocol\u2019s inclusion and exclusion criteria is to be \ncompleted by the investigator. \nA screen failure log must be maintained by the investigator.  \n5.2 \nProcedures for Enrollment of Eligible Subjects  \nOnce a subject has fulfilled the entry criteria, he/she will be randomized to one of two \ntreatment groups. The subject randomization numbers will be generated by Roche or its \ndesignee and incorporated into double-blind labeling. \nThe investigator or designee will use the CRF pre-printed with the assigned subject \nnumber and enter the randomization number provided by IVRS for allocation to the \ntreatment groups in the appropriate place on each subject\u2019s CRF. \nRandomization will be stratified by transplant type (SOT or HSCT); time between onset \nof symptoms and treatment start (\u2264 24 hrs or > 24 hrs), influenza vaccination status (Yes; \nNo) and patient\u2019s age (\u2264 12 years or > 12 years).  \n5.3 \nClinical Assessments and Procedures \nAt all visits subjects will receive the routine care for their primary illness (transplant). \nRoutine patient care (including the adjustment of doses of any of the immunosuppressive \ndrugs) will be dictated by tests performed locally at the trial site. Dose adjustments of \noseltamivir will be based on serum creatinine done at the local laboratory. All safety labs \nwill be sent to a central laboratory. Results for these laboratory parameters will be used \nby the sponsor/designee to assess overall safety. \nAll assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of \nAssessments (Table 3). Additional information regarding these procedures not provided \nin the Schedule of Assessments is provided below. \nStudy Day 1 \nThe baseline and study day 1 assessment may be performed at the same visit. \nStudy medication, diary cards, and thermometers will be dispensed. Patients or \nguardians/parents will be instructed how to complete symptom diary cards (Appendix 2) \n(Appendix 3), temperature recording, and treatment administration details, including time \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 30 \nof each oseltamivir dose and food intake. The first diary card will be completed before \nthe first dose of study drug.  \nThe date of the first dose of study drug is defined as study day 1. Once randomized, the \nfirst dose of study drug will be administered in the clinic. Study day 2 will begin at 12 \nmidnight of the same calendar day. If the first dose of study drug is taken after 4 pm on \nday 1, the next dose of study drug will be taken in the morning of day 2. In this case, the \nlast dose of study drug will be taken on the morning of study day 11.   \nIf the first dose of study drug is taken prior to 4 pm on day 1, the next dose of study drug \nshould be taken in the evening of the same day (i.e. prior to midnight on the same \ncalendar day with a minimum of 7 hours between doses). For these patients the last dose \nof study drug will be taken in the evening of study day 10. More information on dosing is \nprovided later. (6.1) \nThe study will utilize a central safety laboratory. However, to determine the correct dose, \na local serum creatinine will be drawn at baseline in all subjects and used to calculate \ncreatinine clearance to determine if a dose adjustment is necessary. No dose adjustments \nare required for subjects whose creatinine clearance is > 30 ml/min in adults (> 30 \nml/min/1.73 M2  in children). Oseltamivir dosing frequency for patients whose creatinine \nclearance is between 10 to 30 ml/min in adults (10 to 30 ml/min/1.73 M2  in children) \nwill be adjusted to once daily.  \nFor patients who meet the following criteria in section 4.2, dosing will commence only \nafter the baseline creatinine clearance are available and if baseline creatinine clearance > \n10 ml/min in adults and > 10 ml/min/1.73M2  in children.  The dose will be adjusted to \nonce daily if the baseline Cr Cl is between 10 to 30 ml/min in adults (10 to 30 \nml/min/1.73 M2  in children) \n\u2022 most recent creatinine clearance in the 6 months prior is < 30  ml/min in adults and < \n30 ml/min/1.73M2 in children)  \n\u2022 patients who have not had a creatinine clearance assessment in the 6 months prior to \nrandomization \n \nFor patients who meet the following criteria in section 4.2 dosing may commence prior to \navailability of baseline Cr Cl. Subjects will receive twice daily doses and dosing will be \nadjusted to once daily if the baseline Cr Cl is between 10 to 30 ml/min in adults (10 to 30 \nml/min/1.73 M2  in children).  \n\u2022 most  recent creatinine clearance in the 6 months prior is > 30 ml/min  in  adults  and \n> 30 ml/min /1.73M2  in children) \n \nBlood samples will be taken for PK analysis as mentioned in section 5.5.1. \nStudy Days 2 - 11 \nStudy day 2 will begin at 12 midnight of study day 1.  \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 31 \nIt is expected the study staff will maintain close contact with patients, especially during \nthe first few days of the study. The study staff should inquire about any adverse events, \ncheck that the patient or parent/guardian is completing the diary cards, and assess drug \ncompliance. During the dosing period, diary card symptoms should be assessed and \ntemperature should be recorded at the same time that the study drug is taken.  \nDosage adjustment will be performed based on creatinine clearance as described in the \nDose Modification section 6.1.1. \nEnd of treatment Day 11 \nThe end of treatment visit for all subjects is on day 11 (irrespective of whether they took \none or two doses on day 1). Subjects who discontinue study medication prematurely  will \nhave all day 11 assessments completed at the time of discontinuation or the following \nday.  \nAfter all day 11 study assessments are completed, a rapid diagnostic test will be \nperformed at this visit. If the rapid diagnostic test is positive, the subject may be treated \nper standard of care at the discretion of the investigator.  \nAll subjects (including those who discontinue study medication prematurely and those \nwho are positive for influenza on their rapid diagnostic  test at the end of treatment visit) \nwill be required to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose \n(day 15 and day 40 assessments)    \nStudy days 12 \u2013 40 \nStudy day 15 is an important visit as it is the first assessment of viral culture after \ncessation of treatment.  \nEnd of Follow-Up Day 40  \nAll subjects must attend an end of follow-up visit on day 40. This visit is important as it  \nis the only post-baseline visit where a serology sample for influenza antibody titers is \ncollected.  \nIf the patient is withdrawn after completion of treatment (after the day 11 assessment),  a \ntermination visit should be arranged. This visit should be the end of follow-up visit \nassessment [Day 40]. This visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.  \nPatients or parents/guardians who do not return to the clinic will be contacted by \ntelephone to ascertain their health status, or that of their child\u2019s, record information on \nadverse events, and to ask that they return the symptom diary card. \n5.3.1 \nEfficacy Assessments  \nThe primary end point in this study is the time to resolution of all influenza symptoms as \nrecorded in the diary cards.  \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 32 \n1. Symptoms of influenza-like illness. These are captured in the diary card for both \nadults and children. (Appendix 2) (Appendix 3) Influenza symptoms are graded on a \nnominal scale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem). A score \nof zero is considered asymptomatic. The primary end point, time to alleviation of all \nsymptoms is comprised of all the symptoms captured in the diary card.  \n2. Temperature. This is captured on the diary card. Temperature is used for assessment \nof the primary and several secondary end points.  \n5.3.2 \nSafety  \nSafety parameters in this study include adverse events, vital signs, and clinical laboratory \nevaluations.  \nPre-defined symptoms of influenza captured in the adult and pediatric diary cards are not \nto be reported as adverse events unless they can be further qualified. Thus \u2018headache due \nto stress at work\u2019 is reported as an adverse event. However, unexplained \u2018headache\u2019 is \nconsidered a predefined symptom related to influenza and not an adverse event.  \nAdverse events such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis are considered \nsecondary illnesses of influenza and should be recorded as adverse events. \nOther adverse events to be expected in the transplant population such as rejection and \ngraft versus host disease (in HSCT subjects) will also be collected as adverse events.  \n5.4 \nLaboratory Assessments \nThe laboratory assessments include those for efficacy and safety. \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza. \nThese are: \nNasal and throat swabs. Two nasal and one throat swab will be collected as described in \nthe Schedule of Assessments. All swabs are sent to a central laboratory for RT-PCR and \nviral cultures. A phenotypic assay will be performed to determine the susceptibility of the \nlast positive viral isolate from each patient. If required, a genotypic assay to determine \nthe contribution of both the neuraminidase and haemagglutinin genes to decreased \nsusceptibility will be performed.  \nDuring the course of treatment, neither the investigator nor the patient will know which \nparticipants have ongoing positive viral cultures for influenza. However at the end of \ntreatment (day 11), a rapid diagnostic test is permitted for the diagnosis of ongoing \ninfluenza.  \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum \nchemistry and hematology will be done at the central laboratory. Serum chemistry \nassessments comprise AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea and creatinine. Hematology \nassessments include CBC and differential count. The total volume of blood loss for \nlaboratory assessments (other than pharmacokinetic sampling) will be approximately 20 \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 33 \nmL for the entire duration of the study. Blood loss for pharmacokinetic sampling is \nexplained in section 5.5.1. \nProtection of patient confidentiality, section 16 will extend to any data generated from the \nassaying of these samples. Biological samples taken from all patients may be infectious \nand will be classified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nThe Principal Investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be assessed at the local \nlaboratory at any time during the study. The Principal Investigator may use the creatinine \nlevels to calculate creatinine clearance and adjust dose of study drug if required. \n5.5 \nPharmacokinetic Assessments [PK] /Pharmacodynamic [PD] \nAssessments  \nBlood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir \naccording to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3) and as described below. Further \ndetails on PK/PD are to be found in sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.  \n5.5.1 \nPharmacokinetic Assessments [PK] \nPlasma PK samples for assessment of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will be \ncollected using the following sparse sampling approach: \n       day 1  (2 \u2018early\u2019 samples: 1 \u2013 4 hours post dose but at least 1 hour apart) \n       day 6  (2 \u2018late\u2019 samples: 4 \u2013 12 hours post dose but at least 1 hour apart) \n       day 11 (2 \u2018early\u2019 samples on day 11)*  \n*Note: Subjects should attend the clinic as early as possible on the morning of Day 11. \nFor those subjects who had their last dose on the morning of Day 11, they should have 2 \nsamples drawn 1\u2013 4 hours post dose but at least 1 hour apart. For those subjects who \nreceived their last dose on the evening of Day 10, they should have 2 samples drawn at \nleast 1 hour apart, as early as possible on the morning of day 11.  \nFor adults and adolescents, approximately 2 mL of blood will be taken at each time point, \ntherefore the total volume blood loss for pharmacokinetic assessments will be \napproximately 12 mL. For pediatric subjects, not less than approximately 0.6 mL of \nblood will be taken at each time point, as a result the total volume blood loss for \npharmacokinetic assessments will be approximately 3.6 mL. \n5.5.2 \nPharmacodynamic [PD] Assessments \nNasal and throat swabs will be collected from individuals on the days specified in the \nschedule of assessments. Specimens will be cultured at a central laboratory. The \nproportion of patients with viral shedding at each visit will be summarized. \n6. \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \nThe Investigational Medical Product in this study is oseltamivir dry powder (to be \nreconstituted to a concentration of 12 mg/ml) or 75 mg capsules and matching placebo. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 34 \nThe Investigational Medicinal Products will be supplied, packaged individually for each \nsubject and labeled in accordance with Roche Standard and local regulation by Roche \nClinical Trial Supply, Basel, Switzerland.  \n6.1 \nDose and Schedule of Study Drug \nOseltamivir will be given twice daily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses. The doses need \nto be taken at 12 hourly intervals. Under no circumstances is a subject allowed to take \ntwo doses within 7 hours of each other.  \nPatients will be randomized to receive either conventional or high dose of study drug. \nConventional dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup \n\u2264 15 kg  \n \n \n30 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg   \n \n45 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg  \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg \n \n \n75 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years): Oseltamivir capsules  \n75 mg twice daily \nSubjects randomized to the conventional dose will simultaneously receive matching \nplacebo so as to blind them and the investigator from the high dose arm.  \n \nHigh dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup  \n\u2264 15 kg  \n \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg   \n \n90 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg  \n \n120 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg \n \n \n150 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years): Oseltamivir capsules  \n150 mg twice daily  \n6.1.1 \nDose Modifications   \nNo dose adjustments/modifications are required for subjects whose creatinine clearance is \n> 30 ml/min in adults (> 30 ml/min/1.73 M2  in children). \nIn both treatment arms, the dosing frequency will be decreased to once daily in patients \nwith severe renal impairment (Cr Cl in adults between 10 \u2013 30 ml/min and children \nbetween 10 \u2013 30 ml/min/1.73M2). For example, the 75 mg bid frequency will be \ndecreased to 75 mg once daily.  \nAt any time during the study if the investigator feels that renal function is compromised, \ndosing may be decreased to once daily or withheld until such time creatinine clearance \nresults are available. Dosing may then be resumed as appropriate based on the creatinine \nclearance. However, it is vital that dosing not be inappropriately withheld for extended \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 35 \nperiods of time especially in the first 3 days of treatment when viral titers may be high. It \nis also important that dose modifications are clearly and accurately recorded for \nassessment of pharmacokinetic results.  \nFor adolescents and children, the creatinine clearance will be estimated using a Schwarz \nequation: (Appendix 1) \nFor adults the method of Cockcroft-Gault will be used to estimate creatinine clearance. \n(Appendix 1) \n6.2 \nPreparation and Administration of Study Drug  \nOseltamivir will be provided in two forms:  \n1. Capsules containing 75 mg of active drug and packaging material consisting of \npregelatinized starch, povidone, talc and sodium stearyl fumarate. All participants 13 \nyears and older will receive this dosage form. Oseltamivir capsules should be stored \nat 25\u00baC.  \n2. A pediatric suspension containing 12 mg oseltamivir per ml of reconstituted solution \nand the following excipients: sorbitol, titanium dioxide, sodium benzoate, xanthan \ngum, monosodium citrate, saccharin sodium and Permaseal11900-31 Tutti Frutti \n(flavor). All participants 12 years and under will receive this dosage form. \nOseltamivir dry powder for suspension [pediatric syrup] should be stored at 25\u00baC.  \nAfter reconstitution, the suspension should not be used for longer than 10 days. Store \nconstituted suspension under refrigeration at 2\u00ba to 8\u00baC.  Do not freeze. \n \nMatching placebo will be available as capsules and suspension. Subjects in the \nconventional dose arm will get the conventional dose and matching placebo so that they \nare blinded from the high dose arm.  \nEach subject will be dispensed a medication pack that will provide enough medication to \ncover 20 doses. For subjects randomized to the conventional dose arm, the medication \npack will contain a bottle of oseltamivir dry powder or a blister wallet with oseltamivir \ncapsules and matching placebo. For subjects randomized to the high dose arm, the \nmedication pack will contain two bottles of oseltamivir dry powder or two blister wallets \nwith oseltamivir capsules. Irrespective of the treatment group the subject is randomized \nto, for each dose the subject will take the same amount from both bottles or blister wallets \nprovided in the medication pack such that the sum of the amounts from each immediate \ncontainer constitutes one dose. \nOne dose is to be administered twice per day at approximately 12-hour intervals with a \nlight snack or glass of milk or fruit juice. The first dose of study medication will be \nadministered in the clinic at the time of randomization. \n6.3 \nBlinding and Unblinding \nRandomization will be administered by a central randomization center.  \nThe Randomization List will not be available at the study center, to the study monitors, \nproject statisticians or to the project team at Roche. Emergency codes, or another \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 36 \nadequate method of unblinding, will be implemented before study start, if the identity of \nthe test medication is necessary for patient management in the case of a serious adverse \nevent. Emergency codes should not be broken except in the case of emergency situations. \nAny request from the investigator for information about the treatment administered to \nstudy subjects for another purpose must be discussed with Roche/designee.  \nAs per regulatory reporting requirement, Roche/designee will unblind the identity of the \nstudy medication for all unexpected [as per IB] serious adverse events that are considered \nby the investigator to be related to study drug. Details of patients who are unblinded \nduring the study will be included in the Clinical Study Report. \nAll other individuals directly involved in this study will remain blinded until the final \nanalysis of the primary parameter.  \nThe randomization will be stratified by transplant type, duration of symptoms, influenza \nvaccination status and age and will be provided by the Roche randomization group for the \nIVRS vendor.  \n6.4 \nAssessment of Compliance \nAccountability and subject compliance will be assessed by maintaining adequate \u201cdrug \ndispensing\u201d and return records.  \nSubjects will be asked to return all used and unused drug supply containers at the end of \nthe treatment as a measure of compliance.  \nA Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should contain the following \ninformation: \n\u2022 the identification of the subject [randomization and medication numbers] to whom the \nstudy medication was dispensed \n\u2022 the date[s], quantity of the study medication dispensed to the subject \n\u2022 the date[s] and quantity of the study medication returned by the subject \nThis inventory must be available for inspection by the Monitor. All supplies, including \npartially used or empty containers and the dispensing logs, must be returned to the \nmonitor at the end of the study. \n6.5 \nDestruction of Study Drug \nLocal or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used \ninvestigational product for safety reasons. In these cases, it may be acceptable for \ninvestigational site staff to destroy dispensed investigational product before a monitoring \ninspection provided that source document verification is performed on the remaining \ninventory and reconciled against the documentation of quantity shipped, dispensed, \nreturned and destroyed. Written authorization must be obtained from the sponsor or \ndesignee at study start up before destruction. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 37 \nWritten documentation of destruction must contain the following: \n\u2013 Identity [batch numbers or subject numbers] of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 Quantity of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 Date of destruction \n\u2013 Method of destruction \n\u2013 Name and signature of responsible person [or company] who destroyed \ninvestigational products[s] \n7. \nSAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE \n7.1 \nAdverse Events (AEs) and Laboratory Abnormalities \n7.1.1 \nClinical AEs \nPer the International Conference of Harmonization [ICH], an AE is any untoward \nmedical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a \npharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with \nthis treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign [including \nan abnormal laboratory finding], symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use \nof a medicinal [investigational] product, whether or not considered related to the \nmedicinal [investigational] product. Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study \nare to be reported as AEs. Influenza signs and symptoms reported on the diary card will \nbe summarized as efficacy end points and need not be captured as adverse events. \nHowever, secondary illnesses due to influenza must be reported as adverse events.  \n7.1.1.1 \nIntensity  \nAll clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of \nthe CRF.   \nIntensity of AEs will be graded on a four -point scale [mild, moderate, severe, \nlife-threatening] and reported in detail on the CRF.   \nMild \ndiscomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. \nModerate \ndiscomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity. \nSevere \ninability to work or perform normal daily activity \nLife Threatening \nrepresents an immediate threat to life   \n7.1.1.2 \nDrug - Adverse event relationship \nRelationship of the AE to the treatment should always be assessed by the investigator. \nDescription of scales can be found in Appendix 4. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 38 \n7.1.1.3 \nSerious Adverse Events [Immediately Reportable to Roche] \nA Serious Adverse Event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect or precaution. It is any AE that at any dose fulfils at least one \nof the following criteria: \n\u2013 is fatal; [results in death; NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event]  \n\u2013 is Life-Threatening [NOTE: the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to \nan event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe]. \n\u2013 required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \nThe full requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to. \n(Appendix 5) \n7.1.2 \nTreatment and Follow-up of AEs  \nAEs, especially those for which the relationship to test \u201cdrug\u201d is not \u201cunrelated\u201d, should \nbe followed up until they have returned to baseline status or stabilized. If a clear \nexplanation is established it should be recorded on the CRF.   \n7.1.3 \nLaboratory Test Abnormalities \nLaboratory test results will appear printed on laboratory reports provided to the site from \nthe central lab.  \nAny laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event [SAE] \nshould be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the CRF. \nAny treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result which is clinically significant, i.e., \nmeeting one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded as a single diagnosis \non the AE page in the CRF: \n\u2022 Accompanied by clinical symptoms \n\u2022 Leading to a change in study medication [e.g. dose modification, interruption or \npermanent discontinuation] \n\u2022 Requiring a change in concomitant therapy [e.g. addition of, interruption of, \ndiscontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or \ntreatment]. \n7.1.4 \nFollow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values \nIn the event of medically significant unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the \ntests should be repeated and followed up until they have returned to the normal range \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 39 \nand/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. If a clear explanation is \nestablished it should be recorded on the CRF.  \n7.2 \nHandling of Safety Parameters \n7.2.1 \nReporting of Serious Adverse Events [immediately reportable] \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious and which occurs during \nthe course of the study [as defined in section 7.1.1.3 above], regardless of the treatment \narm, must be reported to Roche or designee within one working day of the investigator \nbecoming aware of the event [expedited reporting]. \nRelated Serious Adverse Events MUST be collected and reported regardless of the time \nelapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  \nUnrelated Serious Adverse Events must be collected and reported during the study and up \nuntil the follow-up visit.  \nThe definition and reporting requirements of ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data \nManagement, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be \nadhered to. (Appendix 5) \n7.2.2 \nPregnancy  \nA female subject must be instructed to stop taking the test \u201cdrug\u201d and immediately \ninform the investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study. The investigator should \nreport all pregnancies within 24 hours to the sponsor or designee. The investigator should \ncounsel the subject, and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the \npossible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion \nof the pregnancy.   \nPregnancy occurring in the partner of a male subject participating in the study should be \nreported to the investigator and the sponsor or designee after the pregnant partner\u2019s \nconsent has been obtained. The partner should be counseled and followed as described \nabove if acceptable, and provides informed consent.  \n7.3 \nWarnings and Precautions  \nEvents such as convulsions and those associated with delirium have been reported during \noseltamivir use in patients with influenza.  In rare cases, the delirium resulted in \naccidental injury.  The contribution of oseltamivir to those events is unknown.  Such \nevents have also been reported in patients with influenza who were not taking \noseltamivir. Patients, especially children and adolescents, should be closely monitored.   \nPlease refer to the attached Investigator\u2019s Brochure for additional warnings, precautions, \nand other reported adverse events. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 40 \n8. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN   \nFull details of all planned analyses will be specified in a separate Data Reporting and \nAnalysis Manual (DRAM). The methods described below are an outline of the main \nplanned analyses. \n8.1 \nPrimary and Secondary Study Endpoints \n8.1.1 \nPrimary Endpoints \nThe primary endpoint in this study is the time to alleviation of all clinical influenza \nsymptoms (recorded in the diary card). \n8.1.2 \nSecondary Endpoints \nThe following are secondary endpoints. With the exceptions of viral load and time to \nresolution of fever, they are defined as either the occurrence or non-occurrence of the \nspecified events or the presence or absence of the specified symptoms,  \nShedding virus by culture at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15 and 40 \nShedding virus by RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 \nViral load by culture (log10TCID50/mL) at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40  \nViral load by quantitative RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15 and 40 \nThe time (hours) from first dose of study medication until resolution of fever  \n Fever  \nCough   \nCoryza   \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or \nsinusitis) at any time during the study. \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or \nsinusitis) at any time during the study that are treated with antibiotics \nInitiation of treatment with antibiotics after randomization  \nHospitalization, and for those who are hospitalized, the duration of hospitalization \nDevelopment of rejection or GVHD \nBaseline, post-baseline and change from baseline in antibody titers \n8.1.3 \nSafety \nSafety of the treatment will be evaluated by AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs.  \nAll subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and had a safety assessment \nperformed post randomization will be included in the safety evaluation. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 41 \nIn addition to routine safety assessments, the proportion of subjects experiencing a \nrejection and/or graft versus host disease will be summarized by treatment group.  \n8.2 \nStatistical and Analytical Methods  \n8.2.1 \nStatistical Model  \n8.2.1.1 \nPrimary Variables \nA non-parametric model will be assumed with estimation of medians based on Kaplan-\nMeier methods. Subjects without alleviation of symptoms will have their time censored at \nthe last available observation that a complete assessment was made. \nFor the purpose of comparing treatment groups, it will be assumed that their respective \ndistributions for the primary endpoint differ only by a shift in location. \n8.2.1.2 \nSecondary Variables  \nFor the secondary endpoints defined dichotomously in terms of events or symptoms, it \nwill be assumed that the number of patients experiencing the event or exhibiting the \nsymptom will have a binomial distribution. \nFor the continuous endpoint of time to resolution of fever, the same assumptions as for \nthe primary endpoint will be made. \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 no model will \nbe assumed.  \n8.2.2 \nSample Size \nSample size calculations were performed using a two-sided t-test and are based on the \ncomparison with a placebo control response in the pivotal registration trials in healthy \nadults of 112 hours for median time to alleviation of all symptoms. Assuming an \nexpected median time to alleviation of symptoms of 78 hours for each of the two active \ntreatment groups in this study, and a common standard deviation of 98 hours, then 111 \nevaluable subjects per group would give more than 90% power to detect a difference \nbetween the control and each of the active treatment groups. It is assumed that as many as \n90 % of subjects enrolled into the study will have influenza, and therefore 124 subjects \nper arm would be required in order to obtain 111 influenza positive subjects. Note that \nthis is an approximate calculation, as the final analysis will be based on the difference in \nmedians and the corresponding 95% confidence interval from the Kaplan-Meier curves. \nThis is however considered as a sufficient indication for the size of the trial and the \npower that is expected.  \n8.2.3 \nHypothesis Testing  \nFormal hypothesis testing will be not performed, instead inferences will be based on \ncomparison of confidence intervals.  \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 42 \n8.2.4 \nAnalysis Populations \nThree main patient populations will be used for the analysis of data from this study; the \nSafety Population, the Intent-to treat Population and the Intent-to-Treat Infected \nPopulation . Detailed definitions of these populations will be given in the DRAM  \n8.2.4.1 \nIntent to treat population: \nAll patients randomized will be included in the intent to treat population [Patients will be \nassigned to treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes] \n8.2.4.2 \nIntent to treat infected population: \nAll patients randomized and with laboratory confirmation of influenza infection (positive \nviral cultures or 4 fold or greater rise in antibody titers) will be included in the intent to \ntreat influenza infected population [Patients will be assigned to treatment groups as \nrandomized for analysis purposes] \nThe ITTI Population will be the primary population for the summary and analysis of the \nprimary and secondary efficacy variables. \n8.2.4.3 \nSubpopulations \nIn order to evaluate the potential for relapse, the following two subpopulations of the \nITTI population will be evaluated:  \n\u2022 patients not shedding virus as assessed by culture on Day 11 \n\u2022 patients not shedding virus as assessed by RT-PCR on Day 11 \nViral shedding and RT-PCR at days 15 and 40 will be evaluated in these subpopulations. \nBased on the proportion of subjects hospitalized, an additional subpopulation may be \ndefined to evaluate the length of hospitalization for hospitalized subjects. \nLikewise, based on the proportion of children enrolled additional subpopulations of \nchildren and adults will be created to evaluate the course of influenza in children and \nadults.  \n8.2.5 \nEfficacy Analysis \nFor the primary analysis, the following two assessments will be made independently of \neach other and without regard to the outcomes in each case. \n\u2022 Comparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials  \n  \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment \napproval, a population of placebo treated patients will be established to match (in \nterms of efficacy evaluations, duration of observation etc.) those of the current study. \nFor this population, a median time to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms \nwill be determined along with its 95% confidence interval. \n \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 43 \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.  These confidence intervals \nwill be compared individually to the placebo control confidence interval described \nabove as a potential means of establishing treatment effects. \n\u2022  Assessment of relative efficacy. \n \nThe two doses groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in \nthe median times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% \nconfidence interval. The methodology will be based on the use of the Hodges-\nLehmann estimator in the case of censored data.  \nThis confidence interval will provide lower and upper limits for the treatment difference \nand can be used as the basis for potential inferences. For example, if it does not contain \nthe value zero a difference will have been established. However, given the study sample \nsize this outcome is only likely if a clinically significant difference (e.g. 30% ) exists. \nAlthough this is not anticipated from the experience in pivotal registration trials in \nnormal healthy patients, it cannot be ruled out as a possibility in immunocompromised \ntransplant recipients.   \nFor the dichotomous secondary endpoints, the proportion experiencing the event or \nsymptom, and its associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment \ngroup. Where possible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control \npopulation will be presented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment \ngroups in this trial. \nThe continuous secondary endpoints time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for \nthe primary endpoint.  \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load (log10TCID50/mL) at Day 1, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40, \nsummary statistics (including mean, median, minimum and maximum) will be derived \nfor each treatment group. \n8.2.5.1 \nExclusion of Data from Analysis \nNo data will be excluded from the primary and secondary efficacy analyses.  \n8.2.5.2 \nInterim Analysis \nNo interim analyses are planned.  \n8.2.6 \nSafety Data Analysis \nThe safety analysis population will include all subjects who receive at least one dose and \nhad a safety assessment performed post randomization. All safety parameters will be \nsummarized and presented in tables based on this safety population.  \n8.2.7 \nOther Analyses \nThe number and percentage of patients with influenza infection (defined as a positive \nculture from a nasal and/or throat swab or 4 fold or greater rise in antibody titers) will be \nsummarized by treatment group for the Intent-to-treat Population. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 44 \nFurther exploratory analysis, (including assessments of the rapid diagnostic test, sub \ngroup analysis) will be detailed in the DRAM. \nThe last positive viral isolate from each patient will be tested for reduced sensitivity to \noseltamivir. Clonal resistance assays will also be used to evaluate the rate of resistance to \noseltamivir. These data will be summarized in a report separate from the final study \nreport. \n8.3 \nPharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analysis \n8.3.1 \nPharmacokinetic Analysis   \nNonlinear mixed effects modeling (with software NONMEM) will be used to analyze all \nplasma concentration-time data of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate following \noseltamivir \nadministration. \nPopulation \npharmacokinetic \nparameters \n(clearance, \ndistribution volume) will be estimated. The influence of covariates (such as age, gender, \nbody weight and calculated creatinine) on these parameters will be investigated. Based on \nthe population PK model individual pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, Cmax, Cmin \nand tmax may be calculated using Bayesian posthocs. If deemed appropriate and necessary, \ndata may be pooled with data from previous studies investigating oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate in order to improve model stability.  \n8.3.2 \nPharmacodynamic Analysis  \nIf feasible, the relationship between PK exposure of oseltamivir carboxylate and viral \nshedding response data will be characterized using nonlinear mixed effects modeling \n(using software NONMEM). Relevant population PD parameters will be derived and the \ninfluence of covariates will be investigated. If deemed appropriate and necessary, data \nmay be pooled with data from previous studies investigating oseltamivir and oseltamivir \ncarboxylate in order to improve the model stability. \n9. \nDATA QUALITY ASSURANCE \nThe overall procedures for quality assurance of clinical study data are described in the \nRoche Standard Operational Procedures. \nAccurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross\u2013check of \nthe CRFs against the investigator\u2019s records by the study monitor [source document \nverification], and the maintenance of a drug\u2013dispensing log by the investigator.  \nThe data collected will be entered into the study database from the working copy of the \nCRF faxed from the site. \nA comprehensive validation check program will verify the data and discrepancy reports \nwill be generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator. As patients complete the \nstudy [or prematurely withdraw] and their signed CRFs become available, a second data \nentry will be performed from the original, signed CRF. A comparison check will be run \nto identify and resolve any discrepancies between the first and second data entry. \nThroughout the study the Study Management Team [SMT] will review data according to \nthe SMT Data Review Plan as described in the Data Quality Plan.  \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 45 \n9.1 \nAssignment of Preferred Terms and Original Terminology \nFor classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by the sponsor to the original \nterms entered on the CRF, using the current version of MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for \nRegulatory Activities terminology) for adverse events and diseases and the INN \n(International Non-Proprietary name) drug terms and procedures dictionary for \ntreatments and surgical and medical procedures. \n \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 46 \n10. \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in \u201cGuideline for Good \nClinical Practice\u201d ICH Tripartite Guideline [January 1997] or with local law if it affords \ngreater protection to the subject. For studies conducted in the EU/EEA countries, the \ninvestigator will ensure compliance with the EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC].  \nFor studies conducted in the USA or under US IND, the investigator will additionally \nensure that the basic principles of \u201cGood Clinical Practice\u201d as outlined in the current \nversion of 21 CFR, subchapter D, part 312, \u201cResponsibilities of Sponsors and \nInvestigators\u201d, part 50, \u201cProtection of Human Subjects\u201d, and part 56, \u201cInstitutional \nReview Boards\u201d, are adhered to. \nIn other countries where \u201cGuideline for Good Clinical Practice\u201d exist Roche and the \ninvestigators will strictly ensure adherence to the stated provisions. \n11.2 \nInformed Consent  \n It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator [if \nacceptable by local regulations], to obtain written informed consent from each subject \nparticipating in this study, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated \nbenefits, and potential hazards of the study. For subjects not qualified or incapable of \ngiving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legally acceptable \nrepresentative. In the case where both the subject and his/her legally acceptable \nrepresentative are unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire \ninformed consent discussion. After the subject and representative have orally consented \nto participation in the trial, the witness\u2019 signature on the form will attest that the \ninformation in the consent form was accurately explained and understood. The \ninvestigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are completely free to refuse \nto enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason. The Case Report \nForms [CRFs] for this study contain a section for documenting informed subject consent, \nand this must be completed appropriately. If new safety information results in significant \nchanges in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated \nif necessary. All subjects [including those already being treated] should be informed of \nthe new information, given a copy of the revised form and give their consent to continue \nin the study. \nIf children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the study, they should \nalso be informed and should also provide their written consent. \n \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 49 \n11.3 \nIndependent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Board  \nIndependent Ethics Committees [non-US]: This protocol and any accompanying \nmaterial provided to the subject [such as subject information sheets or descriptions of the \nstudy used to obtain informed consent] as well as any advertising or compensation given \nto the patient, will be submitted by the investigator to an Independent Ethics Committee. \nApproval from the committee must be obtained before starting the study, and should be \ndocumented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the committee met \nand granted the approval. \nAny modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the Independent Ethics \nCommittee approval must also be submitted by the investigator to the Committee in \naccordance with local procedures and regulatory requirements. \nWhen no local review board exists, the investigator is expected to submit the protocol to \na regional committee. If no regional committee exists, Roche will assist the investigator \nin submitting the protocol to the European Ethics Review Committee. \nInstitutional Review Board [US]: It is the understanding of the sponsor that this \nprotocol [and any modifications] as well as appropriate consent procedures, will be \nreviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board. This board must operate in \naccordance with the current Federal Regulations. A letter or certificate of approval will \nbe sent by the investigator to the  sponsor or designee prior to initiation of the study, and \nalso whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made. \n12. \nCONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL \nProtocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between \nan appropriate representative of the sponsor and the investigator [investigator \nrepresentative[s] in the case of a multicenter trial].  Protocol modifications must be \nprepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially reviewed and approved by the \nClinical Science Leader/Clinical Pharmacologist and Biostatistician. \nAll protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Independent Ethics \nCommittee or Institutional Review Board for information and approval in accordance with \nlocal requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required. Approval must be awaited \nbefore any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an \nimmediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the change[s] involves only logistical or \nadministrative aspects of the trial [e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone \nnumber[s]. \n13. \nCONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY \nBoth the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  \nShould this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual study \nbasis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, Roche and the investigator \nwill assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient\u2019s interests. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 50 \n14. \nSTUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS AND RECORD KEEPING \n14.1 \nInvestigator's Files / Retention of Documents \nThe Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of \nthe study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These \ndocuments should be classified into two different separate categories [1] Investigator's \nStudy File, and [2] subject clinical source documents. \nThe Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, Case Report and \nQuery Forms, Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and \ngovernmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, \nstaff \ncurriculum \nvitae \nand \nauthorization \nforms \nand \nother \nappropriate \ndocuments/correspondence etc.  \nSubject clinical source documents [usually defined by the project in advance to record \nkey efficacy/safety parameters independent of the CRFs] would include patient \nhospital/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original \nlaboratory reports, ECG, EEG, X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed \ninformed consent forms, consultant letters, and subject screening and enrollment logs. \nThe Investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least 15 years \nafter completion or discontinuation of the study. After that period of time the documents \nmay be destroyed, subject to local regulations.  \nShould the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to \nanother location, Roche must be notified in advance. \nIf the Investigator can not guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site \nfor any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the \nInvestigator and Roche to store these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that \nthey can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source \ndocuments are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies should be \nmade for storing outside of the site. \n14.2 \nSource Documents and Background Data \nThe investigator shall supply the sponsor or designee on request with any required \nbackground data from the study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly \nimportant when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are suspected. In \ncase of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, it \nis also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that patient \nconfidentiality is protected. \n14.3 \nAudits and Inspections \nThe investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made \navailable to appropriately qualified personnel from the Roche Pharma Development   \nQuality Assurance Unit or its designees, or to health authority inspectors after appropriate \nnotification. The verification of the CRF data must be by direct inspection of source \ndocuments. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 51 \n14.4 \nCase Report Forms \nFor each patient enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal \ninvestigator or authorized delegate from the study staff. This also applies to records for \nthose patients who fail to complete the study [even during a pre-randomization screening \nperiod if a CRF was initiated]. If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be \nnoted on the CRF. If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment-\nlimiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. \nAll forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink, and must be legible. Errors \nshould be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed \nand dated by the investigator or his/her authorized delegate. The investigator should \nensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported to the  \nsponsor or designee in the CRFs and in all required reports. \n15. \nMONITORING THE STUDY \nIt is understood that the responsible Roche monitor [or designee] will contact and visit \nthe investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the various records \nof the trial [CRFs and other pertinent data] provided that patient confidentiality is \nmaintained in accord with local requirements. \nIt will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout \nthe study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and \naccuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to laboratory \ntest reports and other patient records needed to verify the entries on the CRF. The \ninvestigator [or his/her deputy] agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any \nproblems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. \n16. \nCONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT \nRECORDS \nThe investigator must assure that subjects\u2019 anonymity will be maintained and that their \nidentities are protected from unauthorized parties. On CRFs or other documents \nsubmitted to the  sponsor or designee, subjects should not be identified by their names, \nbut by an identification code. The investigator should keep a subject enrollment log \nshowing codes, names and addresses. The investigator should maintain documents not for \nsubmission to Roche, e.g., subjects\u2019 written consent forms, in strict confidence. \n17. \nPUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS \nThe results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is \nforeseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Roche prior to \nsubmission. This allows the  sponsor or designee to protect proprietary information and to \nprovide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available \nto the investigator. \nIn accord with standard editorial and ethical practice, Roche will generally support \npublication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data. In \nthis case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 52 \nAny formal publication of the study in which input of Roche personnel exceeded that of \nconventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and \nthe appropriate Roche personnel. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement. \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 53 \n \nAppendix 1 \nCalculation of Creatinine Clearance and Grading of Chronic \nExtensive GVHD  \n \nCalculation of Creatinine Clearance \nConversion Factor for Serum Creatinine: \nConventional Units (mg/dL) = SI Units (\u00b5mol/L) \u00f7 88.4   \nAge = number of years (12 years 11 months = 12 years) \n \nEstimated Creatinine Clearance according to Cockcroft-Gault [17] \n (for patients \u2265 18 years): \n\ufffd Males \nCreatinine  \nClearance (mL/min) = \n \n[(140 \u2013 age) X Body Weight (kg)] \u00f7 [72 X Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)] \n \n\ufffd Females  \nCreatinine Clearance = above equation X 0.85 \n \n \n \nEstimated Creatinine Clearance according to Schwartz equation [18]  \n(for patients < 18 years): \nCreatinine Clearance \n(mL/min/1.73 M2) = \n \nk X Height (cms) \u00f7  Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) \n \nValue for k:  \nk \nAge (years) \n0.45 \n< 2 \n0.55 \n\u2265 2 to < 13 \n0.7 \n\u2265 13 to < 18 (males) \n \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 54 \n \nAppendix 1 \nCalculation of Creatinine Clearance and Grading of Chronic \nExtensive GVHD (Cont.) \n \nGrading of Chronic GVHD [19] \n \nType of Disease \nExtent of Disease \nLimited \nLocalized \nskin \ninvolvement, \nliver \ndysfunction or both \nExtensive \nGeneralized skin involvement \n \nLocalized \nskin \ninvolvement \nor \nliver \ndysfunction plus any one of the following: \n   1.

An AE may be considered probable, if: \n1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n2. It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject\u2019s \nclinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered \nto the subject. \n3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  [There are important \nexceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet \ndrug-relatedness clearly exists; e.g., [1] bone marrow depression, [2] tardive \ndyskinesias.] \n4. It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n5. It reappears upon rechallenge. \n \nPOSSIBLE [must have first two] \n1. This category applies to those AEs in which the connection with the test drug \nadministration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be \nconsidered possible if, or when: \n2. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n3. It may have been produced by the subject\u2019s clinical state, environmental or toxic \nfactors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. \n4. It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n \nREMOTE [must have first two] \n1. In general, this category is applicable to an AE which meets the following criteria: \n2. It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n3. It may readily have been produced by the subject\u2019s clinical state, environmental or \ntoxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. \n4. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n5. It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered. \n \nUNRELATED \nThis category is applicable to those AEs which are judged to be clearly and \nincontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes [disease, environment, etc.] and do not meet \nthe criteria for drug relationship listed under remote, possible, or probable. \n \n \n \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 58 \n \nAppendix 4 \nAdverse Event [AEs] Categories for Determining \nRelationship to Test Drug (Cont.) \n \n \n \nProbable \nPossible \nRemote \nUnrelated \nClearly due to extraneous causes \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n \n \n \n \n \nReasonable temporal association with drug \nadministration \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n \n \n \nMay be produced by subject clinical state, \netc. \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n \n \n \n \n \nKnown response pattern to suspected drug \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n \n \n \nDisappears or decreases on cessation or \nreduction in dose \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n \n \n \nReappears on rechallenge \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nRoche Protocol NV20234  (RO640796)  - Page 59 \n \nAppendix 5 \nICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 \n \nA serious adverse event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect or precaution.  It is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 is fatal; [results in death] [NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event] \n\u2013 is Life-Threatening    [NOTE: the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to \nan event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe]. \n\u2013 required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above \nMedical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited \nreporting to the  sponsor or designee is appropriate in other situations, such as important \nmedical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or \nhospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one \nof the outcomes listed in the definitions above. These situations should also usually be \nconsidered serious. \nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for \nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; \nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \nAn unexpected AE is one, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the \napplicable product information. \nCausality is initially assessed by the investigator. For Serious Adverse Events, possible \ncauses of the event is indicated by selecting one or more options.  (Check all that apply)  \n\u2013 Pre-existing/Underlying disease - specify  \n\u2013 Study treatment \u2013 specify the drug(s) related to the event \n\u2013 Other treatment (concomitant or previous) \u2013 specify \n\u2013 Protocol-related procedure \n\u2013 Other (e.g. accident, new or intercurrent illness) - specify \nThe term severe is a measure of intensity, thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious.

Routine influenza surveillance during the 2007/2008 influenza season showed a significant increase in the global circulation of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus (A H1N1 with H274Y mutation).  Therefore, baseline nasal and throat swab samples will be assessed for the presence of the H274Y-mutated influenza virus and results will be reported to clinical sites to assist in determining the most appropriate treatment options for individual patients.

Old text: This study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo controlled trials. At the outset, a patient population that represents the general immunocompromised population had to be defined. As a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this population, an alternative control arm had to be identified. The response to placebo in pivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was chosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial. In order to do this, the current study design and end points were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal registration trials.

Baseline samples will be assessed for the presence of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 with the H274Y resistance mutation using a real-time PCR assay.  A phenotypic assay will be performed to determine the susceptibility of the last positive viral isolate from each patient. If required, a genotypic assay to determine the contribution of both the neuraminidase and haemagglutinin genes to decreased susceptibility will be performed.  During the course of treatment, neither the investigator nor the patient will know which participants have ongoing positive viral cultures for influenza. However, in order to assist in patient management, the results of the assay to detect influenza A H1N1 H274Y at baseline will be reported to the sites as soon as they are available.

During the dosing period, diary card symptoms should be assessed and \ntemperature should be recorded at the same time that the study drug is taken. \nEnd of Follow-Up Day 40 \nPatients or parents/guardians who do not return to the clinic will be contacted by \ntelephone to ascertain their health status, or that of their child\u2019s, record information on \nadverse events, and to ask that they return the symptom diary card. \nSection 5.3.1  Efficacy Assessments \nNew text: \nThe primary end point in this study is the time to resolution of all influenza symptoms as \nrecorded in the patient diary.  \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \n1. Symptoms of influenza-like illness. These are captured in the diary for both adults \nand children. (Apendix 2) (Appendix 3). Influenza symptoms are graded on a nominal \nscale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem). A score of zero \nis considered asymptomatic. The primary end point, time to alleviation of all \nsymptoms is comprised of all the symptoms captured in the diary.  \n2. Temperature. This is captured in the diary. Temperature is used for assessment of the \nprimary and several secondary end points. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 15 \nOld text: \nThe primary end point in this study is the time to resolution of all influenza symptoms as \nrecorded in the diary cards.  \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \n1.

Hoffmann-La Roche LTD  \nCLINICAL \nPHASE  \nIIIb \nINDICATION \nTreatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients \nOBJECTIVES  \nPrimary: \nTo evaluate prospectively the efficacy of oseltamivir for the \ntreatment of influenza in transplant recipients as measured by the \ntime to resolution of influenza symptoms \n \nSecondary: \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and high dose oseltamivir \nin transplant recipients on: \n\u2022 \nThe clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary \nillnesses as evidenced by otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, \nor sinusitis)  \n\u2022 \nThe virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and \nviral loads at different time points) \n\u2022 \nPatient safety and tolerability  \n\u2022 \nThe development of  resistant influenza virus \n \nTRIAL DESIGN \nThis is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center trial of twice \ndaily, conventional and high dose oseltamivir for the treatment of \ninfluenza in immunocompromised patients (as represented by \ntransplant recipients).  Subjects will be stratified by age, transplant \ntype, time since onset of flu symptoms and treatment start (\u2264 24 or \n>24 hours) and vaccination status \nNUMBER OF SUBJECTS \nA minimum of 250 (125 per arm) \nNUMBER OF CENTERS \nApproximately 140 centers in the Northern hemisphere \nTARGET POPULATION \nTransplant recipients (liver, kidney, liver and kidney, allogenic \nhaematopoietic stem cell transplant), 1 year of age and older \nenrolled during the influenza season.  The subjects will be positive \nfor influenza by a rapid diagnostic test at baseline. \nLENGTH OF STUDY  \n10 days of treatment, 30 days of follow up.   \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL \nPRODUCT(S) \nDOSE/ ROUTE/ REGIMEN \nOseltamivir/placebo dry powder (to be reconstituted to a \nconcentration of 12 mg/ml) and 75 mg capsules.  The duration of \ndosing in both adults and children is 10 days. \n \nConventional dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup \n\u2264 15 kg   \n \n30 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg  \n \n45 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg  \n \n75 mg twice daily  \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265  13 years): Oseltamivir capsules  75 \nmg twice daily \n \nSubjects randomized to the conventional dose will simultaneously \nreceive matching placebo so as to blind them and the investigator \nfrom the high dose arm.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 2 \n \n \nHigh dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup  \n\u2264 15 kg   \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg  \n \n90 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg \n \n120 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg  \n \n150 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years):  Oseltamivir capsules  \n150 mg twice daily  \n \nDose adjustments:  In both treatment arms, dosing frequency will \nbe decreased to once daily in patients with severe renal impairment \n(Cr Cl in adults between 10-30 ml/min and children between 10-30 \nml/min/1.73M2.). \nCOMPARATOR \u201cDRUG\u201d (or STANDARD OF \nCARE) DOSE/ ROUTE/ REGIMEN \nPlacebo (from pivotal registration trials in otherwise healthy adults) \nASSESSMENTS OF: \n \n- \nEFFICACY \nTime to resolution of all influenza symptoms as recorded in the \npatient diary. \n- \nSAFETY \nAdverse events, physical exams, vital signs and clinical laboratory \nevaluations \n \nPROCEDURES (summary): \nThe key procedures are: \nBlood draws for serum chemistry, hematology, and serology. \nNasal and throat swabs for viral culture and RT-PCR. \n \nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES: \nSample size calculations were performed using a two-sided t-test and are based on the comparison with a \nplacebo control response in the pivotal registration trials in healthy adults of 112 hours for median time to \nalleviation of all symptoms. Assuming an expected median time to alleviation of symptoms of 78 hours for \neach of the two active treatment groups in this study, and a common standard deviation of 98 hours, then \n111 evaluable subjects per group would give more than 90% power to detect a difference between the \ncontrol and each of the active treatment groups. \n \nThe primary endpoint will be time to alleviation of all clinical influenza symptoms, as recorded in the diary \ncards. \n \nFor the primary analysis, the following two assessments will be made independently of each other and \nwithout regard to the outcomes in each case. \n\u2022 \nComparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials \n \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment approval, a population \nof placebo treated patients will be established to match those of the current study. For this population, \na median time to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms will be determined along with its 95% \nconfidence interval. \n \n\u2022 \nAssessment of relative efficacy \n \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in the median times \nto alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% confidence interval. The methodology will \nbe based on the use of the Hodges-Lehmann estimator in the case of censored data. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 3 \nTable of Contents\n1.

Influenza virus types A and B cause \nan acute febrile infection of the respiratory tract characterized by the sudden onset of \nfever, malaise, headaches, myalgias and cough. Influenza causes numerous deaths each \nyear [1]. Although difficult to assess, annual influenza epidemics are thought to result in \nbetween three and five million cases of severe illness, and between 250,000 and 500,000 \ndeaths every year around the world. [2] \nThe influenza viruses are segmented, negative sense, single stranded, lipid encapsulated, \nRNA viruses between 80 and 100 nm in size. Subtypes are defined according to \nglycoproteins present in the viral lipid coat. The haemagglutinin complex (HA) is the \nmajor surface protein of the virus. The neuraminidase (NA) protein is the second major \nsurface protein in the virion and plays a role in enhancing virus penetration of the mucus \nlayer around the target cell and in release of virus from the cell surface. The matrix \nproteins, M1 and M2 appear to trigger the disintegration of the M1 complex during virus \nfusion with the cell and may also be involved in the maturation of the HA prior to \nassembly of new virus particles.  \n1.1.1 \nInfluenza \nInfluenza infection is usually a self limiting condition. However, in children, the elderly \nand the immunocompromised, influenza infection can be associated with substantial \nmorbidity and mortality [1].  In patients with compromised immunity, influenza virus \nmay cause severe lower respiratory tract involvement; unusual syndromes, including \nencephalitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis and death. [3]  The availability of new \nimmunosuppressive agents has enhanced the number and survival of solid organ \ntransplant (SOT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) [4] recipients making \nthem representative of the larger immunocompromised patient population.   \nIn transplant recipients influenza is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary \ncomplications, extrapulmonary manifestations and an increased risk of graft dysfunction \nand high attributable mortality. In a cohort study of influenza viral infection in SOT \nsubjects, 30 cases of influenza viral infection were identified. Secondary bacterial \npneumonia was seen in 17 % of subjects and three SOT recipients (2 liver and one \nkidney) had myositis, myocarditis and bronchiolitis obliterans. Biopsy of the transplanted \norgan was performed in 21 of 30 cases and revealed variable degrees of acute allograft \nrejection in 62 % of subjects. The study concluded that influenza was associated with \nsignificant morbidity in different groups of SOT recipients [5]  \nAmong transplant recipients, subjects with HSCT are at the greatest risk for morbidity. In \na prospective study from the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the European Group \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 11 \nfor Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 1973 patients were evaluated for respiratory virus \ninfections after stem cell transplant.  The overall mortality was 23% from influenza A \ninfection and the direct influenza A-associated mortality was 15.3% in this study. [6] \nThe largest study of influenza infections in transplant (allogenic, syngenic or autologous \nHSCT) subjects comes from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, USA. In this \nretrospective study, influenza virus was isolated in 62 of 4797 subjects undergoing HSCT \nover a 13-year period. During this period, the Center had a standardized protocol for the \ndetection of respiratory pathogens comprising direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining \nand viral culture. Because capture of influenza infections and accurate ascertainment of \nall risk factors was less complete after discharge from the health care center, only \ninfections that occurred during the first 120 days after transplantation were considered. \nInfluenza was defined as the isolation of influenza virus by culture or as evidence of \ninfluenza antigen detected by DFA in conjunction with consistent symptomatology.  \nAntiviral treatment with an M2 inhibitor or oseltamivir (available since 1999) was \nperformed at the discretion of the investigator. Unlike the fixed dosing duration \nrecommended for antivirals in healthy subjects, in this trial, treatment was continued until \nresolution of presenting signs and symptoms and clearance of virus from respiratory \nsecretions. Garrett Nichols, et al, reported as many as 29 % of subjects developed \npneumonia following influenza infection in this large retrospective study. Ten percent of \nthe subjects with influenza died [7].  \nThe increased morbidity in transplant patients is associated with increased duration of \nvirus shedding compared to that in healthy subjects. In otherwise healthy adults, elderly \nsubjects and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated subjects was 70, \n96 and 118 hours respectively. [8] In contrast, in the retrospective HSCT study, influenza \nvirus was shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a median \nduration of 168 hours (7 days, range 2 to 37 days) [7]. This median duration of shedding \nincluded both allogenic and autologous HSCT subjects and both treated and untreated \nsubjects. The mean duration of shedding in treated and untreated allogenic HSCT \nsubjects was found to be longer than in autologous HSCT subjects (11.1 versus 6.7 days).  \nJohny et al, evaluated the use of zanamivir in the treatment of influenza in seven \nallogenic bone marrow transplant subjects. As with the large retrospective HSCT study, \ntheir standard of care also was to continue zanamivir until symptoms had subsided and it \nwas documented that viral excretion had ceased. Viral shedding was checked every 7 \ndays. Based on this protocol, the median duration of use of zanamivir was 15 days with a \nrange of 5 to 44 days. [9] \nCurrently available treatments for influenza infection are the M2 ion channel inhibitors \n(e.g. amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir, \nzanamivir). Due to the emergence of resistant virus, the Center for Disease Control \n(CDC) has made an interim recommendation that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be \nused for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in the United States. [10] Oseltamivir \nis therefore one of the main drugs available for the evaluation of the treatment of \ninfluenza in the immunocompromised population.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 12 \n1.1.2 \nOseltamivir \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Ro 64-0796) is an ethyl ester prodrug which is rapidly absorbed \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and metabolized in the liver by \nhigh capacity carboxylesterases to form oseltamivir carboxylate (Ro 64-0802), a potent, \nstable and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes. The active \nform, oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted unchanged by the kidney via glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion by the organic anion transport system. The efficacy \nand safety of oseltamivir in influenza treatment and prevention has been established in an \nextensive series of clinical studies in man. \nOseltamivir has been approved for the treatment of influenza in Europe, the United States \nand most other countries around the world. In adults and adolescents, the recommended \ndose is 75 mg twice daily for five days. In children 1 year of age and older recommended \ndoses are 30, 45 or 60 mg bid based on body weight. In all age groups the recommended \ndose is administered bid for 5 days.   \nThe approval of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza is based on several controlled \nclinical trials. In the pooled population from these clinical trials encompassing adults \naged from 13-97 years, many with significant co-morbidity, 1325 subjects were treated \nwith oseltamivir (75 mg bid) and 1056 subjects received placebo. A total of seven \ninfluenza symptoms (both respiratory and constitutional) were captured on the diary card \nfor adults. The time to resolution of all symptoms (on the diary card) decreased by 24 \nhours; from 124.5 hours in the placebo arm to 100.6 hours with oseltamivir 75 mg bid (p \n< 0.0001).  [8] Further, in adults and adolescents with a proven influenza illness, \noseltamivir treatment reduced overall antibiotic use for any reason by 26.7 % and the \nincidence of influenza-related lower respiratory tract complications resulting in antibiotic \ntherapy by 55 %. The study concluded that oseltamivir treatment of influenza reduces \nlower respiratory tract complications, antibiotic use and hospitalizations in healthy and \n\u2018at risk\u2019 subjects [11].   \nLikewise, in the influenza-infected pediatric population (1 to 12 years of age), oseltamivir \ntreatment (n = 217) was compared with placebo (n = 235). There was a reduction  in  the \nmedian duration of illness (defined based on resolution of temperature, cough, coryza and \nreturn to pre-illness health and activity) of 36 hours; from 137 hours with placebo to 101 \nhours in the oseltamivir treatment arm (p=<0.0001).  The Canadian Acute Respiratory \nInfections Scale (CARIFS), validated for use in children, was used to collect symptom \ndata on the pediatric diary card. The CARIFS scale comprised a total of 18 symptoms \nwhich were evaluated twice daily by the parent or guardian.  There was a similar \nreduction in the time to alleviation of all CARIFS symptoms of 36 hours; from 100 hours \nin the placebo group to 63 hours in the oseltamivir group (p < 0.0001) [12].  \nThus in both adults and children, the time to resolution of all symptoms was significantly \nreduced in the oseltamivir treatment arm compared with placebo.   \nOseltamivir was well-tolerated in clinical trials. Approximately 11,000 subjects have \nreceived oseltamivir in the development program. The most common adverse events \nreported by adults, the elderly, and children were nausea and vomiting. Serious adverse \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 13 \nevents (SAEs) were reported with a low and equal frequency by subjects taking active \ndrug and placebo. Full details are given in the Investigator Brochure. [8] \nThere have been no controlled studies of oseltamivir treatment or prophylaxis in \nimmunocompromised subjects. In the study by Garrett Nichols et al, patients who did not \nreceive antiviral therapy shed virus for longer periods (mean duration, 11.3 days) than did \nthose who were treated with M2 inhibitors (mean duration, 9.7 days) or neuraminidase \ninhibitors (mean duration, 7.5 days). Therapy with oseltamivir (but not rimantadine) \nappeared to be associated with shorter duration of shedding after controlling for steroid \ndose (p < 0.08). [7].  The efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza in the \nimmunocompromised population has also been demonstrated in other studies. In another \nsmall trial of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza infection in subjects following \nHSCT, only two patients (5.1 %) developed influenza-related pneumonia. [13] In this \nstudy, all 39 HSCT subjects with influenza were treated with antivirals (oseltamivir or \namantadine).  In as many as 43 % of subjects, the duration of illness was greater than 7 \ndays. This is unlike data from healthy adults, suggesting the possible need to evaluate a \nhigher dose and/or longer duration of treatment with oseltamivir for this population.    \nWhile the efficacy of antiviral agents for influenza has been demonstrated in the \notherwise healthy population, it has not been tested prospectively in the \nimmunocompromised (transplant) population. [4] There is therefore a need to confirm the \nefficacy of antiviral therapy for influenza in prospective controlled trials in this patient \npopulation.  \n1.2 \nRationale for the Study  \nThis study is designed to investigate the optimal therapy for influenza in \nimmunocompromised transplant recipients. \nThe rationale for conducting this study in the immunocompromised population is based \non the following: \n1. Immunocompromised subjects are at the highest risk for morbidity and mortality \nfrom influenza \n2. Immunocompromised subjects are at the greatest risk for contracting influenza \nbecause immunization may be ineffective in this population \n3. There is no drug approved for the treatment of influenza in this population \n2. \nOBJECTIVES  \n2.1 \nPrimary Objective \nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of oseltamivir \nfor the treatment of influenza in transplant recipients as measured by the time to \nresolution of influenza symptoms. \n2.2 \nSecondary Objectives   \nThe secondary objectives of the study are:  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 14 \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and high dose oseltamivir in transplant recipients \non: \n\u2022 The clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis)  \n\u2022 The virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntime points) \n\u2022 Patient safety and tolerability   \n\u2022 The development of  resistant influenza virus \n\u2022 To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir (e.g. clearance, \nvolume of distribution) in transplant recipients  \n   \n3. \nSTUDY DESIGN \n3.1 \nOverview of Study Design and Dosing Regimen   \nThis is a double blind, randomized, stratified, multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy of \nconventional and high dose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in \nimmunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised transplant recipients who develop \nan influenza-like illness with a positive rapid diagnostic test for influenza, will be \nenrolled during the influenza season.  Patients will be stratified by type of transplant \n[SOT or HSCT], by the time between onset of symptoms and treatment start [\u2264 24 hours; \n> 24 hours], influenza vaccination status for current flu season [Yes; No] and by age [\u226412 \nyears; >12 years]. Eligible patients will be consented and randomized to receive \noseltamivir twice daily for 10 days in one of two treatment arms: conventional dose or \nhigh dose (double the conventional dose). The primary end point in the study is the time \nto alleviation of all symptoms.  \nIn this study, immunocompromised subjects will be represented by the transplant \npopulation. This is justified because the availability of new immunosuppressive agents \nhas enhanced the number and survival of SOT and HSCT recipients, making them \nrepresentative of the larger immunocompromised patient population.    \nHeterogeneity in the transplant population could confound the assessment of safety and \nefficacy in this study. Consequently, the SOT population in the protocol excludes \nsubjects with transplants other than liver, kidney or liver and kidney. However, in order \nto still be representative of the transplant community in particular and the \nimmunocompromised community in general, the study specifically includes subjects at \nthe greatest risk for morbidity and mortality from influenza - the HSCT subjects. The \nstudy also excludes subjects with comorbid conditions that might impact the metabolism \nand excretion of the drug. As the prodrug and active drug accumulate in the presence of \nhepatic and severe renal impairment respectively, subjects with hepatic or severe renal \nimpairment are excluded from the study.  Other comorbid conditions that might preclude \nthe assessment of efficacy and safety are also excluded from the study. These are \nreflected in several of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 15 \n3.1.1 \nRationale for Study Design \nThis study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo controlled \ntrials. At the outset, a patient population that represents the general immunocompromised  \npopulation had to be defined. As a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this \npopulation, an alternative control arm had to be identified. The response to placebo in \npivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was \nchosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial. In order to do this, the \ncurrent study design and end points were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal \nregistration trials.  \nRoutine influenza surveillance during the 2007/2008 influenza season showed a \nsignificant increase in the global circulation of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza \nvirus (A H1N1 with H274Y mutation).  Therefore, baseline nasal and throat swab \nsamples will be assessed for the presence of the H274Y-mutated influenza virus and \nresults will be reported to clinical sites to assist in determining the most appropriate \ntreatment options for individual patients. \nThe following sections provide rationale and justification for the specific aspects of the \nstudy design. They also provide information on how the results will be used to make \nrecommendations on dose and duration of treatment. \n3.1.1.1 \nChoice of treatment arms \nThe pivotal registration trials for oseltamivir in healthy adults with influenza had three \ntreatment arms, two active (75 mg and 150 mg) and one placebo. Both treatment arms \nwere found to be significantly better than placebo. No statistical comparisons were made \nbetween the two active treatment arms. Evaluation of the results in the two active \ntreatment arms did not reveal any clinically meaningful difference. Based on these \nstudies, the approved (conventional) dose for the treatment of influenza in adults is 75 \nmg. \nA similar trial design was envisaged for this immunocompromised population. In an \nimmunocompromised population there is a possibility of increased efficacy with a higher \ndose. In the trials in healthy adults, on day 4 (3 days after the start of treatment), the \nproportion of subjects shedding virus suggested a possible dose response relationship \n(36%, 28% and 23% in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg dose arms respectively). In \nhealthy adults, this difference in the rate of viral shedding did not translate to any \ndifference in clinical response in the two active treatment arms even though both active \ntreatment \narms \nwere \nsignificantly \nbetter \nthan \nthe \nplacebo \narm. \nIn \nthe \nimmunocompromised population too it is possible that while there might not be any \ndifference between the two active treatment arms, one or both of these dose arms may be \nbetter than placebo. In this immunocompromised population, there is therefore an even \ngreater need to evaluate the efficacy of a higher dose arm.  \nAs with the trials in healthy adults, the ideal trial design for the current study would be \none that compared efficacy of the conventional and high dose arms with placebo. \nHowever, as reviewed in an earlier section 1.1.1 the morbidity and mortality from \ninfluenza in the immunocompromised population is far greater than that in healthy adults. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 16 \nThus in one study as many as 29 % of subjects with HSCT developed pneumonia \nfollowing influenza infection. [7] In another study in SOT recipients, biopsy of the \ntransplanted organ revealed variable degrees of acute allograft rejection in 62 % of \nsubjects. [5] Given the extent of morbidity, a placebo control appears unethical. This is \nfurther supported by a feasibility survey conducted by the Sponsor which demonstrated  \nthat a majority of transplant sites actually used antivirals (including oseltamivir) to treat \ninfluenza in this population. It was therefore decided to compare the conventional and \nhigher dose arms with the placebo arm from the pivotal registration trials in healthy \nadults with influenza. Although this approach poses limitations, the Sponsor has made \nevery effort to make sure that the results from such an approach are still meaningful. The \nfollowing sections describe how the study design addresses these limitations.  \n3.1.1.2 \nConsistency with previous influenza treatment studies \nIn order to be able to compare the study findings with the response to placebo in healthy \nadults, this study has been intentionally designed to be consistent with previous \nregistration trials for treatment of influenza in healthy adults. Some of the key design \nfeatures consistent with previous studies include: two active treatment arms, subjects with \ninfluenza like symptoms recruited during the flu season, use of a patient diary to capture \nsymptoms, primary clinical end point based on diary assessments, laboratory evaluation \nof virology and serology samples generally similar to previous trials and the primary \nefficacy analysis population is the Intent to treat Infected (ITTI) population. \nDespite the above considerations, there are issues that can preclude the estimation of the \nresponse to placebo in an immunocompromised population comprising adults and \nchildren from that in healthy adults with influenza. To further mitigate this, the choice of \nendpoints and their interpretation is vital.    \n3.1.1.3 \nInterpretation of study results  \nChoice of primary end point and comparators \nThe current study includes both children and adults. This is because of the significant \nunmet need in both these age groups. The primary end point therefore had to be \napplicable to both age groups. In registration trials in adults, the primary end point was \nthe time to resolution of all clinical symptoms (in the diary card). In registration trials in \nchildren, the primary end point was the reduction in the median duration of illness \n(defined based on temperature, cough, coryza and return to pre-illness health and \nactivity). A key secondary end point in children \u2013 time to resolution of all clinical \nsymptoms showed similar results. The primary endpoint in this study is the time to \nresolution (alleviation) of all symptoms. \n The median of the primary end point in the active treatment groups (conventional and \nhigh dose) in this trial will be compared with the median of the time to resolution of \nsymptoms in the placebo group from the pivotal registration trials. The high dose arm \nenables the detection of a possible dose response relationship in this immune \ncompromised population. As a means to evaluate that possibility, an assessment of the \nrelative efficacy of the two dose groups will be made in terms of median time to \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 17 \nalleviation of symptoms. Section 8.2.5 provides details on the statistical considerations \nand their rationale associated with these comparisons. \nEffect of study design on efficacy end points \nThe main limitations of using the response to placebo from previous trials to estimate the \nresponse in this trial are due to the different populations (healthy versus \nimmunocompromised), age groups (adults versus adults and children) and the potential \ndifference in virulence of different strains. The potential difference in virulence of the \npredominant influenza viruses may be a confounder whose contribution can not be \nestimated. However the difference in populations and age groups is likely to result in the \nplacebo response from pivotal registration trials underestimating the time to alleviation in \nthe immunocompromised population. This is because the time to alleviation of symptoms \nis shorter in the healthy population compared to the immunocompromised population. \n[13] The placebo response in the pivotal trials will therefore underestimate the response \nin the current trial. The Sponsor is thus using a very conservative approach in comparing \nthe active treatment arms in this study with the response to placebo in healthy subjects. If \none/both of the treatment arms is statistically better than placebo, it is considered that this \nis a meaningful effect for this population.  If both treatment arms are not different from \nplacebo and this is seen consistently across several end points, it may be hypothesized \nthat the risk from influenza for the immunocompromised population treated with \noseltamivir is comparable to that for a healthy untreated adult with influenza.   \nPossible dosing recommendations based on current study \nHealthy subjects who were given placebo in the previous pivotal oseltamivir treatment \nstudies will be used as the control arm for this study.  When the two active treatment \narms are compared with this placebo control, several outcomes are possible. These \noutcomes will need to be discussed with health authorities.  Some outcomes and possible \ninterpretations of the results are presented below:   \n1. Conventional and high dose are both shown to be better than placebo: Both treatment \narms will be compared.  If no difference then the conventional dose would be the \ndose recommended for treatment in this population.  If a difference is seen between \ntreatment arms, then an evaluation (including benefit/risk assessment) will be made to \nconfirm whether the higher dose should be the recommended dose. \n2. One active treatment arm is superior to placebo while the other is not: In this instance \nthe dose that is shown to be superior will be recommended unless other \nconsiderations such as safety dictate otherwise.  \n3. Both conventional and high dose arms are not different from placebo: If this is seen \nconsistently across several secondary clinical end points, it may be hypothesized that \noseltamivir has reduced the risk in the immunocompromised population to the more \nacceptable level in the untreated healthy adult population. \n4. It is also possible that both conventional and high dose treatment have a more \nprotracted clinical course than the placebo arm. In this situation, it may be difficult to \nmake conclusions about efficacy.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 18 \nIrrespective of the efficacy outcomes, the study will still provide useful information of \nthe safety of oseltamivir in this population.  \nPossible recommendations for duration of treatment based on the current study \nOnce a dose is chosen a determination will need to be made on whether the \nrecommended duration of treatment should be 5 or 10 days or longer. This decision will \nbe based both on the clinical and virologic course of influenza.   \nThe recommended duration of treatment for influenza in healthy adults is five days. In \nthis study, the duration of dosing is ten days because viral shedding is typically longer in \nthe immunocompromised population than in healthy adults. The general standard of care \nfor this population has been to treat for as long as the patient continues to shed virus \n(even after the resolution of symptoms) [7] [9]. The duration of treatment for this \npopulation is therefore individualized based on clinical response and duration of viral \nshedding. It can often be more than 10 days. While it is possible that 10 or more days of \ntreatment may be needed [7] [9], it is also possible that 5 days of treatment may still be \nadequate. Therefore, in this study the clinical and virologic course (proportion shedding \nvirus at day 6 and later) will be evaluated to make recommendations on the duration of \ndosing. No statistical comparisons will be made.     \nStratification \nStratification in this study has no bearing on any comparisons with results from previous \ntrials. However, in order to evaluate a dose response relationship between the two active \ntreatment arms in this trial, stratification remains essential.  \nBecause HSCT recipients are at the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality from \ninfluenza, patients will be stratified by transplant type (SOT versus HSCT). Patients will \nbe stratified by time between onset of symptoms and treatment start (< 24 hours or \u2265 24 \nhours) because previous experience in otherwise healthy adults and children has shown \nthat patients treated early in their illness respond to treatment better than those who are \ntreated later. Patients will also be stratified by age ( \u2264 12 years and > 12 years) because \notherwise healthy children shed virus longer than otherwise healthy adults. It is expected \nthat a similar difference in the duration of viral shedding would exist between \nimmunocompromised children and adults. As vaccinated subjects may respond faster to \ntherapy, the study is also stratified based on influenza vaccination status for the current \nflu season (Yes; No).   \n3.1.2 \nRationale for Dose Selection and Adjustment \nDose Selection \nThe dose of oseltamivir to be used in this study is the conventional, approved dose for \nchildren and adults in the treatment of influenza. There will be a second higher dose for \ncomparison which is two times the conventional dose. This higher dose is used based on \ntheoretical considerations which suggest that the higher dose may be associated with \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 19 \nThe anticipated pro-drug and metabolite exposures from this higher dose are not expected \nto exceed maximum exposures seen previously in the oseltamivir development program. \nThe safety and tolerability of the higher dose regimen has already been demonstrated in \ntreatment studies of immunocompetent adult subjects (n = 447). [14] In a study to \ndemonstrate cardiac safety, in the highest dose group treated with 450 mg b.i.d. for 5 \ndays [n = 99], no subject had a serious adverse event, nor withdrew prematurely. In Phase \nI studies in adults, oseltamivir has been administered in multiple doses of up to 500 mg \nb.i.d. Doses of 200 mg b.i.d. and greater have been associated with increased \ngastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea and vomiting). [8] In adult subjects with \ncreatinine clearances of < 30 mL/min, doses of 100 mg b.i.d. for 6 days were well \ntolerated, despite steady-state oseltamivir carboxylate exposures approximately 10-fold \nhigher than those achieved with standard dosing in renally competent individuals. [15] \nNo other adverse effects were reported more frequently with higher doses and no serious \nadverse events have been reported within the volunteer studies. Co-administration of \noseltamivir with food has been demonstrated to substantially reduce the frequency and \nseverity of gastrointestinal side effects.  \nThus, the rationale for the higher dose arm in this study is to explore the possibility of \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance without an undue increase in \nrisk.  \nDrug interactions with immunosuppressive medications have also been evaluated. The \npharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate after administration of \n75 mg oseltamivir (conventional adult dose) in subjects with a well-functioning, stable \nrenal allograft who were being maintained on immunosuppressive therapy were studied. \nThese were similar to those described in the literature for adults with comparable degrees \nof renal function. Oseltamivir was well tolerated and had no clinically relevant effect on \nthe steady-state pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate \nmofetil. [8] \nDuration of dosing \nThe duration of dosing chosen for this population (10 days) is longer than that in the \nhealthy adult and pediatric populations (5 days). This is based on observations that the \nviral shedding and illness are typically longer in immunocompromised patients than it is \nin healthy adults. [7] [13] \nDose Adjustments \nIn this study, dose adjustment for subjects with an estimated Cr Cl between 10 to 30 \nmL/min/1.73M2 will comprise decreasing the frequency of administration to once daily. \nThis is based on current label recommendations for adults with renal impairment \n(Table 1). \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 20 \nTable 1 \nRecommended doses in healthy adults for treatment of \ninfluenza  \n \nCreatinine Clearance \nRecommended dose for treatment \n> 30 (ml/min) \n75 mg twice daily \n> 10 to \u2264 30 (ml/min) \n75 mg once daily or 30 mg suspension twice \ndaily \n\u226410 (ml/min)   \nNot recommended \ndialysis patients \nNot recommended \n \nThe dose adjustment recommendations are considered suitable approaches for children \nwith renal impairment. This is based on the reasonable assumption that a similar \nrelationship exists in both children and adults, between changes in creatinine clearance \nand resultant changes in exposure of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. Doses will \nbe adjusted for renal impairment in this protocol per the schema below.

A rapid diagnostic test for influenza \nwill be performed at the end of the 10 days of treatment. Subjects still having influenza \nbased on the rapid diagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care by the \nprincipal investigator.  \n3.2 \nNumber of Subjects/ Assignment to Treatment Groups \nA minimum of 250 patients will be enrolled in this study (approximately 125 per arm). \nAfter screening, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two active treatment \ngroups. \n3.3 \nCenters \nThis will be a multicenter study with approximately 140 centers in the Northern \nhemisphere.

However, all patients, including those who \ndiscontinue study drug prematurely and/or are treated with another antiviral, will \nbe required to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose \nof study medication (day 15 and day 40 assessments). \nSubjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  \nAn excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, \nunnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided. Should a subject decide to \nwithdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations prior to \nwithdrawal as thoroughly as possible. \nThe investigator should contact the subject or a responsible relative either by telephone or \nthrough a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the \nwithdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient\u2019s withdrawal should be \nmade with an explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study. If the reason \nfor removal of a subject from the study is an Adverse Event, the principal specific event \nwill be recorded on the CRF. \nIn the case that the subject decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment [\u201crefuses \ntreatment\u201d], he/she should be asked if he/she can still be contacted for further \ninformation.

Day 6 visit window = +/- 1 day; Day 8 visit window = +1 day.  Day 11 visit \nwindow = \u00b1 1 day. Day 15 and day  40 visit occur approximately 5 and  30 days after the last dose respectively. Day 15 \nwindow = \u00b1 1 day. Day 40 window \u00b1 2 days.  \nh.  Only weight to be assessed. Height is not necessary at this visit. Study drug is taken on day 11, only if the first dose \nwas taken after 4 PM on Day 1 [5.3] Subjects who are rapid diagnostic positive can be treated per standard of care. \nThey will be required to come for their follow-up visits on day 15 and day 40.  \ni.  Subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely will have an end of treatment (day 11) assessment at the time of \ntreatment discontinuation or the following day. They will be required to attend their follow up visits approximately 5 \nand 30 days after the last dose (day 15 and day 40 assessments).  \nj. Subjects who discontinue during follow-up will have an end of follow-up (day 40)  assessment. This visit must occur  \nwithin 30 days of the last dose.   \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 27 \n5.1 \nScreening Examination and Eligibility Screening Form  \nTrial sites will be activated during the influenza season.  \nAll subjects must provide written informed consent (assent where applicable) before any \nstudy specific assessments or procedures are performed. Screening will take place at the \nbaseline visit prior to first dose.  However, if necessary, screening may take place the \nday before the baseline visit, as long as the patient is randomized and receives \nhis/her first dose of study medication within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset. \nSubjects will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria and those who fulfill all the \ninclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study.  \nAn Eligibility Screening Form [ESF] documenting the investigator\u2019s assessment of each \nscreened subject with regard to the protocol\u2019s inclusion and exclusion criteria is to be \ncompleted by the investigator. \nA screen failure log must be maintained by the investigator.  \n5.2 \nProcedures for Enrollment of Eligible Subjects  \nOnce a subject has fulfilled the entry criteria, he/she will be randomized to one of two \ntreatment groups. The subject randomization numbers will be generated by Roche or its \ndesignee and incorporated into double-blind labeling. \nThe investigator or designee will use the CRF pre-printed with the assigned subject \nnumber and enter the randomization number provided by IVRS for allocation to the \ntreatment groups in the appropriate place on each subject\u2019s CRF. \nRandomization will be stratified by transplant type (SOT or HSCT); time between onset \nof symptoms and treatment start (\u2264 24 hrs or > 24 hrs), influenza vaccination status (Yes; \nNo) and patient\u2019s age (\u2264 12 years or > 12 years).  \n5.3 \nClinical Assessments and Procedures \nAt all visits subjects will receive the routine care for their primary illness (transplant). \nRoutine patient care (including the adjustment of doses of any of the immunosuppressive \ndrugs) will be dictated by tests performed locally at the trial site. Dose adjustments of \noseltamivir will be based on serum creatinine done at the local laboratory. All safety labs \nwill be sent to a central laboratory. Results for these laboratory parameters will be used \nby the sponsor/designee to assess overall safety. \nAll assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of \nAssessments (Table 3). Additional information regarding these procedures not provided \nin the Schedule of Assessments is provided below. \nStudy Day 1 \nThe baseline and study day 1 assessment may be performed at the same visit. \nStudy medication, electronic diaries, and thermometers will be dispensed. Patients or \nguardians/parents will be instructed how to complete electronic symptom diaries \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 28 \n(Appendix 2) (Appendix 3), temperature recording, and treatment administration details, \nincluding time of each oseltamivir dose.  The first diary entries will be made at the site \nbefore the first dose of study drug.  \nBaseline nasal and throat swab samples will be assessed for the presence of \noseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 with H274Y mutation.  As soon as they are \navailable, results will be reported to the sites to assist in patient management. \nThe date of the first dose of study drug is defined as study day 1. Once randomized, the \nfirst dose of study drug will be administered in the clinic. Study day 2 will begin at 12 \nmidnight of the same calendar day. If the first dose of study drug is taken after 4 pm on \nday 1, the next dose of study drug will be taken in the morning of day 2. In this case, the \nlast dose of study drug will be taken on the morning of study day 11.   \nIf the first dose of study drug is taken prior to 4 pm on day 1, the next dose of study drug \nshould be taken in the evening of the same day (i.e. prior to midnight on the same \ncalendar day with a minimum of 7 hours between doses). For these patients the last dose \nof study drug will be taken in the evening of study day 10. More information on dosing is \nprovided later. 6.1 \nThe study will utilize a central safety laboratory. However, to determine the correct dose, \na local serum creatinine will be drawn at baseline in all subjects and used to calculate \ncreatinine clearance to determine if a dose adjustment is necessary. No dose adjustments \nare required for subjects whose creatinine clearance is > 30 ml/min in adults (> 30 \nml/min/1.73 M2  in children). Oseltamivir dosing frequency for patients whose creatinine \nclearance is between 10 to 30 ml/min in adults (10 to 30 ml/min/1.73 M2  in children) \nwill be adjusted to once daily.  \nFor patients who meet the following criteria in section 4.2, dosing will commence only \nafter the baseline creatinine clearance are available and if baseline creatinine clearance > \n10 ml/min in adults and > 10 ml/min/1.73M2  in children.  The dose will be adjusted to \nonce daily if the baseline Cr Cl is between 10 to 30 ml/min in adults (10 to 30 \nml/min/1.73 M2  in children) \n\u2022 most recent creatinine clearance in the 6 months prior is < 30  ml/min in adults and < \n30 ml/min/1.73M2 in children)  \n\u2022 patients who have not had a creatinine clearance assessment in the 6 months prior to \nrandomization \n \nFor patients who meet the following criteria in section 4.2 dosing may commence prior to \navailability of baseline Cr Cl. Subjects will receive twice daily doses and dosing will be \nadjusted to once daily if the baseline Cr Cl is between 10 to 30 ml/min in adults (10 to 30 \nml/min/1.73 M2  in children).  \n\u2022 most  recent creatinine clearance in the 6 months prior is > 30 ml/min  in  adults  and \n> 30 ml/min /1.73M2  in children) \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 29 \nStudy Days 2 - 11 \nStudy day 2 will begin at 12 midnight of study day 1.  \nIt is expected the study staff will maintain close contact with patients, especially during \nthe first few days of the study. The study staff should inquire about any adverse events, \ncheck that the patient or parent/guardian is entering data into the electronic diary \nproperly, and assess drug compliance. During the dosing period, diary symptoms should \nbe assessed and temperature should be recorded at the same time that the study drug is \ntaken.  \nDosage adjustment will be performed based on creatinine clearance as described in the \nDose Modification section 6.1.1. \nEnd of treatment Day 11 \nThe end of treatment visit for all subjects is on day 11 (irrespective of whether they took \none or two doses on day 1). Subjects who discontinue study medication prematurely  will \nhave all day 11 assessments completed at the time of discontinuation or the following \nday.  \nAfter all day 11 study assessments are completed, a rapid diagnostic test will be \nperformed at this visit. If the rapid diagnostic test is positive, the subject may be treated \nper standard of care at the discretion of the investigator.  \nAll subjects (including those who discontinue study medication prematurely and those \nwho are positive for influenza on their rapid diagnostic  test at the end of treatment visit) \nwill be required to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose \n(day 15 and day 40 assessments)    \nStudy days 12 \u2013 40 \nStudy day 15 is an important visit as it is the first assessment of viral culture after \ncessation of treatment.  \nEnd of Follow-Up Day 40  \nAll subjects must attend an end of follow-up visit on day 40. This visit is important as it  \nis the only post-baseline visit where a serology sample for influenza antibody titers is \ncollected.  \nIf the patient is withdrawn after completion of treatment (after the day 11 assessment),  a \ntermination visit should be arranged. This visit should be the end of follow-up visit \nassessment [Day 40]. This visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.  \nPatients or parents/guardians who do not return to the clinic will be contacted by \ntelephone to ascertain their health status, or that of their child\u2019s, record information on \nadverse events, and to ask that they return the electronic diary. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 30 \n5.3.1 \nEfficacy Assessments  \nThe primary end point in this study is the time to resolution of all influenza symptoms as \nrecorded in the patient diary.  \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \n1. Symptoms of influenza-like illness. These are captured in the diary for both adults \nand children. (Appendix 2) (Appendix 3) Influenza symptoms are graded on a \nnominal scale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem). A score \nof zero is considered asymptomatic. The primary end point, time to alleviation of all \nsymptoms is comprised of all the symptoms captured in the diary.  \n2. Temperature. This is captured in the diary. Temperature is used for assessment of the \nprimary and several secondary end points.  \n5.3.2 \nSafety  \nSafety parameters in this study include adverse events, vital signs, and clinical laboratory \nevaluations.  \nPre-defined symptoms of influenza captured in the adult and pediatric diaries are not to \nbe reported as adverse events unless they can be further qualified. Thus \u2018headache due to \nstress at work\u2019 is reported as an adverse event. However, unexplained \u2018headache\u2019 is \nconsidered a predefined symptom related to influenza and not an adverse event.  \nAdverse events such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis are considered \nsecondary illnesses of influenza and should be recorded as adverse events. \nOther adverse events to be expected in the transplant population such as rejection and \ngraft versus host disease (in HSCT subjects) will also be collected as adverse events.  \n5.4 \nLaboratory Assessments \nThe laboratory assessments include those for efficacy and safety. \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza. \nThese are: \nNasal and throat swabs. Two nasal and one throat swab will be collected as described in \nthe Schedule of Assessments. All swabs are sent to a central laboratory for RT-PCR and \nviral cultures.  Influenza virus shedding will be assessed.  Baseline samples will be \nassessed for the presence of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 with the H274Y \nresistance mutation using a real-time PCR assay.  A phenotypic assay will be \nperformed to determine the susceptibility of the last positive viral isolate from each \npatient. If required, a genotypic assay to determine the contribution of both the \nneuraminidase and haemagglutinin genes to decreased susceptibility will be performed.  \nDuring the course of treatment, neither the investigator nor the patient will know which \nparticipants have ongoing positive viral cultures for influenza.  However, in order to \nassist in patient management, the results of the assay to detect influenza A H1N1 \nH274Y at baseline will be reported to the sites as soon as they are available.  At the \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 31 \nend of treatment (day 11), a rapid diagnostic test is permitted for the diagnosis of ongoing \ninfluenza.  \nSerology.  Blood samples for influenza antibody titer will be collected according to \nthe Schedule of Assessments. \n \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum \nchemistry and hematology will be done at the central laboratory. Serum chemistry \nassessments comprise AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea and creatinine. Hematology \nassessments include CBC and differential count. The total volume of blood loss for \nlaboratory assessments will be approximately 20 mL for the entire duration of the study.  \nProtection of patient confidentiality, section 16 will extend to any data generated from the \nassaying of these samples. Biological samples taken from all patients may be infectious \nand will be classified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nThe Principal Investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be assessed at the local \nlaboratory at any time during the study. The Principal Investigator may use the creatinine \nlevels to calculate creatinine clearance and adjust dose of study drug if required. \n6. \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \nThe Investigational Medical Product in this study is oseltamivir dry powder (to be \nreconstituted to a concentration of 12 mg/ml) or 75 mg capsules and matching placebo. \nThe Investigational Medicinal Products will be supplied, packaged individually for each \nsubject and labeled in accordance with Roche Standard and local regulation by Roche \nClinical Trial Supply, Basel, Switzerland.  \n6.1 \nDose and Schedule of Study Drug \nOseltamivir will be given twice daily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses. The doses need \nto be taken at 12 hourly intervals. Under no circumstances is a subject allowed to take \ntwo doses within 7 hours of each other.  \nPatients will be randomized to receive either conventional or high dose of study drug. \nConventional dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup \n\u2264 15 kg  \n \n \n30 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg   \n \n45 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg  \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg \n \n \n75 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years): Oseltamivir capsules  \n75 mg twice daily \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 32 \nSubjects randomized to the conventional dose will simultaneously receive matching \nplacebo so as to blind them and the investigator from the high dose arm.  \n \nHigh dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup  \n\u2264 15 kg  \n \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg   \n \n90 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg  \n \n120 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg \n \n \n150 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years): Oseltamivir capsules  \n150 mg twice daily  \n6.1.1 \nDose Modifications   \nNo dose adjustments/modifications are required for subjects whose creatinine clearance is \n> 30 ml/min in adults (> 30 ml/min/1.73 M2  in children). \nIn both treatment arms, the dosing frequency will be decreased to once daily in patients \nwith severe renal impairment (Cr Cl in adults between 10 \u2013 30 ml/min and children \nbetween 10 \u2013 30 ml/min/1.73M2). For example, the 75 mg bid frequency will be \ndecreased to 75 mg once daily.  \nAt any time during the study if the investigator feels that renal function is compromised, \ndosing may be decreased to once daily or withheld until such time creatinine clearance \nresults are available. Dosing may then be resumed as appropriate based on the creatinine \nclearance. However, it is vital that dosing not be inappropriately withheld for extended \nperiods of time especially in the first 3 days of treatment when viral titers may be high. It \nis also important that dose modifications are clearly and accurately recorded for \nassessment of pharmacokinetic results.  \nFor adolescents and children, the creatinine clearance will be estimated using a Schwarz \nequation: (Appendix 1) \nFor adults the method of Cockcroft-Gault will be used to estimate creatinine clearance. \n(Appendix 1) \n6.2 \nPreparation and Administration of Study Drug  \nOseltamivir will be provided in two forms:  \n1. Capsules containing 75 mg of active drug and packaging material consisting of \npregelatinized starch, povidone, talc and sodium stearyl fumarate. All participants 13 \nyears and older will receive this dosage form. Oseltamivir capsules should be stored \nat 25\u00baC.  \n2. A pediatric suspension containing 12 mg oseltamivir per ml of reconstituted solution \nand the following excipients: sorbitol, titanium dioxide, sodium benzoate, xanthan \ngum, monosodium citrate, saccharin sodium and Permaseal11900-31 Tutti Frutti \n(flavor). All participants 12 years and under will receive this dosage form. \nOseltamivir dry powder for suspension [pediatric syrup] should be stored at 25\u00baC.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 33 \nAfter reconstitution, the suspension should not be used for longer than 10 days. Store \nconstituted suspension under refrigeration at 2\u00ba to 8\u00baC.  Do not freeze. \n \nMatching placebo will be available as capsules and suspension. Subjects in the \nconventional dose arm will get the conventional dose and matching placebo so that they \nare blinded from the high dose arm.  \nEach subject will be dispensed a medication pack that will provide enough medication to \ncover 20 doses. For subjects randomized to the conventional dose arm, the medication \npack will contain a bottle of oseltamivir dry powder or a blister wallet with oseltamivir \ncapsules and matching placebo. For subjects randomized to the high dose arm, the \nmedication pack will contain two bottles of oseltamivir dry powder or two blister wallets \nwith oseltamivir capsules. Irrespective of the treatment group the subject is randomized \nto, for each dose the subject will take the same amount from both bottles or blister wallets \nprovided in the medication pack such that the sum of the amounts from each immediate \ncontainer constitutes one dose. \nOne dose is to be administered twice per day at approximately 12-hour intervals with a \nlight snack or glass of milk or fruit juice. The first dose of study medication will be \nadministered in the clinic at the time of randomization. \n6.3 \nBlinding and Unblinding \nRandomization will be administered by a central randomization center.  \nThe Randomization List will not be available at the study center, to the study monitors, \nproject statisticians or to the project team at Roche. Emergency codes, or another \nadequate method of unblinding, will be implemented before study start, if the identity of \nthe test medication is necessary for patient management in the case of a serious adverse \nevent. Emergency codes should not be broken except in the case of emergency situations. \nAny request from the investigator for information about the treatment administered to \nstudy subjects for another purpose must be discussed with Roche/designee.  \nAs per regulatory reporting requirement, Roche/designee will unblind the identity of the \nstudy medication for all unexpected [as per IB] serious adverse events that are considered \nby the investigator to be related to study drug. Details of patients who are unblinded \nduring the study will be included in the Clinical Study Report. \nAll other individuals directly involved in this study will remain blinded until the final \nanalysis of the primary parameter.  \nThe randomization will be stratified by transplant type, duration of symptoms, influenza \nvaccination status and age and will be provided by the Roche randomization group for the \nIVRS vendor.  \n6.4 \nAssessment of Compliance \nAccountability and subject compliance will be assessed by maintaining adequate \u201cdrug \ndispensing\u201d and return records.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 34 \nSubjects will be asked to return all used and unused drug supply containers at the end of \nthe treatment as a measure of compliance.  \nA Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should contain the following \ninformation: \n\u2022 the identification of the subject [randomization and medication numbers] to whom the \nstudy medication was dispensed \n\u2022 the date[s], quantity of the study medication dispensed to the subject \n\u2022 the date[s] and quantity of the study medication returned by the subject \nThis inventory must be available for inspection by the Monitor. All supplies, including \npartially used or empty containers and the dispensing logs, must be returned to the \nmonitor at the end of the study. \n6.5 \nDestruction of Study Drug \nLocal or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used \ninvestigational product for safety reasons. In these cases, it may be acceptable for \ninvestigational site staff to destroy dispensed investigational product before a monitoring \ninspection provided that source document verification is performed on the remaining \ninventory and reconciled against the documentation of quantity shipped, dispensed, \nreturned and destroyed. Written authorization must be obtained from the sponsor or \ndesignee at study start up before destruction. \nWritten documentation of destruction must contain the following: \n\u2013 Identity [batch numbers or subject numbers] of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 Quantity of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 Date of destruction \n\u2013 Method of destruction \n\u2013 Name and signature of responsible person [or company] who destroyed \ninvestigational products[s] \n7. \nSAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE \n7.1 \nAdverse Events (AEs) and Laboratory Abnormalities \n7.1.1 \nClinical AEs \nPer the International Conference of Harmonization [ICH], an AE is any untoward \nmedical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a \npharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with \nthis treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign [including \nan abnormal laboratory finding], symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use \nof a medicinal [investigational] product, whether or not considered related to the \nmedicinal [investigational] product. Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study \nare to be reported as AEs. Influenza signs and symptoms reported on the patient diary \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 35 \nwill be summarized as efficacy end points and need not be captured as adverse events.  \nHowever, secondary illnesses due to influenza must be reported as adverse events.  \n7.1.1.1 \nIntensity  \nAll clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of \nthe CRF.   \nIntensity of AEs will be graded on a four -point scale [mild, moderate, severe, \nlife-threatening] and reported in detail on the CRF.   \nMild \ndiscomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. \nModerate \ndiscomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity. \nSevere \ninability to work or perform normal daily activity \nLife Threatening \nrepresents an immediate threat to life   \n7.1.1.2 \nDrug - Adverse event relationship \nRelationship of the AE to the treatment should always be assessed by the investigator. \nDescription of scales can be found in Appendix 4. \n7.1.1.3 \nSerious Adverse Events [Immediately Reportable to Roche] \nA Serious Adverse Event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect or precaution. It is any AE that at any dose fulfils at least one \nof the following criteria: \n\u2013 is fatal; [results in death; NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event]  \n\u2013 is Life-Threatening [NOTE: the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to \nan event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe]. \n\u2013 required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \nThe full requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to. \n(Appendix 5) \n7.1.2 \nTreatment and Follow-up of AEs  \nAEs, especially those for which the relationship to test \u201cdrug\u201d is not \u201cunrelated\u201d, should \nbe followed up until they have returned to baseline status or stabilized. If a clear \nexplanation is established it should be recorded on the CRF.   \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 36 \n7.1.3 \nLaboratory Test Abnormalities \nLaboratory test results will appear printed on laboratory reports provided to the site from \nthe central lab.  \nAny laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event [SAE] \nshould be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the CRF. \nAny treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result which is clinically significant, i.e., \nmeeting one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded as a single diagnosis \non the AE page in the CRF: \n\u2022 Accompanied by clinical symptoms \n\u2022 Leading to a change in study medication [e.g. dose modification, interruption or \npermanent discontinuation] \n\u2022 Requiring a change in concomitant therapy [e.g. addition of, interruption of, \ndiscontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or \ntreatment]. \n7.1.4 \nFollow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values \nIn the event of medically significant unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the \ntests should be repeated and followed up until they have returned to the normal range \nand/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. If a clear explanation is \nestablished it should be recorded on the CRF.  \n7.2 \nHandling of Safety Parameters \n7.2.1 \nReporting of Serious Adverse Events [immediately reportable] \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious and which occurs during \nthe course of the study [as defined in section 7.1.1.3 above], regardless of the treatment \narm, must be reported to Roche or designee within one working day of the investigator \nbecoming aware of the event [expedited reporting]. \nRelated Serious Adverse Events MUST be collected and reported regardless of the time \nelapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  \nUnrelated Serious Adverse Events must be collected and reported during the study and up \nuntil the follow-up visit.  \nThe definition and reporting requirements of ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data \nManagement, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be \nadhered to. (Appendix 5) \n7.2.2 \nPregnancy  \nA female subject must be instructed to stop taking the test \u201cdrug\u201d and immediately \ninform the investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study. The investigator should \nreport all pregnancies within 24 hours to the sponsor or designee. The investigator should \ncounsel the subject, and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 37 \npossible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion \nof the pregnancy.   \nPregnancy occurring in the partner of a male subject participating in the study should be \nreported to the investigator and the sponsor or designee after the pregnant partner\u2019s \nconsent has been obtained. The partner should be counseled and followed as described \nabove if acceptable, and provides informed consent.  \n7.3 \nWarnings and Precautions  \nEvents such as convulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of \nconsciousness, confusion, abnormal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, \nanxiety, nightmares) have been reported during oseltamivir use in patients with \ninfluenza, predominately in children and adolescents.  In rare cases, these events \nresulted in accidental injury.  The contribution of oseltamivir to those events is unknown.  \nSuch events have also been reported in patients with influenza who were not taking \noseltamivir. Patients, especially children and adolescents, should be closely monitored \nfor signs of abnormal behavior. \n \nPlease refer to the attached Investigator\u2019s Brochure for additional warnings, precautions, \nand other reported adverse events. \n8. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN   \nFull details of all planned analyses will be specified in a separate Data Reporting and \nAnalysis Manual (DRAM). The methods described below are an outline of the main \nplanned analyses. \n8.1 \nPrimary and Secondary Study Endpoints \n8.1.1 \nPrimary Endpoints \nThe primary endpoint in this study is the time to alleviation of all clinical influenza \nsymptoms (recorded in the patient diary). \n8.1.2 \nSecondary Endpoints \nThe following are secondary endpoints. With the exceptions of viral load and time to \nresolution of fever, they are defined as either the occurrence or non-occurrence of the \nspecified events or the presence or absence of the specified symptoms,  \nShedding virus by culture at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15 and 40 \nShedding virus by RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 \nViral load by culture (log10TCID50/mL) at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40  \nViral load by quantitative RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15 and 40 \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 38 \nThe time (hours) from first dose of study medication until resolution of fever  \n Fever  \nCough   \nCoryza   \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or \nsinusitis) at any time during the study. \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or \nsinusitis) at any time during the study that are treated with antibiotics \nInitiation of treatment with antibiotics after randomization  \nHospitalization, and for those who are hospitalized, the duration of hospitalization \nDevelopment of rejection or GVHD \nBaseline, post-baseline and change from baseline in antibody titers \n8.1.3 \nSafety \nSafety of the treatment will be evaluated by AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs.  \nAll subjects who received at least one dose of treatment and had a safety assessment \nperformed post randomization will be included in the safety evaluation. \nIn addition to routine safety assessments, the proportion of subjects experiencing a \nrejection and/or graft versus host disease will be summarized by treatment group.  \n8.2 \nStatistical and Analytical Methods  \n8.2.1 \nStatistical Model  \n8.2.1.1 \nPrimary Variables \nA non-parametric model will be assumed with estimation of medians based on Kaplan-\nMeier methods. Subjects without alleviation of symptoms will have their time censored at \nthe last available observation that a complete assessment was made. \nFor the purpose of comparing treatment groups, it will be assumed that their respective \ndistributions for the primary endpoint differ only by a shift in location. \n8.2.1.2 \nSecondary Variables  \nFor the secondary endpoints defined dichotomously in terms of events or symptoms, it \nwill be assumed that the number of patients experiencing the event or exhibiting the \nsymptom will have a binomial distribution. \nFor the continuous endpoint of time to resolution of fever, the same assumptions as for \nthe primary endpoint will be made. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 39 \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 no model will \nbe assumed.  \n8.2.2 \nSample Size \nSample size calculations were performed using a two-sided t-test and are based on the \ncomparison with a placebo control response in the pivotal registration trials in healthy \nadults of 112 hours for median time to alleviation of all symptoms. Assuming an \nexpected median time to alleviation of symptoms of 78 hours for each of the two active \ntreatment groups in this study, and a common standard deviation of 98 hours, then 111 \nevaluable subjects per group would give more than 90% power to detect a difference \nbetween the control and each of the active treatment groups. It is assumed that as many as \n90 % of subjects enrolled into the study who are identified as not being infected with \ninfluenza A H1N1 H274Y will have influenza, and therefore 124 such subjects per arm \nwould be required in order to obtain 111 influenza positive subjects. Note that this is an \napproximate calculation, as the final analysis will be based on the difference in medians \nand the corresponding 95% confidence interval from the Kaplan-Meier curves. This is \nhowever considered as a sufficient indication for the number of required subjects and \nthe power that is expected. The maximum number of subjects enrolled in the trial will \ndepend upon the number of subjects identified with the oseltamivir resistant virus \nwho will be replaced. \n8.2.3 \nHypothesis Testing  \nFormal hypothesis testing will be not performed, instead inferences will be based on \ncomparison of confidence intervals.  \n8.2.4 \nAnalysis Populations \nThree main patient populations will be used for the analysis of data from this study; the \nSafety Population, the Intent-to treat Population and the Intent-to-Treat Infected \nPopulation . Detailed definitions of these populations will be given in the DRAM  \n8.2.4.1 \nIntent to treat population: \nAll patients randomized will be included in the intent to treat population [Patients will be \nassigned to treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes] \n8.2.4.2 \nIntent to treat infected population: \nAll patients randomized and with laboratory confirmation of influenza infection (positive \nviral cultures or 4 fold or greater rise in antibody titers), excluding patients infected \nwith oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 H274Y at baseline, will be included in \nthe intent to treat influenza infected population [Patients will be assigned to treatment \ngroups as randomized for analysis purposes] \nThe ITTI Population will be the primary population for the summary and analysis of the \nprimary and secondary efficacy variables. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 40 \n8.2.4.3 \nSubpopulations \nIn order to evaluate the potential for relapse, the following two subpopulations of the \nITTI population will be evaluated:  \n\u2022 patients not shedding virus as assessed by culture on Day 11 \n\u2022 patients not shedding virus as assessed by RT-PCR on Day 11 \nViral shedding and RT-PCR at days 15 and 40 will be evaluated in these subpopulations. \nBased on the proportion of subjects hospitalized, an additional subpopulation may be \ndefined to evaluate the length of hospitalization for hospitalized subjects. \nLikewise, based on the proportion of children enrolled additional subpopulations of \nchildren and adults will be created to evaluate the course of influenza in children and \nadults.  \n8.2.5 \nEfficacy Analysis \nFor the primary analysis, the following two assessments will be made independently of \neach other and without regard to the outcomes in each case. \n\u2022 Comparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment \napproval, a population of placebo treated patients will be established to match (in \nterms of efficacy evaluations, duration of observation etc.) those of the current study. \nFor this population, a median time to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms \nwill be determined along with its 95% confidence interval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.  These confidence intervals \nwill be compared individually to the placebo control confidence interval described \nabove as a potential means of establishing treatment effects. \n\u2022 Assessment of relative efficacy \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in \nthe median times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% \nconfidence interval. The methodology will be based on the use of the Hodges-\nLehmann estimator in the case of censored data.  \nThis confidence interval will provide lower and upper limits for the treatment difference \nand can be used as the basis for potential inferences. For example, if it does not contain \nthe value zero a difference will have been established. However, given the study sample \nsize this outcome is only likely if a clinically significant difference (e.g. 30% ) exists. \nAlthough this is not anticipated from the experience in pivotal registration trials in \nnormal healthy patients, it cannot be ruled out as a possibility in immunocompromised \ntransplant recipients.   \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 41 \nFor the dichotomous secondary endpoints, the proportion experiencing the event or \nsymptom, and its associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment \ngroup. Where possible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control \npopulation will be presented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment \ngroups in this trial. \nThe continuous secondary endpoints time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for \nthe primary endpoint.  \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load (log10TCID50/mL) at Day 1, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40, \nsummary statistics (including mean, median, minimum and maximum) will be derived \nfor each treatment group. \n8.2.5.1 \nExclusion of Data from Analysis \nEfficacy data collected from any patient who begins treatment with another \nantiviral for influenza (for example, amantadine, rimantadine, or zanamavir), after \nthe other antiviral treatment commences, will be excluded from the primary and \nsecondary efficacy analyses.  Such patients will be considered failures to oseltamivir \ntreatment in the analyses.  Further details will be provided in the DRAM. \n8.2.5.2 \nInterim Analysis \nNo interim analyses are planned.  \n8.2.6 \nSafety Data Analysis \nThe safety analysis population will include all subjects who receive at least one dose and \nhad a safety assessment performed post randomization. All safety parameters will be \nsummarized and presented in tables based on this safety population.  \n8.2.7 \nOther Analyses \nThe number and percentage of patients with influenza infection (defined as a positive \nculture from a nasal and/or throat swab or 4 fold or greater rise in antibody titers) will be \nsummarized by treatment group for the Intent-to-treat Population. \nFurther exploratory analysis, (including assessments of the rapid diagnostic test, sub \ngroup analysis) will be detailed in the DRAM. \nThe last positive viral isolate from each patient will be tested for reduced sensitivity to \noseltamivir. Clonal resistance assays will also be used to evaluate the rate of resistance to \noseltamivir. These data will be summarized in a report separate from the final study \nreport. \n9. \nDATA QUALITY ASSURANCE \nThe overall procedures for quality assurance of clinical study data are described in the \nRoche Standard Operational Procedures. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 42 \nAccurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross\u2013check of \nthe CRFs against the investigator\u2019s records by the study monitor [source document \nverification], and the maintenance of a drug\u2013dispensing log by the investigator.  \nThe data collected will be entered into the study database from the working copy of the \nCRF faxed from the site. \nA comprehensive validation check program will verify the data and discrepancy reports \nwill be generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator. As patients complete the \nstudy [or prematurely withdraw] and their signed CRFs become available, a second data \nentry will be performed from the original, signed CRF. A comparison check will be run \nto identify and resolve any discrepancies between the first and second data entry. \nThroughout the study the Study Management Team [SMT] will review data according to \nthe SMT Data Review Plan as described in the Data Quality Plan.  \n9.1 \nAssignment of Preferred Terms and Original Terminology \nFor classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by the sponsor to the original \nterms entered on the CRF, using the current version of MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for \nRegulatory Activities terminology) for adverse events and diseases and the INN \n(International Non-Proprietary name) drug terms and procedures dictionary for \ntreatments and surgical and medical procedures. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 43 \n10. \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in \u201cGuideline for Good \nClinical Practice\u201d ICH Tripartite Guideline [January 1997] or with local law if it affords \ngreater protection to the subject. For studies conducted in the EU/EEA countries, the \ninvestigator will ensure compliance with the EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC].  \nFor studies conducted in the USA or under US IND, the investigator will additionally \nensure that the basic principles of \u201cGood Clinical Practice\u201d as outlined in the current \nversion of 21 CFR, subchapter D, part 312, \u201cResponsibilities of Sponsors and \nInvestigators\u201d, part 50, \u201cProtection of Human Subjects\u201d, and part 56, \u201cInstitutional \nReview Boards\u201d, are adhered to. \nIn other countries where \u201cGuideline for Good Clinical Practice\u201d exist Roche and the \ninvestigators will strictly ensure adherence to the stated provisions. \n11.2 \nInformed Consent  \n It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator [if \nacceptable by local regulations], to obtain written informed consent from each subject \nparticipating in this study, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated \nbenefits, and potential hazards of the study. For subjects not qualified or incapable of \ngiving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legally acceptable \nrepresentative. In the case where both the subject and his/her legally acceptable \nrepresentative are unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire \ninformed consent discussion. After the subject and representative have orally consented \nto participation in the trial, the witness\u2019 signature on the form will attest that the \ninformation in the consent form was accurately explained and understood. The \ninvestigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are completely free to refuse \nto enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason. The Case Report \nForms [CRFs] for this study contain a section for documenting informed subject consent, \nand this must be completed appropriately. If new safety information results in significant \nchanges in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated \nif necessary. All subjects [including those already being treated] should be informed of \nthe new information, given a copy of the revised form and give their consent to continue \nin the study. \nIf children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the study, they should \nalso be informed and should also provide their written consent. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 46 \n11.3 \nIndependent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Board  \nIndependent Ethics Committees [non-US]:  This protocol and any accompanying \nmaterial provided to the subject [such as subject information sheets or descriptions of the \nstudy used to obtain informed consent] as well as any advertising or compensation given \nto the patient, will be submitted by the investigator to an Independent Ethics Committee. \nApproval from the committee must be obtained before starting the study, and should be \ndocumented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the committee met \nand granted the approval. \nAny modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the Independent Ethics \nCommittee approval must also be submitted by the investigator to the Committee in \naccordance with local procedures and regulatory requirements. \nWhen no local review board exists, the investigator is expected to submit the protocol to \na regional committee. If no regional committee exists, Roche will assist the investigator \nin submitting the protocol to the European Ethics Review Committee. \nInstitutional Review Board [US]:  It is the understanding of the sponsor that this \nprotocol [and any modifications] as well as appropriate consent procedures, will be \nreviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board. This board must operate in \naccordance with the current Federal Regulations. A letter or certificate of approval will \nbe sent by the investigator to the  sponsor or designee prior to initiation of the study, and \nalso whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made. \n12. \nCONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL \nProtocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between \nan appropriate representative of the sponsor and the investigator [investigator \nrepresentative[s] in the case of a multicenter trial].  Protocol modifications must be \nprepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially reviewed and approved by the \nClinical Science Leader/Clinical Pharmacologist and Biostatistician. \nAll protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Independent Ethics \nCommittee or Institutional Review Board for information and approval in accordance with \nlocal requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required. Approval must be awaited \nbefore any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an \nimmediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the change[s] involves only logistical or \nadministrative aspects of the trial [e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone \nnumber[s]. \n13. \nCONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY \nBoth the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  \nShould this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual study \nbasis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, Roche and the investigator \nwill assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient\u2019s interests. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 47 \n14. \nSTUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS AND RECORD KEEPING \n14.1 \nInvestigator's Files / Retention of Documents \nThe Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of \nthe study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These \ndocuments should be classified into two different separate categories [1] Investigator's \nStudy File, and [2] subject clinical source documents. \nThe Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, Case Report and \nQuery Forms, Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and \ngovernmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, \nstaff \ncurriculum \nvitae \nand \nauthorization \nforms \nand \nother \nappropriate \ndocuments/correspondence etc.  \nSubject clinical source documents [usually defined by the project in advance to record \nkey efficacy/safety parameters independent of the CRFs] would include patient \nhospital/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original \nlaboratory reports, ECG, EEG, X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed \ninformed consent forms, consultant letters, and subject screening and enrollment logs. \nThe Investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least 15 years \nafter completion or discontinuation of the study. After that period of time the documents \nmay be destroyed, subject to local regulations.  \nShould the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to \nanother location, Roche must be notified in advance. \nIf the Investigator can not guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site \nfor any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the \nInvestigator and Roche to store these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that \nthey can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source \ndocuments are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies should be \nmade for storing outside of the site. \n14.2 \nSource Documents and Background Data \nThe investigator shall supply the sponsor or designee on request with any required \nbackground data from the study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly \nimportant when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are suspected. In \ncase of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, it \nis also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that patient \nconfidentiality is protected. \n14.3 \nAudits and Inspections \nThe investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made \navailable to appropriately qualified personnel from the Roche Pharma Development   \nQuality Assurance Unit or its designees, or to health authority inspectors after appropriate \nnotification. The verification of the CRF data must be by direct inspection of source \ndocuments. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234B  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 48 \n14.4 \nCase Report Forms \nFor each patient enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal \ninvestigator or authorized delegate from the study staff. This also applies to records for \nthose patients who fail to complete the study [even during a pre-randomization screening \nperiod if a CRF was initiated]. If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be \nnoted on the CRF. If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment-\nlimiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. \nAll forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink, and must be legible. Errors \nshould be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed \nand dated by the investigator or his/her authorized delegate. The investigator should \nensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported to the  \nsponsor or designee in the CRFs and in all required reports. \n15. \nMONITORING THE STUDY \nIt is understood that the responsible Roche monitor [or designee] will contact and visit \nthe investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the various records \nof the trial [CRFs and other pertinent data] provided that patient confidentiality is \nmaintained in accord with local requirements. \nIt will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout \nthe study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and \naccuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to laboratory \ntest reports and other patient records needed to verify the entries on the CRF. The \ninvestigator [or his/her deputy] agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any \nproblems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. \n16. \nCONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT \nRECORDS \nThe investigator must assure that subjects\u2019 anonymity will be maintained and that their \nidentities are protected from unauthorized parties. On CRFs or other documents \nsubmitted to the  sponsor or designee, subjects should not be identified by their names, \nbut by an identification code. The investigator should keep a subject enrollment log \nshowing codes, names and addresses. The investigator should maintain documents not for \nsubmission to Roche, e.g., subjects\u2019 written consent forms, in strict confidence. \n17. \nPUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS \nThe results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is \nforeseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Roche prior to \nsubmission.

        "Content": "Furthermore, since the original study design, and particularly following the pandemic, \nthere has been increasing evidence for efficacy in the immunocompromised population.  \nNational guidelines now recommend the use of anti-virals for the treatment of influenza \nin the transplant population.  In immunocompromised patients, however, there remains \nthe risk for resistance.  It was therefore decided to revise the primary objective of this \nstudy to the descriptive characterization of safety, tolerability and resistance.   \n5. \nSUBJECT:  MODIFICATION OF SAMPLE SIZE \nReason for change:   \nThe original sample size was determined to provide an adequate number of patients for \nanalysis with a primary objective of efficacy.  The sample size has been revised to reflect \nthe amended primary objective of safety/tolerability and the development of resistant \ninfluenza virus, whilst still allowing for an adequate number of patients with influenza A.  \n6. \nSUBJECT:  RENAL IMPAIRMENT   \nReason for change:   \nWhile the dosing recommended for patients with renal failure in version B of the protocol \ncontinues to be safe, it is anticipated that Roche will develop more specific dosing \nguidelines for patients with renal failure.  It was therefore decided to discontinue study \nmedication for all patients with renal failure (CrCl < 60mL/min/1.73M2).   \n7. \nSUBJECT:  DELETING SPECIFIC RESISTANCE MUTATIONS \nReason for change:   \nDue to the circulation of a wild type oseltamivir resistant H274Y strain of influenza A \nH1N1 in the 2007/8 and 2008/9 Northern hemisphere influenza seasons, baseline PCR to \ndetect the strain was introduced in version B of the protocol.

However, in children, the elderly \nand the immunocompromised, influenza infection can be associated with substantial \nmorbidity and mortality [1].  In patients with compromised immunity, influenza virus \nmay cause severe lower respiratory tract involvement; unusual syndromes, including \nencephalitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis and death [3].  \nConditions that compromise immunity may be classified based on etiology into \nprimary (genetic) and secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency.  Of the \nimmunodeficient conditions, the ones that affect cell mediated immunity are likely \nto have adverse outcomes following viral infections [20]. \nPrimary immunodeficiency  \nPrimary immunodeficiencies are relatively common, may be either congenital or \nmanifest later in life and are classified according to whether the genetic defect \naffects T or B cells or both [20].  There are four groups of disorders: severe \ncombined immunodeficiency (SCID), primary T cell deficiency (e.g. CD8 deficiency, \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 7 \nDiGeorge syndrome), predominantly antibody deficiency (e.g. common variable \nimmunodeficiency, \nselective \nIgA \ndeficiency) \nand \nother \nwell-defined \nimmunodeficiency syndromes (e.g. Wiskott Aldrich syndrome) [20].  \nOf the primary immunodeficiencies, antibody deficiencies are the most frequent. \nHowever some of the more common antibody deficiency conditions (isolated IgA \ndeficiency, IgG subclass deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency) have \nintact cell-mediated immunity and therefore the clinical course of viral infections \n(unless complicated by bacterial infections) does not differ significantly from that in \nthe normal host [20].  A list of primary immunodeficiency disorders at risk for viral \ninfections is provided in Appendix 6A.  The incidence of some of these conditions \nhas been estimated.  The incidence of SCID is 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 [20].  \nThe more severe forms of primary immunodeficiency are relatively rare, have their \nonset early in life, and all too frequently result in death during childhood [20].  \nSecondary Immunodeficiency \nSecondary immunodeficiencies are not caused by intrinsic abnormalities in \ndevelopment of T and B cells [20].  Secondary immunodeficiency may result from \ndiseases (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hematologic malignancy) or \nimmunosuppressive and cytotoxic drugs (such as those used for treatment of \ntransplant recipients, collagen vascular disease, malignancies). \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to disease \nHIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ T cell count of < 200/\u00b5L are highly \nsusceptible \nto \nopportunistic \ndisease \n[20]. \n \nStudies \nin \nHIV/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) subjects have shown an increased risk for \nheart and lung-related hospitalizations during the influenza season compared to \nother times of the year, prolonged duration of influenza symptoms, increased risk \nfor influenza-related complications and a higher risk of influenza-related death [21]. \nSeveral hematologic malignancies affect the immune system (Appendix 7).  Several \nauthors have reported influenza in children and adults with hematologic \nmalignancies [22, 23, 24, 25]. \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to drugs (e.g. transplant recipients, collagen \nvascular disease, malignancies) \nThe enhanced survival of the transplant population following the availability of \nnewer immunosuppressive drugs has made them representative of the \nimmunocompromised population in general; and secondary immunodeficiency due \nto drugs, in particular. \nIn transplant recipients influenza is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary \ncomplications, extrapulmonary manifestations and an increased risk of graft dysfunction \nand high attributable mortality.  In a cohort study of influenza viral infection in solid \norgan transplant (SOT) subjects, 30 cases of influenza viral infection were identified.  \nSecondary bacterial pneumonia was seen in 17% of subjects and three SOT recipients \n(2 liver and one kidney) had myositis, myocarditis and bronchiolitis obliterans.  Biopsy \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 8 \nof the transplanted organ was performed in 21 of 30 cases and revealed variable degrees \nof acute allograft rejection in 62% of subjects.  The study concluded that influenza was \nassociated with significant morbidity in different groups of SOT recipients [5].  \nAmong transplant recipients, subjects with hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) \nare at the greatest risk for morbidity.  In a prospective study from the Infectious Diseases \nWorking Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 1973 \npatients were evaluated for respiratory virus infections after stem cell transplant.  The \noverall mortality was 23% from influenza A infection and the direct influenza A-\nassociated mortality was 15.3% in this study [6].  A large retrospective study (4797 \nsubjects undergoing HSCT over a 13-year period) identified 62 patients with \ninfluenza of whom as many as 29% (18 of 62 patients) developed pneumonia.  Ten \npercent of the subjects with influenza died [7].  \nThe increased morbidity in transplant patients is associated with increased duration of \nvirus shedding compared to that in healthy subjects. In otherwise healthy adults, elderly \nsubjects and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated subjects was 70, \n96 and 118 hours respectively [8].  In contrast, in the retrospective HSCT study, \ninfluenza virus was shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a \nmedian duration of 168 hours (7 days, range 2 to 37 days) [7]. \nCurrently available treatments for influenza infection are the M2 ion channel inhibitors \n(e.g. amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir, \nzanamivir). \nOld text: \nInfluenza infection is usually a self limiting condition. However, in children, the elderly \nand the immunocompromised, influenza infection can be associated with substantial \nmorbidity and mortality [1].  In patients with compromised immunity, influenza virus \nmay cause severe lower respiratory tract involvement; unusual syndromes, including \nencephalitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis and death. [3]  The availability of new \nimmunosuppressive agents has enhanced the number and survival of solid organ \ntransplant (SOT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) [4] recipients making \nthem representative of the larger immunocompromised patient population.   \nIn transplant recipients influenza is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary \ncomplications, extrapulmonary manifestations and an increased risk of graft dysfunction \nand high attributable mortality. In a cohort study of influenza viral infection in SOT \nsubjects, 30 cases of influenza viral infection were identified. Secondary bacterial \npneumonia was seen in 17 % of subjects and three SOT recipients (2 liver and one \nkidney) had myositis, myocarditis and bronchiolitis obliterans. Biopsy of the transplanted \norgan was performed in 21 of 30 cases and revealed variable degrees of acute allograft \nrejection in 62 % of subjects. The study concluded that influenza was associated with \nsignificant morbidity in different groups of SOT recipients [5].  \nAmong transplant recipients, subjects with HSCT are at the greatest risk for morbidity. In \na prospective study from the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the European Group \nfor Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 1973 patients were evaluated for respiratory virus \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 9 \ninfections after stem cell transplant.  The overall mortality was 23% from influenza A \ninfection and the direct influenza A-associated mortality was 15.3% in this study [6]. \nThe largest study of influenza infections in transplant (allogenic, syngenic or autologous \nHSCT) subjects comes from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, USA. In this \nretrospective study, influenza virus was isolated in 62 of 4797 subjects undergoing HSCT \nover a 13-year period. During this period, the Center had a standardized protocol for the \ndetection of respiratory pathogens comprising direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining \nand viral culture. Because capture of influenza infections and accurate ascertainment of \nall risk factors was less complete after discharge from the health care center, only \ninfections that occurred during the first 120 days after transplantation were considered. \nInfluenza was defined as the isolation of influenza virus by culture or as evidence of \ninfluenza antigen detected by DFA in conjunction with consistent symptomatology.  \nAntiviral treatment with an M2 inhibitor or oseltamivir (available since 1999) was \nperformed at the discretion of the investigator. Unlike the fixed dosing duration \nrecommended for antivirals in healthy subjects, in this trial, treatment was continued until \nresolution of presenting signs and symptoms and clearance of virus from respiratory \nsecretions. Garrett Nichols, et al, reported as many as 29 % of subjects developed \npneumonia following influenza infection in this large retrospective study. Ten percent of \nthe subjects with influenza died [7].  \nThe increased morbidity in transplant patients is associated with increased duration of \nvirus shedding compared to that in healthy subjects. In otherwise healthy adults, elderly \nsubjects and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated subjects was 70, \n96 and 118 hours respectively. [8] In contrast, in the retrospective HSCT study, influenza \nvirus was shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a median \nduration of 168 hours (7 days, range 2 to 37 days) [7]. This median duration of shedding \nincluded both allogenic and autologous HSCT subjects and both treated and untreated \nsubjects. The mean duration of shedding in treated and untreated allogenic HSCT \nsubjects was found to be longer than in autologous HSCT subjects (11.1 versus 6.7 days).  \nJohny et al, evaluated the use of zanamivir in the treatment of influenza in seven \nallogenic bone marrow transplant subjects.  As with the large retrospective HSCT study, \ntheir standard of care also was to continue zanamivir until symptoms had subsided and it \nwas documented that viral excretion had ceased. Viral shedding was checked every 7 \ndays. Based on this protocol, the median duration of use of zanamivir was 15 days with a \nrange of 5 to 44 days [9]. \nCurrently available treatments for influenza infection are the M2 ion channel inhibitors \n(e.g. amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir, \nzanamivir). Due to the emergence of resistant virus, the Center for Disease Control \n(CDC) has made an interim recommendation that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be \nused for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in the United States. [10] Oseltamivir \nis therefore one of the main drugs available for the evaluation of the treatment of \ninfluenza in the immunocompromised population. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 10 \nSection 1.1.2 Oseltamivir \nNew text: \nThe safety profile of oseltamivir has been well characterized for the prophylaxis \nindication in a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial conducted in the \nadult and pediatric immunocompromised (HSCT and SOT) population.  In the \noseltamivir group, the indications for transplant included hematologic malignancies \n(acute and chronic leukemias, multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome), \nlymphoid malignancies (Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphomas), primary \nimmunodeficiencies (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative \ndisease and severe combined immunodeficiency).  Other rare indications included \nbone marrow aplasia, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, myelofibrosis and \nmultiple sclerosis.  In the safety population, there were 239 subjects randomized to \nthe conventional dose of oseltamivir and 238 to placebo.  The total number of \nadverse events reported in the placebo group (361 events) was generally similar to \nthat in the oseltamivir group (323 events).  Diarrhea was the most frequently \nreported adverse event (placebo, 8%; oseltamivir, 6%).  There were no deaths in the \noseltamivir group.  Oseltamivir was found to be safe in immunosuppressed \ntransplant recipients [26]. \nLimited safety and/or efficacy of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is available \nfrom several case reports in children and adolescents.  Oseltamivir was shown to be \nsafe and/or effective in HIV infected children (n=10) [27], children (age 3 to 12 \nyears) with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n=10) [25], in a nosocomial H1N1 \noutbreak in a pediatric (children aged 10 months to 13 years) oncology ward (n=8) \n[24], in children and adolescents (age 2 to 19 years) with malignancies (ALL, \nneuroblastoma, brain tumor, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing \nsarcoma, myelodysplasia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Wilms tumor, aplastic \nanemia, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia) \n(n=51) [22], in children aged 4 to 14 years on immunosuppressive drugs (n=5) [28] \nand in children (aged 5 months to 5 years) with bone marrow transplant (n=3) [29]. \nOseltamivir has also been shown to be safe and/or effective in mixed populations of \nchildren and adults (62 patients) with HSCT [7], and in a large epidemiologic study \n(n=221) with SOT [30].  \nFinally, \noseltamivir \nhas \nbeen \nshown \nto \nbe \nsafe \nand/or \neffective \nin \nimmunocompromised adults with HSCT [13] and adults with lung transplant [31, \n32, 33].  \nThe dose of oseltamivir was the same as the conventional dose in a majority of these \nreports.  In one report as many as 25 adult patients received twice the conventional \ndose [30] while in another report, three of nine adult patients received twice the \nconventional dose [33].  Treatment with oseltamivir generally ranged from 5 to 10 \ndays [32, 33, 30] and occasionally until the patient was symptom free [32, 33].  In \nexceptional cases treatment was given for as long as 20 days [22] or for as long as \nthe patient was positive by RT-PCR [25]. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 11 \nThere \nis \nsome \nconcern \nabout \nthe \ndevelopment \nof \nresistance \nin \nthe \nimmunocompromised population.  During the pandemic influenza season, more \nthan 23,000 clinical isolates of novel H1N1 pandemic virus were tested for resistance \nin the 6 international WHO regions.  A total of 225 isolates (from 225 subjects) were \nresistant (H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase coding sequence) to oseltamivir for \nan approximate incidence of 1%.  Information on immune status was available for \n142 of 225 patients.  Among the 142 patients, 56 (40%) were immunocompromised \n[34].  Prolonged viral replication and lack of immune-mediated virus clearance in \nimmunosuppressed patients treated with antivirals can result in a higher incidence \nof selection of drug-resistant viruses, a phenomenon that has been documented \npreviously [35, 36]. \nOld text: \nThere have been no controlled studies of oseltamivir treatment or prophylaxis in \nimmunocompromised subjects. In the study by Garrett Nichols et al, patients who did not \nreceive antiviral therapy shed virus for longer periods (mean duration, 11.3 days) than did \nthose who were treated with M2 inhibitors (mean duration, 9.7 days) or neuraminidase \ninhibitors (mean duration, 7.5 days). Therapy with oseltamivir (but not rimantadine) \nappeared to be associated with shorter duration of shedding after controlling for steroid \ndose (p < 0.08). [7].  The efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza in the \nimmunocompromised population has also been demonstrated in other studies. In another \nsmall trial of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza infection in subjects following \nHSCT, only two patients (5.1 %) developed influenza-related pneumonia. [13] In this \nstudy, all 39 HSCT subjects with influenza were treated with antivirals (oseltamivir or \namantadine).  In as many as 43 % of subjects, the duration of illness was greater than 7 \ndays. This is unlike data from healthy adults, suggesting the possible need to evaluate a \nhigher dose and/or longer duration of treatment with oseltamivir for this population.    \nWhile the efficacy of antiviral agents for influenza has been demonstrated in the \notherwise healthy population, it has not been tested prospectively in the \nimmunocompromised (transplant) population. [4] There is therefore a need to confirm the \nefficacy of antiviral therapy for influenza in prospective controlled trials in this patient \npopulation. \nSection 1.2 Rationale for the Study \nNew text: \nBecause of the increasing body of evidence (Section 1.1.2), oseltamivir is now \nrecommended in national guidelines as an option for the treatment of influenza in \nthe transplant population [40].  As the transplant population is considered \nrepresentative of the immunocompromised population, the primary objective of this \nstudy is to evaluate safety and resistance, while evaluating efficacy as a secondary \nobjective. \nOld text: \nThis study is designed to investigate the optimal therapy for influenza in \nimmunocompromised transplant recipients. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 12 \nThe rationale for conducting this study in the immunocompromised population is based \non the following: \n1. Immunocompromised subjects are at the highest risk for morbidity and mortality \nfrom influenza \n2. Immunocompromised subjects are at the greatest risk for contracting influenza \nbecause immunization may be ineffective in this population \n3. There is no drug approved for the treatment of influenza in this population \n \nSection 2.1 Primary Objective \nNew text: \nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate prospectively the safety and \ntolerability of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised \npatients and characterize the effects of oseltamivir in immunocompromised patients \non the development of resistant influenza virus. \nOld text: \nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of oseltamivir \nfor the treatment of influenza in transplant recipients as measured by the time to \nresolution of influenza symptoms. \nSection 2.2 Secondary Objectives \nNew text: \nTo \nevaluate \nthe \neffects \nof \nconventional \nand \nhigh \ndose \noseltamivir \nin \nimmunocompromised patients on: \n\u2022 The time to resolution of influenza symptoms. \n\u2022 The clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis).  \n\u2022 The virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntime points). \n \nOld text: \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and high dose oseltamivir in transplant recipients \non: \n\u2022 The clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis)  \n\u2022 The virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntime points) \n\u2022 Patient safety and tolerability  \n\u2022 The development of  resistant influenza virus  \n\u2022 To characterize the population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir (e.g. clearance, \nvolume of distribution) in transplant recipients \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 13 \nSection 3.1 Overview of Study Design and Dosing Regimen \nNew text: \nThis is a double blind, randomized, stratified, multi-center trial of conventional and high \ndose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients.  \nImmunocompromised patients who develop an influenza-like illness with a positive \nrapid diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture for influenza, will be enrolled during the \ninfluenza season.  Patients will be stratified by transplant status [yes, no], the time \nbetween onset of influenza symptoms and treatment start (up to 96 hours) [\u2264 48 hours; \n> 48 hours], influenza vaccination status for current influenza season [Yes; No] and by \nage [\u2264 12 years; > 12 years].  Eligible patients will be consented and randomized to \nreceive oseltamivir twice daily for 10 days in one of two treatment arms: conventional \ndose or high dose (double the conventional dose). \nOld text: \nThis is a double blind, randomized, stratified, multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy of \nconventional and high dose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in \nimmunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised transplant recipients who develop \nan influenza-like illness with a positive rapid diagnostic test for influenza, will be \nenrolled during the influenza season.  Patients will be stratified by type of transplant \n[SOT or HSCT], by the time between onset of symptoms and treatment start [\u2264 24 hours; \n> 24 hours], influenza vaccination status for current flu season [Yes; No] and by age \n[\u226412 years; >12 years].

The primary end point in the study is the time \nto alleviation of all symptoms.  \nIn this study, immunocompromised subjects will be represented by the transplant \npopulation. This is justified because the availability of new immunosuppressive agents \nhas enhanced the number and survival of SOT and HSCT recipients, making them \nrepresentative of the larger immunocompromised patient population.    \nHeterogeneity in the transplant population could confound the assessment of safety and \nefficacy in this study. Consequently, the SOT population in the protocol excludes \nsubjects with transplants other than liver, kidney or liver and kidney. However, in order \nto still be representative of the transplant community in particular and the \nimmunocompromised community in general, the study specifically includes subjects at \nthe greatest risk for morbidity and mortality from influenza - the HSCT subjects. The \nstudy also excludes subjects with comorbid conditions that might impact the metabolism \nand excretion of the drug. As the prodrug and active drug accumulate in the presence of \nhepatic and severe renal impairment respectively, subjects with hepatic or severe renal \nimpairment are excluded from the study.  Other comorbid conditions that might preclude \nthe assessment of efficacy and safety are also excluded from the study. These are \nreflected in several of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 14 \nSection 3.1.1 Rationale for Study Design \nNew text: \nThis study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo controlled \ntrials.  \nThere is no placebo control arm in this study as it was considered unethical for this \nhigh risk population.  The development of resistance following treatment with \noseltamivir (one of the primary objectives of the study) is an objective assessment \n(determined by laboratory tests) and is unlikely to be impacted by the absence of a \nplacebo arm.  \nAs a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this population, an alternative \ncontrol arm had to be identified for efficacy end points.  The response to placebo in \npivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was \nchosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial.  In order to do this, the \nend points were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal registration trials.  \nThe following sections provide rationale and justification for specific aspects of the study \ndesign which differ from the currently approved dosing for influenza or from \nprevious pivotal registration trials.  They also provide information on how the results \nwill be used to make recommendations on dose and duration of treatment. \nOld text: \nThis study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo controlled \ntrials. At the outset, a patient population that represents the general immunocompromised  \npopulation had to be defined. As a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this \npopulation, an alternative control arm had to be identified. The response to placebo in \npivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was \nchosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial. In order to do this, the \ncurrent study design and end points were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal \nregistration trials.  \nRoutine influenza surveillance during the 2007/2008 influenza season showed a \nsignificant increase in the global circulation of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus (A \nH1N1 with H274Y mutation).  Therefore, baseline nasal and throat swab samples will be \nassessed for the presence of the H274Y-mutated influenza virus and results will be \nreported to clinical sites to assist in determining the most appropriate treatment options \nfor individual patients. \nThe following sections provide rationale and justification for the specific aspects of the \nstudy design. They also provide information on how the results will be used to make \nrecommendations on dose and duration of treatment. \nSection 3.1.1.1 Choice of Treatment Arms and Duration of Treatment \nNew text: \nThe currently approved dose of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is the \nconventional dose with a duration of five days.  In this study a conventional and \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 15 \nhigh dose (twice the conventional dose) are being evaluated.  The pivotal registration \ntrials for oseltamivir in healthy adults with influenza had three treatment arms, two active \n(75 mg and 150 mg) and one placebo.  Both treatment arms were found to be \nsignificantly better than placebo.  No statistical comparisons were made between the two \nactive treatment arms.  Evaluation of the results in the two active treatment arms did not \nreveal any clinically meaningful difference.  However, the proportion of subjects \nshedding virus on day 4 (3 days after the start of treatment), suggested a possible \ndose response relationship (36%, 28% and 23% in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg \ndose arms respectively).  Because defective immune-mediated virus clearance in \nimmunosuppressed patients treated with antivirals can result in a higher incidence \nof selection of drug-resistant viruses, it was decided to use both the conventional and \nhigh dose arm for this study.  A longer duration of treatment was chosen because a \nlarge retrospective study has shown that  the median duration of viral shedding of \n7 days [7] was greater for HSCT recipients than that seen in the healthy children, \nadult and elderly population with influenza (Section 1.1.1) [8]. \nOld text: \nThe pivotal registration trials for oseltamivir in healthy adults with influenza had three \ntreatment arms, two active (75 mg and 150 mg) and one placebo. Both treatment arms \nwere found to be significantly better than placebo. No statistical comparisons were made \nbetween the two active treatment arms. Evaluation of the results in the two active \ntreatment arms did not reveal any clinically meaningful difference. Based on these \nstudies, the approved (conventional) dose for the treatment of influenza in adults is \n75 mg. \nA similar trial design was envisaged for this immunocompromised population. In an \nimmunocompromised population there is a possibility of increased efficacy with a higher \ndose. In the trials in healthy adults, on day 4 (3 days after the start of treatment), the \nproportion of subjects shedding virus suggested a possible dose response relationship \n(36%, 28% and 23% in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg dose arms respectively). In \nhealthy adults, this difference in the rate of viral shedding did not translate to any \ndifference in clinical response in the two active treatment arms even though both active \ntreatment \narms \nwere \nsignificantly \nbetter \nthan \nthe \nplacebo \narm. \nIn \nthe \nimmunocompromised population too it is possible that while there might not be any \ndifference between the two active treatment arms, one or both of these dose arms may be \nbetter than placebo. In this immunocompromised population, there is therefore an even \ngreater need to evaluate the efficacy of a higher dose arm.  \nAs with the trials in healthy adults, the ideal trial design for the current study would be \none that compared efficacy of the conventional and high dose arms with placebo. \nHowever, as reviewed in an earlier section 1.1.1 the morbidity and mortality from \ninfluenza in the immunocompromised population is far greater than that in healthy adults. \nThus in one study as many as 29 % of subjects with HSCT developed pneumonia \nfollowing influenza infection. [7] In another study in SOT recipients, biopsy of the \ntransplanted organ revealed variable degrees of acute allograft rejection in 62 % of \nsubjects. [5] Given the extent of morbidity, a placebo control appears unethical. This is \nfurther supported by a feasibility survey conducted by the Sponsor which demonstrated  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 16 \nthat a majority of transplant sites actually used antivirals (including oseltamivir) to treat \ninfluenza in this population. It was therefore decided to compare the conventional and \nhigher dose arms with the placebo arm from the pivotal registration trials in healthy \nadults with influenza. Although this approach poses limitations, the Sponsor has made \nevery effort to make sure that the results from such an approach are still meaningful. The \nfollowing sections describe how the study design addresses these limitations. \nSection 3.1.1.2 Inclusion of Patients Symptomatic up to 96 Hours \n(new section-previous section replaced) \nNew text: \nIn immunocompromised patients, time from onset of symptoms to seeking medical \nattention (presentation at the clinic) of > 48 hours has been shown in several case \nreports [37, 31, 32, 33] including two instances of nosocomial outbreaks in children \n[29, 24].  This notwithstanding, oseltamivir has been shown to be effective in \nimmunocompromised populations that included patients treated with oseltamivir \nbeyond 48 hours of presentation; patients with lung transplant (median time to \npresentation 3 days) [31], bone marrow transplant (treatment started more than \n48 hours after onset of symptoms in all three patients) [29], organ transplant (62 out \nof 221 patients started treatment after  96 hours) [30] and children with ALL (one \nchild presented after 3 days and two children after 5 days of symptoms) [25]. \nIn a prospective, observational study involving adults hospitalized with influenza, \nthe study authors concluded that \u2018Weakened host defenses slow viral clearance, \nwhereas antivirals started within the first four days of illness enhance viral \nclearance\u2019 [38].  \nAdditionally, in November 2009, in a communication for clinicians on antiviral \ntreatments for H1N1, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nstated that while antiviral treatment is most effective when started early; both \noutpatients with risk factors and hospitalized patients still benefit when treatment \nwith oseltamivir is started more than 48 hours after illness onset [39]. \nOld text: \nReplaced Section 3.1.1.2 Consistency with Previous Influenza Treatment Studies \nIn order to be able to compare the study findings with the response to placebo in healthy \nadults, this study has been intentionally designed to be consistent with previous \nregistration trials for treatment of influenza in healthy adults. Some of the key design \nfeatures consistent with previous studies include: two active treatment arms, subjects with \ninfluenza like symptoms recruited during the flu season, use of a patient diary to capture \nsymptoms, primary clinical end point based on diary assessments, laboratory evaluation \nof virology and serology samples generally similar to previous trials and the primary \nefficacy analysis population is the Intent to treat Infected (ITTI) population. \nDespite the above considerations, there are issues that can preclude the estimation of the \nresponse to placebo in an immunocompromised population comprising adults and \nchildren from that in healthy adults with influenza. To further mitigate this, the choice of \nendpoints and their interpretation is vital. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 17 \nSection 3.1.1.3 Interpretation of Study Results \nNew text: \nSafety and tolerability and the development of resistance are the primary objectives \nof this study.  These will be characterized descriptively.  For the secondary objective \nof efficacy, the subset of the population enrolled in the first 48 hours will be \ncompared with placebo patients from pivotal registration trials (where patients were \nenrolled in the first two days of illness).  Sections 8.2.5, 8.2.6, and 8.2.7 provide \ndetails on the statistical considerations and their rationale associated with these \ncomparisons. \nStratification \nStratification in this study has no bearing on any comparisons with results from previous \ntrials.  However, in order to evaluate a dose response relationship between the two active \ntreatment arms in this trial, stratification remains essential.  \nPatients will be stratified by transplant status (yes, no) because transplant patients \nform a relatively large homogenous group in this study and might influence \noutcome.  \nPatients will be stratified by time between onset of symptoms and treatment start (< 48 \nhours or \u2265 48 hours) because previous experience in otherwise healthy adults and \nchildren has shown that patients treated early in their illness respond to treatment better \nthan those who are treated later. Patients will also be stratified by age (\u2264 12 years and \n> 12 years) because otherwise healthy children shed virus longer than otherwise healthy \nadults.  It is expected that a similar difference in the duration of viral shedding would \nexist between immunocompromised children and adults.  As vaccinated subjects may \nrespond faster to therapy, the study is also stratified based on influenza vaccination status \nfor the current influenza season (Yes; No). \nOld text: \nChoice of primary end point and comparators \nThe current study includes both children and adults. This is because of the significant \nunmet need in both these age groups. The primary end point therefore had to be \napplicable to both age groups. In registration trials in adults, the primary end point was \nthe time to resolution of all clinical symptoms (in the diary card). In registration trials in \nchildren, the primary end point was the reduction in the median duration of illness \n(defined based on temperature, cough, coryza and return to pre-illness health and \nactivity). A key secondary end point in children \u2013 time to resolution of all clinical \nsymptoms showed similar results. The primary endpoint in this study is the time to \nresolution (alleviation) of all symptoms. \nThe median of the primary end point in the active treatment groups (conventional and \nhigh dose) in this trial will be compared with the median of the time to resolution of \nsymptoms in the placebo group from the pivotal registration trials. The high dose arm \nenables the detection of a possible dose response relationship in this immune \ncompromised population. As a means to evaluate that possibility, an assessment of the \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 18 \nrelative efficacy of the two dose groups will be made in terms of median time to \nalleviation of symptoms. Section 8.2.5 provides details on the statistical considerations \nand their rationale associated with these comparisons. \nEffect of study design on efficacy end points \nThe main limitations of using the response to placebo from previous trials to estimate the \nresponse in this trial are due to the different populations (healthy versus \nimmunocompromised), age groups (adults versus adults and children) and the potential \ndifference in virulence of different strains. The potential difference in virulence of the \npredominant influenza viruses may be a confounder whose contribution can not be \nestimated. However the difference in populations and age groups is likely to result in the \nplacebo response from pivotal registration trials underestimating the time to alleviation in \nthe immunocompromised population. This is because the time to alleviation of symptoms \nis shorter in the healthy population compared to the immunocompromised population. \n[13] The placebo response in the pivotal trials will therefore underestimate the response \nin the current trial. The Sponsor is thus using a very conservative approach in comparing \nthe active treatment arms in this study with the response to placebo in healthy subjects. If \none/both of the treatment arms is statistically better than placebo, it is considered that this \nis a meaningful effect for this population.  If both treatment arms are not different from \nplacebo and this is seen consistently across several end points, it may be hypothesized \nthat the risk from influenza for the immunocompromised population treated with \noseltamivir is comparable to that for a healthy untreated adult with influenza.   \nPossible dosing recommendations based on current study \nHealthy subjects who were given placebo in the previous pivotal oseltamivir treatment \nstudies will be used as the control arm for this study.  When the two active treatment \narms are compared with this placebo control, several outcomes are possible. These \noutcomes will need to be discussed with health authorities.  Some outcomes and possible \ninterpretations of the results are presented below:   \n1. Conventional and high dose are both shown to be better than placebo: Both treatment \narms will be compared.  If no difference then the conventional dose would be the \ndose recommended for treatment in this population.  If a difference is seen between \ntreatment arms, then an evaluation (including benefit/risk assessment) will be made to \nconfirm whether the higher dose should be the recommended dose. \n2. One active treatment arm is superior to placebo while the other is not: In this instance \nthe dose that is shown to be superior will be recommended unless other \nconsiderations such as safety dictate otherwise.  \n3. Both conventional and high dose arms are not different from placebo: If this is seen \nconsistently across several secondary clinical end points, it may be hypothesized that \noseltamivir has reduced the risk in the immunocompromised population to the more \nacceptable level in the untreated healthy adult population. \n4. It is also possible that both conventional and high dose treatment have a more \nprotracted clinical course than the placebo arm. In this situation, it may be difficult to \nmake conclusions about efficacy.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 19 \nIrrespective of the efficacy outcomes, the study will still provide useful information of \nthe safety of oseltamivir in this population.  \nPossible recommendations for duration of treatment based on the current study \nOnce a dose is chosen a determination will need to be made on whether the \nrecommended duration of treatment should be 5 or 10 days or longer. This decision will \nbe based both on the clinical and virologic course of influenza.   \nThe recommended duration of treatment for influenza in healthy adults is five days. In \nthis study, the duration of dosing is ten days because viral shedding is typically longer in \nthe immunocompromised population than in healthy adults. The general standard of care \nfor this population has been to treat for as long as the patient continues to shed virus \n(even after the resolution of symptoms) [7] [9]. The duration of treatment for this \npopulation is therefore individualized based on clinical response and duration of viral \nshedding. It can often be more than 10 days. While it is possible that 10 or more days of \ntreatment may be needed [7] [9], it is also possible that 5 days of treatment may still be \nadequate. Therefore, in this study the clinical and virologic course (proportion shedding \nvirus at day 6 and later) will be evaluated to make recommendations on the duration of \ndosing. No statistical comparisons will be made.     \nStratification \nStratification in this study has no bearing on any comparisons with results from previous \ntrials. However, in order to evaluate a dose response relationship between the two active \ntreatment arms in this trial, stratification remains essential.  \nBecause HSCT recipients are at the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality from \ninfluenza, patients will be stratified by transplant type (SOT versus HSCT). Patients will \nbe stratified by time between onset of symptoms and treatment start (< 24 hours or \u2265 24 \nhours) because previous experience in otherwise healthy adults and children has shown \nthat patients treated early in their illness respond to treatment better than those who are \ntreated later. Patients will also be stratified by age ( \u2264 12 years and > 12 years) because \notherwise healthy children shed virus longer than otherwise healthy adults. It is expected \nthat a similar difference in the duration of viral shedding would exist between \nimmunocompromised children and adults. As vaccinated subjects may respond faster to \ntherapy, the study is also stratified based on influenza vaccination status for the current \nflu season (Yes; No). \nSection 3.1.2 Rationale for Dose Selection and Adjustment \nNew text: \nDose Adjustments \nIn this study, patients whose CrCl decreases to < 60mL/min/1.73M2 will be \ndiscontinued from treatment. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 20 \nOld text: \nDose Adjustments \nIn this study, dose adjustment for subjects with an estimated Cr Cl between 10 to 30 \nmL/min/1.73M2 will comprise decreasing the frequency of administration to once daily. \nThis is based on current label recommendations for adults with renal impairment \n(Table 1). \nTable 1 \nRecommended doses in healthy adults for treatment of influenza  \nCreatinine Clearance \nRecommended dose for treatment \n> 30 (ml/min) \n75 mg twice daily \n> 10 to \u2264 30 (ml/min) \n75 mg once daily or 30 mg suspension twice \ndaily \n\u226410 (ml/min)   \nNot recommended \ndialysis patients \nNot recommended \n \nThe dose adjustment recommendations are considered suitable approaches for children \nwith renal impairment.

The primary endpoint of \ndevelopment of resistance will be determined from the genotypic and phenotypic \nvariables measured post baseline and is described further in the Resistance Plan. \nOld text: \nThe primary endpoint in this study is the time to alleviation of all clinical influenza \nsymptoms (recorded in the patient diary). \nSection 8.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  \nNew text: \nThe following are secondary endpoints which measure efficacy, the primary of which \nis time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms.  With the exception of this variable, \nviral load and time to resolution of fever, they are defined as either the occurrence or \nnon-occurrence of the specified events or the presence or absence of the specified \nsymptoms. \nThe time (hours) to alleviation of all clinical influenza symptoms (recorded in \nthe patient diary) \nOld text: \nThe following are secondary endpoints.

Assuming that \n90% of enrolled patients will have laboratory-confirmed influenza, there will be 75 \npatients in each treatment arm in the population evaluable for the development of \nresistance.  The following table shows the 95% Pearson-Clopper confidence \nintervals that would result with a sample size of 75 patients in a treatment arm if \ncertain event rates are observed in the study. \nDuring the study the number of influenza A virus infected patients and the rate of \ndevelopment resistance will be monitored in a blinded fashion, in order to ensure a \nreasonable precision for the estimation.  An additional number of patients may be \nenrolled if necessary. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 34 \nObserved Rate (%) \n95% Confidence Interval \n0.0 \n  0%  - 4.8% \n1.3 \n0.0% - 7.2% \n2.7  \n0.3% - 9.3% \n5.3 \n1.5% - 13.1% \n10.7 \n4.7%-19.9% \n \nA total of 83 patients will be enrolled per arm and will be evaluable for the \nassessment of safety.  This number of patients would provide estimates of adverse \nevent rates with similar precision. \nOld text: \nSample size calculations were performed using a two-sided t-test and are based on the \ncomparison with a placebo control response in the pivotal registration trials in healthy \nadults of 112 hours for median time to alleviation of all symptoms. Assuming an \nexpected median time to alleviation of symptoms of 78 hours for each of the two active \ntreatment groups in this study, and a common standard deviation of 98 hours, then 111 \nevaluable subjects per group would give more than 90% power to detect a difference \nbetween the control and each of the active treatment groups. It is assumed that as many as \n90 % of subjects enrolled into the study who are identified as not being infected with \ninfluenza A H1N1 H274Y will have influenza, and therefore 124 such subjects per arm \nwould be required in order to obtain 111 influenza positive subjects. Note that this is an \napproximate calculation, as the final analysis will be based on the difference in medians \nand the corresponding 95% confidence interval from the Kaplan-Meier curves. This is \nhowever considered as a sufficient indication for the number of required subjects and the \npower that is expected. The maximum number of subjects enrolled in the trial will \ndepend upon the number of subjects identified with the oseltamivir resistant virus who \nwill be replaced. \nSection 8.2.4 Analysis Populations \nNew text: \nDetailed definitions of these populations will be given in the SAP. \nOld text: \nDetailed definitions of these populations will be given in the DRAM. \nSection 8.2.4.2 Intent to Treat Infected Population \nNew text: \nAll patients randomized and with laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, \nexcluding patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline, will be \nincluded in the intent to treat influenza infected population [Patients will be assigned to \ntreatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes]. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 35 \nThe ITTI Population will be the primary population for the summary and analysis of the \ndevelopment of resistance and the efficacy variables. \nOld text: \nAll patients randomized and with laboratory confirmation of influenza infection (positive \nviral cultures or 4 fold or greater rise in antibody titers), excluding patients infected with \noseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 H274Y at baseline, will be included in the intent \nto treat influenza infected population [Patients will be assigned to treatment groups as \nrandomized for analysis purposes]. \nThe ITTI Population will be the primary population for the summary and analysis of the \nprimary and secondary efficacy variables. \nSection 8.2.4.3 Subpopulations  \nNew text: \nA subpopulation of the ITTI population will be defined comprising patients who \nreceived their first dose of study medication within 48 hours of influenza symptom \nonset for the comparison of efficacy endpoints with the age appropriate placebo \ntreated patients (pediatric or adult) from the registration trials. \nOld text: \nNone.  Text added. \nSection 8.2.5 Efficacy Analysis \nNew text: \nFor the analysis of time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms, the following two \nassessments will be made independently of each other and without regard to the \noutcomes in each case. \n\u2022 Comparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials  \n \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment \napproval, a population of placebo treated patients will be established that is \ncomparable to the subpopulation of patients in the current study whose first dose \nof study medication was within 48 hours of symptom onset.  For this population, a \nmedian time to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms will be determined along \nwith its 95% confidence interval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.  These confidence intervals \nwill be compared individually to the placebo control confidence interval described \nabove as a potential means of establishing treatment effects. \n\u2022 Assessment of relative efficacy \n \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in \nthe median times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% \nconfidence interval.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 36 \nThis confidence interval will provide lower and upper limits for the treatment difference \nand can be used as the basis for potential inferences.  For example, if it does not contain \nthe value zero a difference will have been established.   \nFor the dichotomous endpoints, the proportion experiencing the event or symptom, and \nits associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment group.  Where \npossible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control population will \nbe presented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment groups in this trial. \nThe continuous secondary endpoint time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint.  \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load (log10TCID50/mL) at Day 1, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40, \nsummary statistics (including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and \nmaximum) will be derived for each treatment group. \nOld text: \nFor the primary analysis, the following two assessments will be made independently of \neach other and without regard to the outcomes in each case. \n\u2022 Comparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials \n \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment \napproval, a population of placebo treated patients will be established to match (in \nterms of efficacy evaluations, duration of observation etc.) those of the current study. \nFor this population, a median time to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms \nwill be determined along with its 95% confidence interval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.  These confidence intervals \nwill be compared individually to the placebo control confidence interval described \nabove as a potential means of establishing treatment effects. \n\u2022 Assessment of relative efficacy \n \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in \nthe median times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% \nconfidence interval. The methodology will be based on the use of the Hodges-\nLehmann estimator in the case of censored data.  \nThis confidence interval will provide lower and upper limits for the treatment difference \nand can be used as the basis for potential inferences. For example, if it does not contain \nthe value zero a difference will have been established. However, given the study sample \nsize this outcome is only likely if a clinically significant difference (e.g. 30% ) exists. \nAlthough this is not anticipated from the experience in pivotal registration trials in \nnormal healthy patients, it cannot be ruled out as a possibility in immunocompromised \ntransplant recipients.   \nFor the dichotomous secondary endpoints, the proportion experiencing the event or \nsymptom, and its associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C Amendment History (Ro 64-0796)   - Page 37 \ngroup.

The subjects will be \npositive for influenza by a rapid diagnostic test, PCR or virus \nculture at baseline. \nLENGTH OF STUDY  \n10 days of treatment, 30 days of follow up.   \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 2 \n \n \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL \nPRODUCT(S) \nDOSE/ ROUTE/ REGIMEN \nOseltamivir/placebo dry powder (to be reconstituted to a \nconcentration of 12 mg/ml) and 75 mg capsules.  The duration of \ndosing in both adults and children is 10 days. \n \nConventional dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup \n\u2264 15 kg   \n \n30 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg  \n \n45 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg  \n \n75 mg twice daily  \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years): Oseltamivir capsules \n75 mg twice daily \n \nSubjects randomized to the conventional dose will simultaneously \nreceive matching placebo so as to blind them and the investigator \nfrom the high dose arm.  \n \nHigh dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup  \n\u2264 15 kg   \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg  \n \n90 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg \n \n120 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg  \n \n150 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years):  Oseltamivir capsules  \n150 mg twice daily  \n \nDose adjustments:  In both treatment arms, patients whose CrCl \ndecreases to < 60ml/min/1.73M2 will discontinue study \nmedication. \nCOMPARATOR \u201cDRUG\u201d (or STANDARD \nOF CARE) DOSE/ ROUTE/ REGIMEN \nPlacebo (from pivotal registration trials in otherwise healthy \nadults) \nASSESSMENTS OF: \n \n- \nSAFETY \nAdverse events, physical exams, vital signs, clinical laboratory \nevaluations \n- \nRESISTANCE \nDevelopment of resistance \n- \nEFFICACY \nTime to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms as \nrecorded in the patient diary. \n \nPROCEDURES (summary): \nThe key procedures are: \nBlood draws for serum chemistry, hematology, and serology. \nNasal and throat swabs for viral culture and RT-PCR. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 3 \n \n \nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES: \nThe sample size has been chosen to provide an adequate number of patients to \nestimate the development of resistance with reasonable precision.  Assuming that \n90% of enrolled patients will have laboratory-confirmed influenza, there will be 75 \npatients in each treatment arm in the population evaluable for the development of \nresistance.  The following table shows the 95% Pearson-Clopper confidence \nintervals that would result with a sample size of 75 patients in a treatment arm if \ncertain event rates are observed in the study. \nDuring the study the number of influenza A virus infected patients and the rate of \ndevelopment of resistance will be monitored in a blinded fashion, in order to ensure \na reasonable precision for the estimation is maintained.  Additional patients may be \nenrolled if necessary. \nObserved Rate (%) \n95% Confidence Interval \n0.0 \n  0%  - 4.8% \n1.3 \n0.0% - 7.2% \n2.7  \n0.3% - 9.3% \n5.3 \n1.5% - 13.1% \n10.7 \n4.7%-19.9% \n \nA total of 83 patients will be enrolled per arm and will be evaluable for the \nassessment of safety.  This number of patients would provide estimates of adverse \nevent rates with similar precision. \nFor the primary objective of evaluating the safety of oseltamivir conventional and \nhigh dose treatments, AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs will be summarized and \ncompared with the known safety profile of the drug.  For the summary of the \ndevelopment of resistance for each treatment arm, 95% confidence intervals will be \nprovided with the estimated rates.   \nFor the secondary objective of evaluating the efficacy of oseltamivir as measured by \nthe time to resolution of influenza symptoms, the following two assessments will be \nmade independently of each other and without regard to the outcomes in each case. \n\u2022 Comparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials \n \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment \napproval, a population of placebo treated patients will be established that is \ncomparable to patients in the current study.  For this population, a median time \nto resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms will be determined along with its \n95% confidence interval. \n\u2022 Assessment of relative efficacy \n \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference \nin the median times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% \nconfidence interval.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 4 \nTable of Contents\n1.

Influenza virus types A and B cause \nan acute febrile infection of the respiratory tract characterized by the sudden onset of \nfever, malaise, headaches, myalgias and cough. Influenza causes numerous deaths each \nyear [1]. Although difficult to assess, annual influenza epidemics are thought to result in \nbetween three and five million cases of severe illness, and between 250,000 and 500,000 \ndeaths every year around the world [2]. \nThe influenza viruses are segmented, negative sense, single stranded, lipid encapsulated, \nRNA viruses between 80 and 100 nm in size. Subtypes are defined according to \nglycoproteins present in the viral lipid coat. The haemagglutinin complex (HA) is the \nmajor surface protein of the virus. The neuraminidase (NA) protein is the second major \nsurface protein in the virion and plays a role in enhancing virus penetration of the mucus \nlayer around the target cell and in release of virus from the cell surface. The matrix \nproteins, M1 and M2 appear to trigger the disintegration of the M1 complex during virus \nfusion with the cell and may also be involved in the maturation of the HA prior to \nassembly of new virus particles.  \n1.1.1 \nInfluenza in the Immunodeficient Population \nInfluenza infection is usually a self limiting condition. However, in children, the elderly \nand the immunocompromised, influenza infection can be associated with substantial \nmorbidity and mortality [1].  In patients with compromised immunity, influenza virus \nmay cause severe lower respiratory tract involvement; unusual syndromes, including \nencephalitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis and death [3].   \nConditions that compromise immunity may be classified based on etiology into \nprimary (genetic) and secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency.  Of the \nimmunodeficient conditions, the ones that affect cell mediated immunity are likely \nto have adverse outcomes following viral infections [20]. \nPrimary immunodeficiency  \nPrimary immunodeficiencies are relatively common, may be either congenital or \nmanifest later in life and are classified according to whether the genetic defect \naffects T or B cells or both [20].  There are four groups of disorders: severe \ncombined immunodeficiency (SCID), primary T cell deficiency (e.g. CD8 deficiency, \nDiGeorge syndrome), predominantly antibody deficiency (e.g. common variable \nimmunodeficiency, \nselective \nIgA \ndeficiency) \nand \nother \nwell-defined \nimmunodeficiency syndromes (e.g. Wiskott Aldrich syndrome) [20].  \nOf the primary immunodeficiencies, antibody deficiencies are the most frequent.  \nHowever, some of the more common antibody deficiency conditions (isolated IgA \ndeficiency, IgG subclass deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency) have \nintact cell-mediated immunity and therefore the clinical course of viral infections \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 13 \n(unless complicated by bacterial infections) does not differ significantly from that in \nthe normal host [20].  A list of primary immunodeficiency disorders at risk for viral \ninfections is provided in Appendix 6.  The incidence of some of these conditions has \nbeen estimated.  The incidence of SCID is 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 [20].  The \nmore severe forms of primary immunodeficiency are relatively rare, have their \nonset early in life, and all too frequently result in death during childhood [20].  \nSecondary Immunodeficiency \nSecondary immunodeficiencies are not caused by intrinsic abnormalities in \ndevelopment of T and B cells [20].  Secondary immunodeficiency may result from \ndiseases (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hematologic malignancy) or \nimmunosuppressive and cytotoxic drugs (such as those used for treatment of \ntransplant recipients, collagen vascular disease, malignancies).  \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to disease \nHIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ T cell count of < 200/\u00b5L are highly \nsusceptible \nto \nopportunistic \ndisease \n[20]. \n \nStudies \nin \nHIV/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) subjects have shown an increased risk for \nheart and lung-related hospitalizations during the influenza season compared to \nother times of the year, prolonged duration of influenza symptoms, increased risk \nfor influenza-related complications and a higher risk of influenza-related death [21]. \nSeveral hematologic malignancies affect the immune system (Appendix 7).  Several \nauthors have reported influenza in children and adults with hematologic \nmalignancies [22, 23, 24, 25].  \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to drugs (e.g. transplant recipients, collagen \nvascular disease, malignancies) \nThe enhanced survival of the transplant population following the availability of \nnewer immunosuppressive drugs has made them representative of the \nimmunocompromised population in general; and secondary immunodeficiency due \nto drugs, in particular. \nIn transplant recipients influenza is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary \ncomplications, extrapulmonary manifestations and an increased risk of graft dysfunction \nand high attributable mortality.  In a cohort study of influenza viral infection in solid \norgan transplant (SOT) subjects, 30 cases of influenza viral infection were identified.  \nSecondary bacterial pneumonia was seen in 17% of subjects and three SOT recipients (2 \nliver and one kidney) had myositis, myocarditis and bronchiolitis obliterans.  Biopsy of \nthe transplanted organ was performed in 21 of 30 cases and revealed variable degrees of \nacute allograft rejection in 62% of subjects.  The study concluded that influenza was \nassociated with significant morbidity in different groups of SOT recipients [5]. \nAmong transplant recipients, subjects with hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) \nare at the greatest risk for morbidity.  In a prospective study from the Infectious Diseases \nWorking Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 1973 \npatients were evaluated for respiratory virus infections after stem cell transplant.  The \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 14 \noverall mortality was 23% from influenza A infection and the direct influenza A-\nassociated mortality was 15.3% in this study [6].  A large retrospective study \n(4797 subjects undergoing HSCT over a 13-year period) identified 62 patients with \ninfluenza of whom as many as 29% (18 of 62 patients) developed pneumonia.  Ten \npercent of the subjects with influenza died [7].  \nThe increased morbidity in transplant patients is associated with increased duration of \nvirus shedding compared to that in healthy subjects. In otherwise healthy adults, elderly \nsubjects and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated subjects was 70, \n96 and 118 hours respectively [8].  In contrast, in the retrospective HSCT study, \ninfluenza virus was shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a \nmedian duration of 168 hours (7 days, range 2 to 37 days) [7]. \nCurrently available treatments for influenza infection are the M2 ion channel inhibitors \n(e.g. amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir, \nzanamivir).  \n1.1.2 \nOseltamivir \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Ro 64-0796) is an ethyl ester prodrug which is rapidly absorbed \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and metabolized in the liver by \nhigh capacity carboxylesterases to form oseltamivir carboxylate (Ro 64-0802), a potent, \nstable and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes.  The active \nform, oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted unchanged by the kidney via glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion by the organic anion transport system.  The efficacy \nand safety of oseltamivir in influenza treatment and prevention has been established in an \nextensive series of clinical studies in man. \nOseltamivir has been approved for the treatment of influenza in Europe, the United States \nand most other countries around the world. In adults and adolescents, the recommended \ndose is 75 mg twice daily for five days.  In children 1 year of age and older recommended \ndoses are 30, 45 or 60 mg bid based on body weight.  In all age groups the recommended \ndose is administered bid for 5 days.   \nThe approval of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza is based on several controlled \nclinical trials.  In the pooled population from these clinical trials encompassing adults \naged from 13-97 years, many with significant co-morbidity, 1325 subjects were treated \nwith oseltamivir (75 mg bid) and 1056 subjects received placebo.  A total of seven \ninfluenza symptoms (both respiratory and constitutional) were captured on the diary card \nfor adults.  The time to resolution of all symptoms (on the diary card) decreased by \n24 hours; from 124.5 hours in the placebo arm to 100.6 hours with oseltamivir 75 mg bid \n(p < 0.0001) [8].  Further, in adults and adolescents with a proven influenza illness, \noseltamivir treatment reduced overall antibiotic use for any reason by 26.7% and the \nincidence of influenza-related lower respiratory tract complications resulting in antibiotic \ntherapy by 55%.  The study concluded that oseltamivir treatment of influenza reduces \nlower respiratory tract complications, antibiotic use and hospitalizations in healthy and \n\u2018at risk\u2019 subjects [11].   \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 15 \nLikewise, in the influenza-infected pediatric population (1 to 12 years of age), oseltamivir \ntreatment (n = 217) was compared with placebo (n = 235).  There was a reduction  in  the \nmedian duration of illness (defined based on resolution of temperature, cough, coryza and \nreturn to pre-illness health and activity) of 36 hours; from 137 hours with placebo to 101 \nhours in the oseltamivir treatment arm (p=<0.0001).  The Canadian Acute Respiratory \nInfections Scale (CARIFS), validated for use in children, was used to collect symptom \ndata on the pediatric diary card.  The CARIFS scale comprised a total of 18 symptoms \nwhich were evaluated twice daily by the parent or guardian.  There was a similar \nreduction in the time to alleviation of all CARIFS symptoms of 36 hours; from 100 hours \nin the placebo group to 63 hours in the oseltamivir group (p < 0.0001) [12].  \nThus in both adults and children, the time to resolution of all symptoms was significantly \nreduced in the oseltamivir treatment arm compared with placebo.   \nOseltamivir was well-tolerated in clinical trials.  Approximately 11,000 subjects have \nreceived oseltamivir in the development program.  The most common adverse events \nreported by adults, the elderly, and children were nausea and vomiting.  Serious adverse \nevents (SAEs) were reported with a low and equal frequency by subjects taking active \ndrug and placebo.  Full details are given in the Investigator Brochure [8]. \nThe safety profile of oseltamivir has been well characterized for the prophylaxis \nindication in a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial conducted in the \nadult and pediatric immunocompromised (HSCT and SOT) population.  In the \noseltamivir group, the indications for transplant included hematologic malignancies \n(acute and chronic leukemias, multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome), \nlymphoid malignancies (Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphomas), primary \nimmunodeficiencies (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative \ndisease and severe combined immunodeficiency).  Other rare indications included \nbone marrow aplasia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelofibrosis and \nmultiple sclerosis.  In the safety population, there were 239 subjects randomized to \nthe conventional dose of oseltamivir and 238 to placebo.  The total number of \nadverse events reported in the placebo group (361 events) was generally similar to \nthat in the oseltamivir group (323 events).  Diarrhea was the most frequently \nreported adverse event (placebo, 8%; oseltamivir, 6%).  There were no deaths in the \noseltamivir group.  Oseltamivir was found to be safe in immunosuppressed \ntransplant recipients [26]. \nLimited safety and/or efficacy of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is available \nfrom several case reports in children and adolescents.  Oseltamivir was shown to be \nsafe and/or effective in HIV infected children (n=10) [27], children (age 3 to 12 \nyears) with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n=10) [25], in a nosocomial H1N1 \noutbreak in a pediatric (children aged 10 months to 13 years) oncology ward (n=8) \n[24], in children and adolescents (age 2 to 19 years) with malignancies (ALL, \nneuroblastoma, brain tumor, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing \nsarcoma, myelodysplasia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Wilms tumor, aplastic \nanemia, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia) \n(n=51) [22], in children aged 4 to 14 years on immunosuppressive drugs (n=5) [28] \nand in children (aged 5 months to 5 years) with bone marrow transplant (n=3) [29].  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 16 \nOseltamivir has also been shown to be safe and/or effective in mixed populations of \nchildren and adults (62 patients) with HSCT [7], and in a large epidemiologic study \n(n=221) with SOT [30].  \nFinally, \noseltamivir \nhas \nbeen \nshown \nto \nbe \nsafe \nand/or \neffective \nin \nimmunocompromised adults with HSCT [13] and adults with lung transplant [31, \n32, 33].  \nThe dose of oseltamivir was the same as the conventional dose in a majority of these \nreports.  In one report as many as 25 adult patients received twice the conventional \ndose [30] while in another report, three of nine adult patients received twice the \nconventional dose [33].  Treatment with oseltamivir generally ranged from 5 to 10 \ndays [32, 33, 30] and occasionally until the patient was symptom free [32, 33].  In \nexceptional cases treatment was given for as long as 20 days [22] or for as long as \nthe patient was positive by RT-PCR [25]. \nThere \nis \nsome \nconcern \nabout \nthe \ndevelopment \nof \nresistance \nin \nthe \nimmunocompromised population.  During the pandemic influenza season, more \nthan 23,000 clinical isolates of novel H1N1 pandemic virus were tested for resistance \nin the 6 international WHO regions.  A total of 225 isolates (from 225 subjects) were \nresistant (H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase coding sequence) to oseltamivir for \nan approximate incidence of 1%.  Information on immune status was available for \n142 of 225 patients.  Among the 142 patients, 56 (40%) were immunocompromised \n[34].  Prolonged viral replication and lack of immune-mediated virus clearance in \nimmunosuppressed patients treated with antivirals can result in a higher incidence \nof selection of drug-resistant viruses, a phenomenon that has been documented \npreviously [35, 36].  \n1.2 \nRationale for the Study  \nBecause of the increasing body of evidence (Section 1.1.2), oseltamivir is now \nrecommended in national guidelines as an option for the treatment of influenza in \nthe transplant population [40].  As the transplant population is considered \nrepresentative of the immunocompromised population, the primary objective of this \nstudy is to evaluate safety and resistance, while evaluating efficacy as a secondary \nobjective. \n2. \nOBJECTIVES  \n2.1 \nPrimary Objective \nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate prospectively the safety and \ntolerability of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised \npatients and characterize the effects of oseltamivir in immunocompromised patients \non the development of resistant influenza virus. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 17 \n2.2 \nSecondary Objectives   \nThe secondary objectives of the study are:  \nTo \nevaluate \nthe \neffects \nof \nconventional \nand \nhigh \ndose \noseltamivir \nin \nimmunocompromised patients on: \n\u2022 The time to resolution of influenza symptoms. \n\u2022 The clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis).  \n\u2022 The virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntime points). \n \n3. \nSTUDY DESIGN \n3.1 \nOverview of Study Design and Dosing Regimen   \nThis is a double blind, randomized, stratified, multi-center trial of conventional and high \ndose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients.  \nImmunocompromised patients who develop an influenza-like illness with a positive \nrapid diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture for influenza, will be enrolled during the \ninfluenza season.  Patients will be stratified by transplant status [yes, no], the time \nbetween onset of influenza symptoms and treatment start (up to 96 hours) [\u2264 48 hours; \n> 48 hours], influenza vaccination status for current influenza season [Yes; No] and by \nage [\u2264 12 years; > 12 years].  Eligible patients will be consented and randomized to \nreceive oseltamivir twice daily for 10 days in one of two treatment arms: conventional \ndose or high dose (double the conventional dose).  \n3.1.1 \nRationale for Study Design \nThis study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo controlled \ntrials.  \nThere is no placebo control arm in this study as it was considered unethical for this \nhigh risk population.  The development of resistance following treatment with \noseltamivir (one of the primary objectives of the study) is an objective assessment \n(determined by laboratory tests) and is unlikely to be impacted by the absence of a \nplacebo arm.  \nAs a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this population, an alternative \ncontrol arm had to be identified for efficacy end points.  The response to placebo in \npivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was \nchosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial.  In order to do this, the \nend points were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal registration trials.  \nThe following sections provide rationale and justification for specific aspects of the study \ndesign which differ from the currently approved dosing for influenza or from \nprevious pivotal registration trials.  They also provide information on how the results \nwill be used to make recommendations on dose and duration of treatment. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 18 \n3.1.1.1 \nChoice of Treatment Arms \nThe currently approved dose of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is the \nconventional dose with a duration of five days.  In this study a conventional and \nhigh dose (twice the conventional dose) are being evaluated.  The pivotal registration \ntrials for oseltamivir in healthy adults with influenza had three treatment arms, two active \n(75 mg and 150 mg) and one placebo.  Both treatment arms were found to be \nsignificantly better than placebo.  No statistical comparisons were made between the two \nactive treatment arms.  Evaluation of the results in the two active treatment arms did not \nreveal any clinically meaningful difference.  However, the proportion of subjects \nshedding virus on day 4 (3 days after the start of treatment), suggested a possible \ndose response relationship (36%, 28% and 23% in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg \ndose arms respectively).  Because defective immune-mediated virus clearance in \nimmunosuppressed patients treated with antivirals can result in a higher incidence \nof selection of drug-resistant viruses, it was decided to use both the conventional and \nhigh dose arm for this study.  A longer duration of treatment was chosen because a \nlarge retrospective study has shown that the median duration of viral shedding of \n7 days [7] was greater for HSCT recipients than that seen in the healthy children, \nadult and elderly population with influenza (Section 1.1.1) [8].  \n3.1.1.2 \nInclusion of Patients Symptomatic up to 96 Hours \nIn immunocompromised patients, time from onset of symptoms to seeking medical \nattention (presentation at the clinic) of > 48 hours has been shown in several case \nreports [37, 31, 32, 33] including two instances of nosocomial outbreaks in children \n[29, 24].  This notwithstanding, oseltamivir has been shown to be effective in \nimmunocompromised populations that included patients treated with oseltamivir \nbeyond 48 hours of presentation; patients with lung transplant (median time to \npresentation 3 days) [31], bone marrow transplant (treatment started more than \n48 hours after onset of symptoms in all three patients) [29], organ transplant (62 out \nof 221 patients started treatment after 96 hours) [30] and children with ALL (one \nchild presented after 3 days and two children after 5 days of symptoms) [25]. \nIn a prospective, observational study involving adults hospitalized with influenza, \nthe study authors concluded that \u2018Weakened host defenses slow viral clearance, \nwhereas antivirals started within the first four days of illness enhance viral \nclearance\u2019 [38].  \nAdditionally, in November 2009, in a communication for clinicians on antiviral \ntreatments for H1N1, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nstated that while antiviral treatment is most effective when started early; both \noutpatients with risk factors and hospitalized patients still benefit when treatment \nwith oseltamivir is started more than 48 hours after illness onset [39].   \n3.1.1.3 \nInterpretation of Study Results  \nSafety and tolerability and the development of resistance are the primary objectives \nof this study.  These will be characterized descriptively.  For the secondary objective \nof efficacy, the subset of the population enrolled in the first 48 hours will be \ncompared with placebo patients from pivotal registration trials (where patients were \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 19 \nenrolled in the first two days of illness).  Sections 8.2.5, 8.2.6, and 8.2.7 provide \ndetails on the statistical considerations and their rationale associated with these \ncomparisons. \nStratification \nStratification in this study has no bearing on any comparisons with results from previous \ntrials.  However, in order to evaluate a dose response relationship between the two active \ntreatment arms in this trial, stratification remains essential.  \nPatients will be stratified by transplant status (yes, no) because transplant patients \nform a relatively large homogenous group in this study and might influence \noutcome.  \nPatients will be stratified by time between onset of symptoms and treatment start \n(< 48 hours or \u2265 48 hours) because previous experience in otherwise healthy adults and \nchildren has shown that patients treated early in their illness respond to treatment better \nthan those who are treated later.  Patients will also be stratified by age (\u2264 12 years and \n> 12 years) because otherwise healthy children shed virus longer than otherwise healthy \nadults.  It is expected that a similar difference in the duration of viral shedding would \nexist between immunocompromised children and adults.  As vaccinated subjects may \nrespond faster to therapy, the study is also stratified based on influenza vaccination status \nfor the current influenza season (Yes; No).  \n3.1.2 \nRationale for Dose Selection and Adjustment \nDose Selection \nThe dose of oseltamivir to be used in this study is the conventional, approved dose for \nchildren and adults in the treatment of influenza.  There will be a second higher dose for \ncomparison which is two times the conventional dose.  This higher dose is used based on \ntheoretical considerations which suggest that the higher dose may be associated with \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance.  \nThe anticipated pro-drug and metabolite exposures from this higher dose are not expected \nto exceed maximum exposures seen previously in the oseltamivir development program.  \nThe safety and tolerability of the higher dose regimen has already been demonstrated in \ntreatment studies of immunocompetent adult subjects (n = 447) [14].  In a study to \ndemonstrate cardiac safety, in the highest dose group treated with 450 mg b.i.d. for \n5 days [n = 99], no subject had a serious adverse event, nor withdrew prematurely.  In \nPhase I studies in adults, oseltamivir has been administered in multiple doses of up to \n500 mg b.i.d.  Doses of 200 mg b.i.d. and greater have been associated with increased \ngastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) [8].  In adult subjects with \ncreatinine clearances of \u2264 30 mL/min, doses of 100 mg b.i.d. for 6 days were well \ntolerated, despite steady-state oseltamivir carboxylate exposures approximately 10-fold \nhigher than those achieved with standard dosing in renally competent individuals [15].  \nNo other adverse effects were reported more frequently with higher doses and no serious \nadverse events have been reported within the volunteer studies.  Co-administration of \noseltamivir with food has been demonstrated to substantially reduce the frequency and \nseverity of gastrointestinal side effects.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 20 \nThus, the rationale for the higher dose arm in this study is to explore the possibility of \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance without an undue increase in \nrisk.  \nDrug interactions with immunosuppressive medications have also been evaluated.  The \npharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate after administration of \n75 mg oseltamivir (conventional adult dose) in subjects with a well-functioning, stable \nrenal allograft who were being maintained on immunosuppressive therapy were studied.  \nThese were similar to those described in the literature for adults with comparable degrees \nof renal function.  Oseltamivir was well tolerated and had no clinically relevant effect on \nthe steady-state pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate \nmofetil [8]. \nDuration of Dosing \nThe duration of dosing chosen for this population (10 days) is longer than that in the \nhealthy adult and pediatric populations (5 days).  This is based on observations that the \nviral shedding and illness are typically longer in immunocompromised patients than it is \nin healthy adults [7, 13]. \nDose Adjustments \nIn this study, patients whose CrCl decreases to < 60mL/min/1.73M2 will be \ndiscontinued from treatment. \n3.1.3 \nEnd of Study \nThe study comprises 10 days of treatment with follow up visits approximately 5 and 30 \ndays later as shown in the schedule of assessments.  A rapid diagnostic test for influenza \nwill be performed at the end of the 10 days of treatment.  Subjects still having influenza \nbased on the rapid diagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care by the \nprincipal investigator.  \n3.2 \nNumber of Subjects/ Assignment to Treatment Groups \nA minimum of 166 patients (approximately 83 per arm) to allow an adequate number \nof influenza A patients, including 50 transplant recipients will be enrolled in this \nstudy.  After screening, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two active \ntreatment groups. \n3.3 \nCenters \nThis will be a multicenter study with approximately 100-110 centers in the Northern \nhemisphere.  \n4. \nSTUDY POPULATION \n4.1 \nOverview \nThe study population comprises immunocompromised adults (including adolescents) and \nchildren who have influenza.  Additionally, the subjects must not have other medical \nconditions that will preclude the assessment of efficacy or safety.

Change of therapy is defined as dose increase or change of \nmedication prior to onset of present influenza like illness. \n\u2022 Patients with gastrointestinal disorders which might interfere with their ability to \nabsorb oral medication.  \n\u2022 Allergy to the test medication. \n\u2022 Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (for subjects who will be taking the \nliquid formulation). \n\u2022 Influenza vaccination with live attenuated vaccine in the 2 weeks prior to \nrandomization. \n\u2022 Antiviral treatment (example: amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir, laninamivir, \nperamivir, zanamivir and ribavirin) for influenza in the 2 weeks prior to \nrandomization. \n\u2022 Patients taking probenecid medication. \n\u2022 Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.   \n\u2022 Participation in a clinical trial or expanded access trial with an investigational drug in \nthe 4 weeks prior to randomization or concomitantly with this study.   \n \n4.4 \nConcomitant Medication and Treatment \nAntiviral treatments with activity against influenza (e.g. amantadine, rimantadine, \nzanamivir, ribavirin, laninamivir, peramivir, and additional oseltamivir above that \nspecified for this study) are not allowed during the 10-day treatment phase of the study.  \nConcomitant use of an investigational drug during the study is also excluded.  Live \nattenuated vaccines may not be advisable for this population. It is possible that concurrent \nuse with oseltamivir may render live vaccines ineffective.  \nMedications required for the routine care of the patient may be continued during the \nstudy.  Concomitant use of probenecid (irrespective of the indication) is not allowed \nduring the study. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 23 \n4.5 \nCriteria for Premature Withdrawal  \nThe investigator must discontinue treatment if the creatinine clearance is < 60 ml/min in \nadults or < 60 ml/min/1.73 M2 in children.  The investigator must also discontinue \ntreatment from all subjects with intercurrent illnesses or adverse events suggestive of \nhepatic decompensation.  The investigator also has the right to discontinue treatment in \nthe event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, treatment failure, protocol violations, \nadministrative reasons or other reasons. \nThe investigator must discontinue treatment with study drug if the patient is to be treated \nconcomitantly with another antiviral for influenza, for example, amantadine, rimantadine, \nlaninamivir, peramivir, or zanamavir.  However, all patients, including those who \ndiscontinue study drug prematurely and/or are treated with another antiviral, will be \nrequired to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose of study \nmedication (day 15 and day 40 assessments). \nSubjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  \nAn excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, \nunnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  Should a subject decide to \nwithdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations prior to \nwithdrawal as thoroughly as possible. \nThe investigator should contact the subject or a responsible relative either by telephone or \nthrough a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the \nwithdrawal.  A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient\u2019s withdrawal should be \nmade with an explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study.  If the reason \nfor removal of a subject from the study is an Adverse Event, the principal specific event \nwill be recorded on the CRF. \nIn the case that the subject decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment [\u201crefuses \ntreatment\u201d], he/she should be asked if he/she can still be contacted for further \ninformation.  The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical \nrecords and in the CRF.  \n4.6 \nReplacement Policy [Ensuring Adequate Numbers of \nEvaluable Subjects] \n4.6.1 \nFor Subjects \nNo subject prematurely discontinued from the study for any reason will be replaced. \n4.6.2 \nFor Centers \nA center may be replaced for the following administrative reasons:   \n\u2013 Excessively slow recruitment. \n\u2013 Poor protocol adherence. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 24 \n5. \nSCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES \nTable 1 \nSchedule of Assessments \n \nBaseline \nTreatment \nFollow-up \nStudy Day \n1 (pre-\ndose) \n1 \n2 or 3f,g \n6 g \n8 f, g \n11g, h, i \n15g   \n40 g, j \nInformed Consent/Assent \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMedical history  \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDemographics \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHeight and weight \nx \n \n \n \n \nx \n \n \nPregnancy Test a \nx \n \n \n \n \nx \n \nx \nRapid diagnostic test for \ninfluenza virus shedding  \nx \n \n \n \n \n \nx \n \n \nSafety Labs b \nx \n \n \n \n \nx \n \n \nPhysical Examination \nx \n \n \n \n \nx \n \nx \nVital Signs (including PR, RR, \ntemperature, Blood pressure) \nx \n \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nNasal and throat swabs for viral \nshedding and viral load c, d \nx \n \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nReview of electronic diary data e    \n \n \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nx \nDrug Administration \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCollection of unused study \nmedication and empty containers \n \n \n \n \n \nx \n \n \nPrevious Diseases  \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrevious/Concomitant \nmedications \nx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdverse Events/Sec Illnesses and \nTreatments \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRejection, Graft versus host \ndisease (GVHD) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na  Urine pregnancy test for patients of child-bearing potential according to the judgment/discretion of the \ninvestigator. \nb  Hematology (CBC with differential) and chemistry (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea, Cr).

They will be required to come for their follow-up visits on day 15 and \nday 40.  \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 25 \nTable 1 \nSchedule of Assessments (Cont.) \ni  Subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely will have an end of treatment (day 11) assessment at \nthe time of treatment discontinuation or the following day. They will be required to attend their follow \nup visits approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose (day 15 and day 40 assessments).  \nj  Subjects who discontinue during follow-up will have an end of follow-up (day 40) assessment. This \nvisit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.   \n \n5.1 \nScreening Examination and Eligibility Screening Form  \nAll subjects must provide written informed consent (assent where applicable) before any \nstudy specific assessments or procedures are performed. Screening will take place at the \nbaseline visit prior to first dose.  However, if necessary, screening may take place the day \nbefore the baseline visit, as long as the patient is randomized and receives his/her first \ndose of study medication within 96 hours of influenza symptom onset. \nSubjects will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria and those who fulfill all the \ninclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study.  \nAn Eligibility Screening Form [ESF] documenting the investigator\u2019s assessment of each \nscreened subject with regard to the protocol\u2019s inclusion and exclusion criteria is to be \ncompleted by the investigator. \nA screen failure log must be maintained by the investigator.  \n5.2 \nProcedures for Enrollment of Eligible Subjects  \nOnce a subject has fulfilled the entry criteria, he/she will be randomized to one of two \ntreatment groups. The subject randomization numbers will be generated by Roche or its \ndesignee and incorporated into double-blind labeling. \nThe investigator or designee will use the CRF pre-printed with the assigned subject \nnumber and enter the randomization number provided by IVRS for allocation to the \ntreatment groups in the appropriate place on each subject\u2019s CRF. \nRandomization will be stratified by transplant status (Yes; No); time between onset of \nsymptoms and treatment start (\u2264 48 hrs or > 48 hrs), influenza vaccination status (Yes; \nNo) and patient\u2019s age (\u2264 12 years or > 12 years).  \n5.3 \nClinical Assessments and Procedures \nAt all visits subjects will receive the routine care for their primary illness.  Routine \npatient care (including the adjustment of doses of any of the immunosuppressive drugs) \nwill be dictated by tests performed locally at the trial site.  All safety labs will be sent to a \ncentral laboratory.  Results for these laboratory parameters will be used by the \nsponsor/designee to assess overall safety. \nAll assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of \nAssessments (Table 1).  Additional information regarding these procedures not provided \nin the Schedule of Assessments is provided below. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 26 \nStudy Day 1 \nThe baseline and study day 1 assessment may be performed at the same visit. \nStudy medication, electronic diaries, and thermometers will be dispensed.  Patients or \nguardians/parents will be instructed how to complete electronic symptom diaries \n(Appendix 2) (Appendix 3), temperature recording, and treatment administration details, \nincluding time of each oseltamivir dose.  The first diary entries will be made at the site \nbefore the first dose of study drug.  \nBaseline nasal and throat swab samples will be assessed for the presence of oseltamivir-\nresistance mutations.   \nThe date of the first dose of study drug is defined as study day 1.  Once randomized, the \nfirst dose of study drug will be administered in the clinic. Study day 2 will begin at 12 \nmidnight of the same calendar day.  If the first dose of study drug is taken after 4 pm on \nday 1, the next dose of study drug will be taken in the morning of day 2.  In this case, the \nlast dose of study drug will be taken on the morning of study day 11.   \nIf the first dose of study drug is taken prior to 4 pm on day 1, the next dose of study drug \nshould be taken in the evening of the same day (i.e. prior to midnight on the same \ncalendar day with a minimum of 7 hours between doses).  For these patients the last dose \nof study drug will be taken in the evening of study day 10. More information on dosing is \nprovided later (Section 6.1). \nStudy Days 2 - 11 \nStudy day 2 will begin at 12 midnight of study day 1.  \nIt is expected the study staff will maintain close contact with patients, especially during \nthe first few days of the study.  The study staff should inquire about any adverse events, \ncheck that the patient or parent/guardian is entering data into the electronic diary \nproperly, and assess drug compliance.  During the dosing period, diary symptoms should \nbe assessed and temperature should be recorded at the same time that the study drug is \ntaken.  \nEnd of Treatment Day 11 \nThe end of treatment visit for all subjects is on day 11 (irrespective of whether they took \none or two doses on day 1).  Subjects who discontinue study medication prematurely will \nhave all day 11 assessments completed at the time of discontinuation or the following \nday.  \nAfter all day 11 study assessments are completed, a rapid diagnostic test will be \nperformed at this visit.  If the rapid diagnostic test is positive, the subject may be treated \nper standard of care at the discretion of the investigator.  \nAll subjects (including those who discontinue study medication prematurely and those \nwho are positive for influenza on their rapid diagnostic test at the end of treatment visit) \nwill be required to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose \n(day 15 and day 40 assessments).    \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 27 \nStudy Days 12 \u2013 40 \nStudy day 15 is an important visit as it is the first assessment of viral culture after \ncessation of treatment.  \nEnd of Follow-Up Day 40  \nAll subjects must attend an end of follow-up visit on day 40.  \nIf the patient is withdrawn after completion of treatment (after the day 11 assessment), a \ntermination visit should be arranged.  This visit should be the end of follow-up visit \nassessment [Day 40].  This visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.  \nPatients or parents/guardians who do not return to the clinic will be contacted by \ntelephone to ascertain their health status, or that of their child\u2019s, record information on \nadverse events, and to ask that they return the electronic diary. \n5.3.1 \nEfficacy Assessments \nThe primary efficacy end point in this study is the time to resolution of all influenza \nsymptoms as recorded in the patient diary.  \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \n1. Symptoms of influenza-like illness.  These are captured in the diary for both adults \nand children (Appendix 2) (Appendix 3).  Influenza symptoms are graded on a \nnominal scale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem).  A score \nof zero is considered asymptomatic.  The primary efficacy end point, time to \nalleviation of all symptoms is comprised of all the symptoms captured in the diary.  \n2. Temperature.  This is captured in the diary.  Temperature is used for assessment of \nthe primary and several secondary efficacy end points.  \n \n5.3.2 \nSafety \nSafety parameters in this study include adverse events, vital signs, and clinical laboratory \nevaluations.  \nPre-defined symptoms of influenza captured in the adult and pediatric diaries are not to \nbe reported as adverse events unless they can be further qualified.  Thus \u2018headache due to \nstress at work\u2019 is reported as an adverse event.  However, unexplained \u2018headache\u2019 is \nconsidered a predefined symptom related to influenza and not an adverse event.  \nAdverse events such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis are considered \nsecondary illnesses of influenza and should be recorded as adverse events. \nOther adverse events to be expected in the transplant population such as rejection and \ngraft versus host disease (in HSCT subjects) will also be collected as adverse events.  \n5.4 \nLaboratory Assessments \nThe laboratory assessments include those for efficacy and safety. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 28 \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza. \nThese are: \nNasal and throat swabs.  Two nasal and one throat swab will be collected as described in \nthe Schedule of Assessments.  All swabs are sent to a central laboratory for RT-PCR and \nviral cultures.  Influenza virus shedding will be assessed.  Baseline samples will be \nassessed for the presence of oseltamivir-resistance mutations.   \nDuring the course of treatment, neither the investigator nor the patient will know which \nparticipants have ongoing positive viral cultures for influenza.  At the end of treatment \n(day 11), a rapid diagnostic test is permitted for the diagnosis of ongoing influenza.  \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum \nchemistry and hematology will be done at the central laboratory.  Serum chemistry \nassessments comprise AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea and creatinine.  Hematology \nassessments include CBC and differential count.  The total volume of blood loss for \nlaboratory assessments will be approximately 20 mL for the entire duration of the study.  \nProtection of patient confidentiality (Section 16) will extend to any data generated from \nthe assaying of these samples.  Biological samples taken from all patients may be \ninfectious and will be classified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nThe Principal Investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be assessed at the local \nlaboratory when clinically indicated during the study to calculate creatinine clearance. \n6. \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \nThe Investigational Medical Product in this study is oseltamivir dry powder (to be \nreconstituted to a concentration of 12 mg/ml) or 75 mg capsules and matching placebo. \nThe Investigational Medicinal Products will be supplied, packaged individually for each \nsubject and labeled in accordance with Roche Standard and local regulation by Roche \nClinical Trial Supply, Basel, Switzerland.  \n6.1 \nDose and Schedule of Study Drug \nOseltamivir will be given twice daily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.  The doses \nneed to be taken at 12 hourly intervals.  Under no circumstances is a subject allowed to \ntake two doses within 7 hours of each other.  \nPatients will be randomized to receive either conventional or high dose of study drug. \nConventional dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup \n\u2264 15 kg  \n \n \n30 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg   \n \n45 mg twice daily \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 29 \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg  \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg \n \n \n75 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years): Oseltamivir capsules  \n75 mg twice daily \nSubjects randomized to the conventional dose will simultaneously receive matching \nplacebo so as to blind them and the investigator from the high dose arm.  \nHigh dose: \nChildren ages 1 - 12 years: Oseltamivir syrup  \n\u2264 15 kg  \n \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 15 \u2013 23 kg   \n \n90 mg twice daily \n> 23 \u2013 40 kg  \n \n120 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg \n \n \n150 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years): Oseltamivir capsules  \n150 mg twice daily  \n6.1.1 \nDose Modifications \nNo dose modifications will be allowed on study. \n6.2 \nPreparation and Administration of Study Drug \nOseltamivir will be provided in two forms:  \n1. Capsules containing 75 mg of active drug and packaging material consisting of \npregelatinized starch, povidone, talc and sodium stearyl fumarate.  All participants 13 \nyears and older will receive this dosage form.  Oseltamivir capsules should be stored \nat 25\u00baC.  \n2. A pediatric suspension containing 12 mg oseltamivir per ml of reconstituted solution \nand the following excipients: sorbitol, titanium dioxide, sodium benzoate, xanthan \ngum, monosodium citrate, saccharin sodium and Permaseal11900-31 Tutti Frutti \n(flavor).  All participants 12 years and under will receive this dosage form.  \nOseltamivir dry powder for suspension [pediatric syrup] should be stored at 25\u00baC.  \nAfter reconstitution, the suspension should not be used for longer than 10 days.  Store \nconstituted suspension under refrigeration at 2\u00ba to 8\u00baC.  Do not freeze. \n \nMatching placebo will be available as capsules and suspension.  Subjects in the \nconventional dose arm will get the conventional dose and matching placebo so that they \nare blinded from the high dose arm.  \nEach subject will be dispensed a medication pack that will provide enough medication to \ncover 20 doses.  For subjects randomized to the conventional dose arm, the medication \npack will contain a bottle of oseltamivir dry powder or a blister wallet with oseltamivir \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 30 \ncapsules and matching placebo.  For subjects randomized to the high dose arm, the \nmedication pack will contain two bottles of oseltamivir dry powder or two blister wallets \nwith oseltamivir capsules.  Irrespective of the treatment group the subject is randomized \nto, for each dose the subject will take the same amount from both bottles or blister wallets \nprovided in the medication pack such that the sum of the amounts from each immediate \ncontainer constitutes one dose. \nOne dose is to be administered twice per day at approximately 12-hour intervals with a \nlight snack or glass of milk or fruit juice.  The first dose of study medication will be \nadministered in the clinic at the time of randomization. \n6.3 \nBlinding and Unblinding \nRandomization will be administered by a central randomization center.  \nThe Randomization List will not be available at the study center, to the study monitors, \nproject statisticians or to the project team at Roche.  Emergency codes, or another \nadequate method of unblinding, will be implemented before study start, if the identity of \nthe test medication is necessary for patient management in the case of a serious adverse \nevent.  Emergency codes should not be broken except in the case of emergency \nsituations.  Any request from the investigator for information about the treatment \nadministered to study subjects for another purpose must be discussed with \nRoche/designee.  \nAs per regulatory reporting requirement, Roche/designee will unblind the identity of the \nstudy medication for all unexpected [as per IB] serious adverse events that are considered \nby the investigator to be related to study drug.  Details of patients who are unblinded \nduring the study will be included in the Clinical Study Report. \nAll other individuals directly involved in this study will remain blinded until the final \nanalysis of the primary parameter.  \nThe randomization will be stratified by transplant status, duration of symptoms, \ninfluenza vaccination status and age and will be provided by the Roche randomization \ngroup for the IVRS vendor.   \n6.4 \nAssessment of Compliance \nAccountability and subject compliance will be assessed by maintaining adequate \u201cdrug \ndispensing\u201d and return records.  \nSubjects will be asked to return all used and unused drug supply containers at the end of \nthe treatment as a measure of compliance.  \nA Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should contain the following \ninformation: \n\u2022 the identification of the subject [randomization and medication numbers] to whom the \nstudy medication was dispensed \n\u2022 the date[s], quantity of the study medication dispensed to the subject \n\u2022 the date[s] and quantity of the study medication returned by the subject \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 31 \nThis inventory must be available for inspection by the Monitor. All supplies, including \npartially used or empty containers and the dispensing logs, must be returned to the \nmonitor at the end of the study. \n6.5 \nDestruction of Study Drug \nLocal or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used \ninvestigational product for safety reasons.  In these cases, it may be acceptable for \ninvestigational site staff to destroy dispensed investigational product before a monitoring \ninspection provided that source document verification is performed on the remaining \ninventory and reconciled against the documentation of quantity shipped, dispensed, \nreturned and destroyed.  Written authorization must be obtained from the sponsor or \ndesignee at study start up before destruction. \nWritten documentation of destruction must contain the following: \n\u2013 Identity [batch numbers or subject numbers] of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 Quantity of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 Date of destruction \n\u2013 Method of destruction \n\u2013 Name and signature of responsible person [or company] who destroyed \ninvestigational products[s] \n7. \nSAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE \n7.1 \nAdverse Events (AEs) and Laboratory Abnormalities \n7.1.1 \nClinical AEs \nPer the International Conference of Harmonization [ICH], an AE is any untoward \nmedical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a \npharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with \nthis treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign [including \nan abnormal laboratory finding], symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use \nof a medicinal [investigational] product, whether or not considered related to the \nmedicinal [investigational] product.  Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study \nare to be reported as AEs.  Influenza signs and symptoms reported on the patient diary \nwill be summarized as efficacy end points and need not be captured as adverse events.  \nHowever, secondary illnesses due to influenza must be reported as adverse events.  \n7.1.1.1 \nIntensity  \nAll clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of \nthe CRF.   \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 32 \nIntensity of AEs will be graded on a four -point scale [mild, moderate, severe, \nlife-threatening] and reported in detail on the CRF.   \nMild \ndiscomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. \nModerate \ndiscomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity. \nSevere \ninability to work or perform normal daily activity \nLife Threatening \nrepresents an immediate threat to life   \n7.1.1.2 \nDrug - Adverse Event Relationship \nRelationship of the AE to the treatment should always be assessed by the investigator.  \nDescription of scales can be found in Appendix 4. \n7.1.1.3 \nSerious Adverse Events [Immediately Reportable to Roche] \nA Serious Adverse Event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect or precaution.  It is any AE that at any dose fulfils at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 is fatal; [results in death; NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event].  \n\u2013 is Life-Threatening [NOTE: the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to \nan event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe]. \n\u2013 required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \nThe full requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to \n(Appendix 5). \n7.1.2 \nTreatment and Follow-up of AEs  \nAEs, especially those for which the relationship to test \u201cdrug\u201d is not \u201cunrelated\u201d, should \nbe followed up until they have returned to baseline status or stabilized.  If a clear \nexplanation is established it should be recorded on the CRF.   \n7.1.3 \nLaboratory Test Abnormalities \nLaboratory test results will appear printed on laboratory reports provided to the site from \nthe central laboratory.  \nAny laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event [SAE] \nshould be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the CRF. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 33 \nAny treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result which is clinically significant, \ni.e., meeting one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded as a single \ndiagnosis on the AE page in the CRF: \n\u2022 Accompanied by clinical symptoms. \n\u2022 Leading to a change in study medication [e.g. dose modification, interruption or \npermanent discontinuation]. \n\u2022 Requiring a change in concomitant therapy [e.g. addition of, interruption of, \ndiscontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or \ntreatment]. \n \n7.1.4 \nFollow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values \nIn the event of medically significant unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the \ntests should be repeated and followed up until they have returned to the normal range \nand/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  If a clear explanation is \nestablished it should be recorded on the CRF.  \n7.2 \nHandling of Safety Parameters \n7.2.1 \nReporting of Serious Adverse Events [immediately reportable] \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious [as defined in \nSection 7.1.1.3 above] and which occurs during the course of the study, regardless of \nthe treatment arm, occurring from the enrollment visit (start of study screening \nprocedures), must be reported to Roche or designee within one working day of the \ninvestigator becoming aware of the event [expedited reporting]. \nRelated Serious Adverse Events MUST be collected and reported regardless of the time \nelapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  \nUnrelated Serious Adverse Events must be collected and reported during the study and up \nuntil the follow-up visit.  \nThe definition and reporting requirements of ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data \nManagement, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be \nadhered to (Appendix 5). \n7.2.2 \nPregnancy  \nA female subject must be instructed to stop taking the test \u201cdrug\u201d and immediately \ninform the investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.  The investigator \nshould report all pregnancies within 24 hours to the sponsor or designee.  The \ninvestigator should counsel the subject, and discuss the risks of continuing with the \npregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should \ncontinue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Pregnancies occurring within 28 days of \ntreatment completion should be reported to Roche.  \n7.3 \nWarnings and Precautions  \nEvents such as convulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of \nconsciousness, confusion, abnormal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 34 \nanxiety, nightmares) have been reported during oseltamivir use in patients with influenza, \npredominately in children and adolescents.  In rare cases, these events resulted in \naccidental injury.  The contribution of oseltamivir to those events is unknown.  Such \nevents have also been reported in patients with influenza who were not taking \noseltamivir.  Patients, especially children and adolescents, should be closely monitored \nfor signs of abnormal behavior. \nPlease refer to the attached Investigator\u2019s Brochure for additional warnings, precautions, \nand other reported adverse events. \n8. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN   \nFull details of all planned analyses will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis \nPlan (SAP) for the safety and efficacy variables and in the Resistance Plan for the \ndevelopment of resistance.  The methods described below are an outline of the main \nplanned analyses. \n8.1 \nPrimary and Secondary Study Endpoints \n8.1.1 \nPrimary Endpoints \nThe primary endpoints for safety will be assessments of adverse events, physical \nexams, vital signs and clinical laboratory evaluations.  The primary endpoint of \ndevelopment of resistance will be determined from the genotypic and phenotypic \nvariables measured post baseline and is described further in the Resistance Plan. \n8.1.2 \nSecondary Endpoints \nThe following are secondary endpoints which measure efficacy, the primary of which \nis time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms.  With the exception of this variable, \nviral load and time to resolution of fever, they are defined as either the occurrence or \nnon-occurrence of the specified events or the presence or absence of the specified \nsymptoms. \nThe time (hours) to alleviation of all clinical influenza symptoms (recorded in \nthe patient diary)  \nShedding virus by culture at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15 and 40 \nShedding virus by RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 \nViral load by culture (log10TCID50/mL) at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40  \nViral load by quantitative RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15 and 40 \nThe time (hours) from first dose of study medication until resolution of fever  \nFever  \nCough   \nCoryza   \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 35 \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or \nsinusitis) at any time during the study \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or \nsinusitis) at any time during the study that are treated with antibiotics \nInitiation of treatment with antibiotics after randomization  \nHospitalization, and for those who are hospitalized, the duration of hospitalization \nDevelopment of rejection or GVHD \n8.1.3 \nSafety \nSafety of the treatment will be evaluated by AEs, physical exams, clinical laboratory \ntests, and vital signs. \nIn addition to routine safety assessments, the proportion of subjects experiencing a \nrejection and/or graft versus host disease will be summarized by treatment group.  \n8.2 \nStatistical and Analytical Methods  \n8.2.1 \nStatistical Model  \n8.2.1.1 \nTime to Event Variables \nA non-parametric model will be assumed with estimation of medians based on Kaplan-\nMeier methods. Subjects without alleviation of symptoms will have their time censored at \nthe last available observation that a complete assessment was made. \nFor the purpose of comparing treatment groups, it will be assumed that their respective \ndistributions for the primary endpoint differ only by a shift in location. \n8.2.1.2 \nDichotomous Variables and Viral Load  \nFor the endpoints defined dichotomously in terms of events or symptoms including the \ndevelopment of resistance, it will be assumed that the number of patients experiencing \nthe event or exhibiting the symptom will have a binomial distribution. \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 no model will \nbe assumed.  \n8.2.2 \nSample Size \nThe sample size has been chosen to provide an adequate number of patients to \nestimate the development of resistance with reasonable precision.  Assuming that \n90% of enrolled patients will have laboratory-confirmed influenza, there will be 75 \npatients in each treatment arm in the population evaluable for the development of \nresistance.  The following table shows the 95% Pearson-Clopper confidence \nintervals that would result with a sample size of 75 patients in a treatment arm if \ncertain event rates are observed in the study. \nDuring the study the number of influenza A virus infected patients and the rate of \ndevelopment resistance will be monitored in a blinded fashion, in order to ensure a \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 36 \nreasonable precision for the estimation.  An additional number of patients may be \nenrolled if necessary. \nObserved Rate (%) \n95% Confidence Interval \n0.0 \n  0%  - 4.8% \n1.3 \n0.0% - 7.2% \n2.7  \n0.3% - 9.3% \n5.3 \n1.5% - 13.1% \n10.7 \n4.7%-19.9% \n \nA total of 83 patients will be enrolled per arm and will be evaluable for the \nassessment of safety.  This number of patients would provide estimates of adverse \nevent rates with similar precision. \n8.2.3 \nHypothesis Testing  \nFormal hypothesis testing will be not performed, instead inferences will be based on \ncomparison of confidence intervals.  \n8.2.4 \nAnalysis Populations \nThree main patient populations will be used for the analysis of data from this study; the \nSafety Population, the Intent-to treat Population and the Intent-to-Treat Infected \nPopulation.  Detailed definitions of these populations will be given in the SAP.  \n8.2.4.1 \nIntent to Treat Population \nAll patients randomized will be included in the intent to treat population [Patients will be \nassigned to treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes]. \n8.2.4.2 \nIntent to Treat Infected Population \nAll patients randomized and with laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, \nexcluding patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline, will be \nincluded in the intent to treat influenza infected population [Patients will be assigned to \ntreatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes]. \nThe ITTI Population will be the primary population for the summary and analysis of the \ndevelopment of resistance and the efficacy variables. \n8.2.4.3 \nSubpopulations \nA subpopulation of the ITTI population will be defined comprising patients who \nreceived their first dose of study medication within 48 hours of influenza symptom \nonset for the comparison of efficacy endpoints with the age appropriate placebo \ntreated patients (pediatric or adult) from the registration trials. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 37 \nIn order to evaluate the potential for relapse, the following two subpopulations of the \nITTI population will be evaluated:  \n\u2022 patients not shedding virus as assessed by culture on Day 11 \n\u2022 patients not shedding virus as assessed by RT-PCR on Day 11 \n \nViral shedding and RT-PCR at days 15 and 40 will be evaluated in these subpopulations. \nBased on the proportion of subjects hospitalized, an additional subpopulation may be \ndefined to evaluate the length of hospitalization for hospitalized subjects. \nLikewise, based on the proportion of children enrolled additional subpopulations of \nchildren and adults will be created to evaluate the course of influenza in children and \nadults.  \n8.2.5 \nEfficacy Analysis \nFor the analysis of time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms, the following two \nassessments will be made independently of each other and without regard to the \noutcomes in each case. \n\u2022 Comparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials  \n \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment \napproval, a population of placebo treated patients will be established that is \ncomparable to the subpopulation of patients in the current study whose first dose \nof study medication was within 48 hours of symptom onset.  For this population, a \nmedian time to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms will be determined along \nwith its 95% confidence interval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.  These confidence intervals \nwill be compared individually to the placebo control confidence interval described \nabove as a potential means of establishing treatment effects. \n\u2022 Assessment of relative efficacy \n \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in \nthe median times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% \nconfidence interval.  \nThis confidence interval will provide lower and upper limits for the treatment difference \nand can be used as the basis for potential inferences. For example, if it does not contain \nthe value zero a difference will have been established.   \nFor the dichotomous endpoints, the proportion experiencing the event or symptom, and \nits associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment group.  Where \npossible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control population will \nbe presented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment groups in this trial. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 38 \nThe continuous secondary endpoint time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint.  \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load (log10TCID50/mL) at Day 1, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40, \nsummary statistics (including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and \nmaximum) will be derived for each treatment group. \n8.2.6 \nSafety Data Analysis \nThe safety analysis population will include all subjects who receive at least one dose and \nhad a safety assessment performed post randomization.  All safety variables will be \nsummarized and presented in tables based on this safety population. \n8.2.7 \nAnalysis of Resistance \nFor the summary of the development of resistance for each treatment arm, 95% \nconfidence intervals will be provided with the estimated rates.  Further details are \navailable in the Resistance Plan for NV20234.  These data will be summarized in a \nreport separate from the final study report. \n8.2.7.1 \nExclusion of Data from Analysis \nEfficacy data collected from any patient who begins treatment with another antiviral for \ninfluenza (for example, amantadine, rimantadine, laninamivir, peramivir, or \nzanamavir), after the other antiviral treatment commences, will be excluded from the \nprimary and secondary efficacy analyses.  Such patients will be considered failures to \noseltamivir treatment in the analyses.  Further details will be provided in the SAP. \n8.2.7.2 \nInterim Analysis \nNo interim analyses are planned.  \n8.2.8 \nOther Analyses \nFurther exploratory analysis, (including assessments of the rapid diagnostic test, sub \ngroup analysis) will be detailed in the SAP. \n9. \nDATA QUALITY ASSURANCE \nThe overall procedures for quality assurance of clinical study data are described in the \nRoche Standard Operational Procedures. \nAccurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross\u2013check of \nthe CRFs against the investigator\u2019s records by the study monitor [source document \nverification], and the maintenance of a drug\u2013dispensing log by the investigator.  \nThe data collected will be entered into the study database from the working copy of the \nCRF faxed from the site. \nA comprehensive validation check program will verify the data and discrepancy reports \nwill be generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator.  As patients complete the \nstudy [or prematurely withdraw] and their signed CRFs become available, a second data \nentry will be performed from the original, signed CRF.  A comparison check will be run \nto identify and resolve any discrepancies between the first and second data entry. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 39 \nThroughout the study the Study Management Team [SMT] will review data according to \nthe SMT Data Review Plan as described in the Data Quality Plan.  \n9.1 \nAssignment of Preferred Terms and Original Terminology \nFor classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by the sponsor to the original \nterms entered on the CRF, using the current version of MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for \nRegulatory Activities terminology) for adverse events and diseases and the INN \n(International Non-Proprietary name) drug terms and procedures dictionary for \ntreatments and surgical and medical procedures. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 40 \n10. \nREFERENCES \n1. \nMurphy B.G and Webster R.G.

The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in \u201cGuideline for Good \nClinical Practice\u201d ICH Tripartite Guideline [January 1997] or with local law if it affords \ngreater protection to the subject.  For studies conducted in the EU/EEA countries, the \ninvestigator will ensure compliance with the EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC].  \nFor studies conducted in the USA or under US IND, the investigator will additionally \nensure that the basic principles of \u201cGood Clinical Practice\u201d as outlined in the current \nversion of 21 CFR, subchapter D, part 312, \u201cResponsibilities of Sponsors and \nInvestigators\u201d, part 50, \u201cProtection of Human Subjects\u201d, and part 56, \u201cInstitutional \nReview Boards\u201d, are adhered to. \nIn other countries where \u201cGuideline for Good Clinical Practice\u201d exist Roche and the \ninvestigators will strictly ensure adherence to the stated provisions. \n11.2 \nInformed Consent  \nIt is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator [if \nacceptable by local regulations], to obtain written informed consent from each subject \nparticipating in this study, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated \nbenefits, and potential hazards of the study.  For subjects not qualified or incapable of \ngiving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legally acceptable \nrepresentative.  In the case where both the subject and his/her legally acceptable \nrepresentative are unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire \ninformed consent discussion.  After the subject and representative have orally consented \nto participation in the trial, the witness\u2019 signature on the form will attest that the \ninformation in the consent form was accurately explained and understood.  The \ninvestigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are completely free to refuse \nto enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason.  The Case Report \nForms [CRFs] for this study contain a section for documenting informed subject consent, \nand this must be completed appropriately.  If new safety information results in significant \nchanges in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated \nif necessary.  All subjects [including those already being treated] should be informed of \nthe new information, given a copy of the revised form and give their consent to continue \nin the study. \nIf children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the study, they should \nalso be informed and should also provide their written consent. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 45 \n11.3 \nIndependent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Board  \nIndependent Ethics Committees [non-US]:  This protocol and any accompanying \nmaterial provided to the subject [such as subject information sheets or descriptions of the \nstudy used to obtain informed consent] as well as any advertising or compensation given \nto the patient, will be submitted by the investigator to an Independent Ethics Committee.  \nApproval from the committee must be obtained before starting the study, and should be \ndocumented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the committee met \nand granted the approval. \nAny modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the Independent Ethics \nCommittee approval must also be submitted by the investigator to the Committee in \naccordance with local procedures and regulatory requirements. \nWhen no local review board exists, the investigator is expected to submit the protocol to \na regional committee.  If no regional committee exists, Roche will assist the investigator \nin submitting the protocol to the European Ethics Review Committee. \nInstitutional Review Board [US]:  It is the understanding of the sponsor that this \nprotocol [and any modifications] as well as appropriate consent procedures, will be \nreviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board.  This board must operate in \naccordance with the current Federal Regulations.  A letter or certificate of approval will \nbe sent by the investigator to the  sponsor or designee prior to initiation of the study, and \nalso whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made. \n12. \nCONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL \nProtocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between \nan appropriate representative of the sponsor and the investigator [investigator \nrepresentative[s] in the case of a multicenter trial].  Protocol modifications must be \nprepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially reviewed and approved by the \nClinical Science Leader/Clinical Pharmacologist and Biostatistician. \nAll protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Independent Ethics \nCommittee or Institutional Review Board for information and approval in accordance with \nlocal requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required.  Approval must be awaited \nbefore any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an \nimmediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the change[s] involves only logistical or \nadministrative aspects of the trial [e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone \nnumber[s]. \n13. \nCONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY \nBoth the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  \nShould this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual study \nbasis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, Roche and the investigator \nwill assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient\u2019s interests. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 46 \n14. \nSTUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS AND RECORD KEEPING \n14.1 \nInvestigator's Files / Retention of Documents \nThe Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of \nthe study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These \ndocuments should be classified into two different separate categories [1] Investigator's \nStudy File, and [2] subject clinical source documents. \nThe Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, Case Report and \nQuery Forms, Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and \ngovernmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, \nstaff \ncurriculum \nvitae \nand \nauthorization \nforms \nand \nother \nappropriate \ndocuments/correspondence etc.  \nSubject clinical source documents [usually defined by the project in advance to record \nkey efficacy/safety parameters independent of the CRFs] would include patient \nhospital/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original \nlaboratory reports, ECG, EEG, X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed \ninformed consent forms, consultant letters, and subject screening and enrollment logs.  \nThe Investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least 15 years \nafter completion or discontinuation of the study.  After that period of time the documents \nmay be destroyed, subject to local regulations.  \nShould the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to \nanother location, Roche must be notified in advance. \nIf the Investigator can not guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site \nfor any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the \nInvestigator and Roche to store these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that \nthey can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where \nsource documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies \nshould be made for storing outside of the site. \n14.2 \nSource Documents and Background Data \nThe investigator shall supply the sponsor or designee on request with any required \nbackground data from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly \nimportant when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are suspected.  In \ncase of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, it \nis also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that patient \nconfidentiality is protected. \n14.3 \nAudits and Inspections \nThe investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made \navailable to appropriately qualified personnel from the Roche Pharma Development \nQuality Assurance Unit or its designees, or to health authority inspectors after appropriate \nnotification.  The verification of the CRF data must be by direct inspection of source \ndocuments. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 47 \n14.4 \nCase Report Forms \nFor each patient enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal \ninvestigator or authorized delegate from the study staff.  This also applies to records for \nthose patients who fail to complete the study [even during a pre-randomization screening \nperiod if a CRF was initiated].  If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be \nnoted on the CRF.  If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment-\nlimiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. \nAll forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink, and must be legible.  Errors \nshould be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed \nand dated by the investigator or his/her authorized delegate.  The investigator should \nensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported to the \nsponsor or designee in the CRFs and in all required reports. \n15. \nMONITORING THE STUDY \nIt is understood that the responsible Roche monitor [or designee] will contact and visit \nthe investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the various records \nof the trial [CRFs and other pertinent data] provided that patient confidentiality is \nmaintained in accord with local requirements. \nIt will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout \nthe study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and \naccuracy of the data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to \nlaboratory test reports and other patient records needed to verify the entries on the CRF.  \nThe investigator [or his/her deputy] agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that \nany problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. \n16. \nCONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT \nRECORDS \nThe investigator must assure that subjects\u2019 anonymity will be maintained and that their \nidentities are protected from unauthorized parties.  On CRFs or other documents \nsubmitted to the sponsor or designee, subjects should not be identified by their names, but \nby an identification code.  The investigator should keep a subject enrollment log showing \ncodes, names and addresses.  The investigator should maintain documents not for \nsubmission to Roche, e.g., subjects\u2019 written consent forms, in strict confidence. \n17. \nPUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS \nThe results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is \nforeseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Roche prior to \nsubmission.  This allows the sponsor or designee to protect proprietary information and to \nprovide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available \nto the investigator. \nIn accord with standard editorial and ethical practice, Roche will generally support \npublication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In \nthis case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 48 \nAny formal publication of the study in which input of Roche personnel exceeded that of \nconventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and \nthe appropriate Roche personnel.

An AE may be considered probable, if: \n1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n2. It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject\u2019s \nclinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered \nto the subject. \n3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  [There are important \nexceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet \ndrug-relatedness clearly exists; e.g., [1] bone marrow depression, [2] tardive \ndyskinesias]. \n4. It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n5. It reappears upon rechallenge. \n \nPOSSIBLE [must have first two] \n1. This category applies to those AEs in which the connection with the test drug \nadministration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be \nconsidered possible if, or when: \n2. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n3. It may have been produced by the subject\u2019s clinical state, environmental or toxic \nfactors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. \n4. It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n \nREMOTE [must have first two] \n1. In general, this category is applicable to an AE which meets the following criteria: \n2. It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n3. It may readily have been produced by the subject\u2019s clinical state, environmental or \ntoxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. \n4. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n5. It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered. \n \nUNRELATED \nThis category is applicable to those AEs which are judged to be clearly and \nincontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes [disease, environment, etc.] and do not \nmeet the criteria for drug relationship listed under remote, possible, or probable. \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 54 \nAppendix 4 \nAdverse Event [AEs] Categories for Determining \nRelationship to Test Drug (Cont.) \n \nProbable \nPossible \nRemote \nUnrelated \nClearly due to extraneous causes \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n+ \n \n \n \n \n \nReasonable temporal association with drug \nadministration \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n \n \n \nMay be produced by subject clinical state, \netc. \n\u2013 \n+ \n+ \n+ \n \n \n \n \n \nKnown response pattern to suspected drug \n+ \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n \n \n \nDisappears or decreases on cessation or \nreduction in dose \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n \n \n \nReappears on rechallenge \n+ \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  Roche Protocol NV20234C  (Ro 64-0796)  - Page 55 \nAppendix 5 \nICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 \nA serious adverse event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect or precaution.  It is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 is fatal; [results in death] [NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event]. \n\u2013 is Life-Threatening    [NOTE: the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to \nan event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe]. \n\u2013 required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \nMedical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited \nreporting to the sponsor or designee is appropriate in other situations, such as important \nmedical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or \nhospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one \nof the outcomes listed in the definitions above. These situations should also usually be \nconsidered serious. \nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for \nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; \nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \nAn unexpected AE is one, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the \napplicable product information. \nCausality is initially assessed by the investigator.

The matrix proteins, \nM1 and M2 appear to trigger the disintegration of the M1 complex during virus fusion \nwith the cell and may also be involved in the maturation of the HA prior to assembly of \nnew virus particles.  The M2 protein triggers the disintegration of the virion during virus entry \ninto the cell and may also be involved in protecting the HA prior to assembly of new virus \nparticles. \nSECTION 1.1.1:  Influenza in the Immunodeficient Population \n. . . \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to disease \nHIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ T cell count of < 200/\u03bcL (AIDS defining) are highly \nsusceptible to opportunistic disease [16].  However, CD4 counts < 500/\u03bcL are considered \nabnormal in HIV-infected individuals, and therefore these individuals are also more susceptible to \ninfection.   \nSECTION 1.2:  RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY \nBecause of the increasing body of evidence (Section 1.1.2), oseltamivir is now \nrecommended in national guidelines as an option for the treatment of influenza in the \ntransplant population [37].  As the transplant population is considered representative, \nwhich comprises a significant portion of the immunocompromised population, the.  However, \nthere is limited data on safety and efficacy of oseltamivir use in this population.  The primary \nobjective of this study is to evaluate safety and resistance, while evaluating efficacy as a \nsecondary objective, in the broader immunocompromised patient population, who are \nconsidered at increased risk of viral infection. \nSECTION 2.2:  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES \n\u2022 \nThe time to resolution of influenza symptoms. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n3 \n \n\u2022 \nThe clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis).  \n\u2022 \nThe virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntime points). \n\u2022 \nTo estimate the population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate (e.g., \nclearance, volume of distribution) in immunocompromised patients with confirmed \ninfluenza infection, through the application of established population pharmacokinetic (PK) \nmodels to the sparse plasma concentration data generated.  \nSECTION 3.1.1.3:  Rational for Sparse PK Sampling \nLimited PK sampling will be done in this protocol, in patients who have provided additional \nconsent, and is justifiable in this study for the following two reasons: \n\u2022 \nThere are already tested and qualified population PK models available [36] that will be used \nto estimate exposure in the immunocompromised population on the basis of the data collected \nin this study, meaning extensive PK sampling over a steady-state dosing interval is not \nrequired.  \n\u2022 \nThe patient population in this study is likely to be very ill with a complex clinical picture \nand significant additional burden of treatment and monitoring due to their primary \ncondition.  In this context, it makes ethical sense to minimize blood draws and assessments \nto only those absolutely essential to meet the objectives of the study and to ensure patient \nsafety. \n \nSECTION 3.3:  CENTERS \nThis will be a multicenter study with approximately 100 110 centers taking place in the \nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres at approximately 125 centers. \nSECTION 4.2:  INCLUSION CRITERIA \n\u2022 \nRapid diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture positive for influenza in the 96 hours \nprior to first dose \n\u2022 \nImmunocompromised subject defined as one who meets any of the following: \no Primary immunodeficiency at risk for viral infections (representative \nexamples in Appendix 6) OR \no Secondary immunodeficiency \n\ufffd \nSOT with ongoing immunosuppression OR \n\ufffd \nAllogenic HSCT with ongoing immunosuppression OR \n\ufffd \nHIV with CD4 count < 200 < 500/mm3 and, in the investigator\u2019s \nopinion, considered immunocompromised OR \n\ufffd \nHematologic malignancies (representative examples in \nAppendix 7) OR \n\ufffd \nSystemic (e.g. enteric, sc, im or iv) immunosuppressive therapy, \nirrespective of medical indication, started at least 12 weeks prior \nto, and ongoing at the time of first dose of study drug \n(representative examples in Appendix 8) \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Routine patient \ncare (including the adjustment of doses of any of the immunosuppressive drugs) will be \ndictated by tests performed locally at the trial site.  For subjects unable to attend the clinic, \nprovision will be made for swabbing to be conducted at home, when there is a home visit \nscheduled.  Training will be provided to site staff on how to perform this.  All safety labs will be \nsent to a central laboratory.  Results for these laboratory parameters will be used by the \nsponsor/designee to assess overall safety. \nAll assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of \nAssessments (Table 1).  Additional information regarding these procedures not provided \nin the Schedule of Assessments is provided below. \nBlood samples will be collected from patients who provide additional consent for PK sampling, as \noutlined in Section 5.5. \nSECTION 5.5:  PHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS \n/PHARMACODYNAMIC ASSESSMENTS \nParticipation in PK assessments is not compulsory for this study.  Blood samples for the \ncharacterization of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics using a sparse \nsampling strategy will be collected from all patients who provide additional consent to participate \nin the PK assessments. \nBlood samples will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1) and as \ndescribed below.  If these blood samples are collected at a home visit, site staff should ensure the \nPK blood sample handling processing is not compromised.  The time and date of the dose and \nblood samples should be captured.  Further details on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics can \nbe found in Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.  \n5.5.1 \nPharmacokinetic Assessments \nPlasma PK samples for assessment of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will be collected at \nthe following timepoints on Day 6, or any day after the 11th dose, using the following sampling \napproach: \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

The following is a list of events that the investigator \nmust report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship \nto study drug: \n\u2022 \nSerious adverse events \n\u2022 \nPregnancies \n \nSECTION 7.2.1:  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events [immediately \nreportable] \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious [as defined in \nSection 7.1.1.3 above] and which occurs during the course of the study, regardless of \nthe treatment arm, occurring from the enrollment visit (start of study screening \nprocedures), must be reported to Roche or designee within one working day \nofimmediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event \n[expedited reporting]). \nSECTION 7.2.2:  Pregnancy \nA female subject must be instructed to stop taking the test \u201cdrug\u201d and immediately inform \nthe investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.  The investigator should \nreport all pregnancies within immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator \nbecomes aware of the pregnancy) to the Sponsor or designee.  The investigator should \ncounsel the subject, and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the \npossible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion \nof the pregnancy.  Pregnancies occurring within 28 days of treatment completion should \nbe reported to Roche.  \nSECTION 8.1.2:  Secondary Endpoints \nThe following are the model-predicted PK secondary endpoints for both oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate: \n\u2022 \nSteady-state area under the concentration\u2013time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12) \n) for both oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate \n\u2022 \nMaximum plasma concentration (Cmax\n) for both oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate \n\u2022 \nTrough plasma concentration (Ctrough\n \nThe following model-predicted PK endpoints may be included, if appropriate:  \n\u2022 \nElimination half-life (t1/2) \n) \n\u2022 \nTime to maximum concentration (tmax\n) \n\u2022 \nElimination constant (ke\n\u2022 \nApparent clearance (CL/F) \n\u2022 \nApparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) \n\u2022 \nApparent total clearance of metabolite (CLm) \n\u2022 \nLast measurable concentration (Clast) and time to last measurable concentration (tlast)  \n \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n8 \n \nSECTION 8.2.4.3:  Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Patient Population (PKEP) \nThe PKEP population comprises all patients in the ITT population who have at least one post-\ndose drug concentration measurement at a scheduled visit timepoint.  Patients may be excluded \nfrom the PKEP population if they significantly violate the inclusion or exclusion criteria, deviate \nsignificantly from the protocol, or have unavailable or incomplete data that may influence the PK \nanalysis.  \nDecisions on patient exclusion from the PK analysis will be made prior to database closure by the \nclinical pharmacologist.  Excluded patients will be documented along with the reason for \nexclusion. \nSECTION 8.3:  PHARMACOKINETIC AND PHARMACODYNAMIC \nANALYSIS \n8.3.1 \nPharmacokinetic Analysis \nThe primary study variables are the model-predicted PK parameters:  steady-state AUC0-12, Cmax, \nand Ctrough of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. \nSecondary model-predicted PK variables may be included for both oseltamivir and oseltamivir \ncarboxylate, if appropriate:  t1/2, tmax, k , CL/F, Vc/F, CL\ne\nm, Clast and tlast. \nIndividual and mean plasma concentrations at each sampling timepoint for oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate will be presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics, \nincluding means, geometric means, medians, ranges, standard deviations, and coefficients of \nvariation.  Individual and mean concentration-versus-time profiles will be plotted on linear and \nsemi-logarithmic scales. \nPlasma concentration data from sparse sampling will be analyzed using an established population \nPK model to determine key exposure parameters (e.g., Cmax, Ctrough, and AUC).  For \nimmunocompromised children aged 1 to 18 years, plasma oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate \nconcentrations will be modeled in NONMEM using a structure similar to a comprehensive \npopulation PK model, which was previously developed using plasma data of \nnon-immunocompromised children and adults (ages 1 to 80 years) [36].  The basic structure \nconsists of a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and direct conversion of \noseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate, while a 1-compartment model is used to account for the \nrenal elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate from the plasma.  Body weight, evaluated using a \npower function and centered around 70 kg, is a statistically significant predictor of the CL/F for \noseltamivir, and both CL/F and central volume of distribution (Vc/F) for oseltamivir carboxylate.  \nFor oseltamivir carboxylate, CrCl is also a significant predictor of CL/F, while Vc/F decreases \nlinearly with age. \n8.3.2 \nPharmacodynamic Analysis \nIf feasible, the relationship between PK exposure of oseltamivir carboxylate and viral shedding \nresponse data will be characterized using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (using software \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n9 \n \nNONMEM).  Relevant population pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters will be derived, and the \ninfluence of covariates will be investigated.  If deemed appropriate and necessary, data may be \npooled with data from previous studies investigating oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in \norder to improve the model stability. \nSAMPLE INFORMED CONSENT FORMS \nThe sample Informed Consent Forms have been revised to reflect the changes to the \nprotocol. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n19 \n \nPART I: STUDY DESIGN AND CONDUCT \n1. \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n1.1 \nBACKGROUND \nInfluenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by a virus of the orthomyxovirus family \nwhich occurs in three forms, influenza A, B and C.  Influenza virus types A and B cause \nan acute febrile infection of the respiratory tract characterized by the sudden onset of \nfever, malaise, headaches, myalgias and cough.  Influenza causes numerous deaths \neach year [1].  Although difficult to assess, annual influenza epidemics are thought to \nresult in between three and five million cases of severe illness, and between 250,000 \nand 500,000 deaths every year around the world [2]. \nThe influenza viruses are segmented, negative sense, single stranded, lipid \nencapsulated, RNA viruses between 80 and 100 nm in size.  Subtypes are defined \naccording to glycoproteins present in the viral lipid coat.  The haemagglutinin complex \n(HA) is the major surface protein of the virus.  The neuraminidase (NA) proteins are the \nsecond major surface proteins in the virion and play a role in enhancing virus penetration \nof the mucus layer around the target cell and in release of virus from the cell surface.  \nThe M2 protein triggers the disintegration of the virion during virus entry into the cell and may \nalso be involved in protecting the HA prior to assembly of new virus particles.  \n1.1.1 \nInfluenza in the Immunodeficient Population \nInfluenza infection is usually a self limiting condition.  However, in children, the elderly \nand the immunocompromised, influenza infection can be associated with substantial \nmorbidity and mortality [1].  In patients with compromised immunity, influenza virus may \ncause severe lower respiratory tract involvement; unusual syndromes, including \nencephalitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis and death [3].   \nConditions that compromise immunity may be classified based on etiology into primary \n(genetic) and secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency.  Of the immunodeficient \nconditions, the ones that affect cell mediated immunity are likely to have adverse \noutcomes following viral infections [16]. \nPrimary immunodeficiency  \nPrimary immunodeficiencies are relatively common, may be either congenital or manifest \nlater in life and are classified according to whether the genetic defect affects T or B cells \nor both [16].  There are four groups of disorders:  severe combined immunodeficiency \n(SCID), primary T cell deficiency (e.g. CD8 deficiency, DiGeorge syndrome), \npredominantly B-cell-related antibody deficiency (e.g. common variable immunodeficiency, \nselective IgA deficiency) and other well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes (e.g. \nWiskott Aldrich syndrome) [16].  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n20 \n \nOf the primary immunodeficiencies, antibody deficiencies are the most frequent.  \nHowever, some of the more common antibody deficiency conditions (isolated IgA \ndeficiency, IgG subclass deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency) have intact \ncell-mediated immunity and therefore the clinical course of viral infections (unless \ncomplicated by bacterial infections) does not differ significantly from that in the normal \nhost [16].  A list of primary immunodeficiency disorders at risk for viral infections is \nprovided in Appendix 6.  The incidence of some of these conditions has been estimated.  \nThe incidence of SCID is 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 [16].  The more severe forms of \nprimary immunodeficiency are relatively rare, have their onset early in life, and all too \nfrequently result in death during childhood [16].  \nSecondary Immunodeficiency \nSecondary immunodeficiencies are not caused by intrinsic abnormalities in development \nof T and B cells [16].  Secondary immunodeficiency may result from diseases (human \nimmunodeficiency virus [HIV], hematologic malignancy) or immunosuppressive and \ncytotoxic drugs (such as those used for treatment of transplant recipients, collagen \nvascular disease, malignancies).  \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to disease \nHIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ T cell count of < 200/\u03bcL (AIDS defining) are highly \nsusceptible to opportunistic disease [16].  However, CD4 counts < 500/\u03bcL are considered \nabnormal in HIV-infected individuals, and therefore these individuals are also more susceptible to \ninfection.  Studies in HIV/AIDS subjects have shown an increased risk for heart and \nlung-related hospitalizations during the influenza season compared to other times of the \nyear, prolonged duration of influenza symptoms, increased risk for influenza-related \ncomplications and a higher risk of influenza-related death [17]. \nSeveral hematologic malignancies affect the immune system (Appendix 7).  Several \nauthors have reported influenza in children and adults with hematologic malignancies \n[18, 19, 20, 21].  \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to drugs (e.g. transplant recipients, collagen \nvascular disease, malignancies) \nThe enhanced survival of the transplant population following the availability of newer \nimmunosuppressive drugs has made them representative of the immunocompromised \npopulation in general; and secondary immunodeficiency due to drugs, in particular. \nIn transplant recipients influenza is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary \ncomplications, extrapulmonary manifestations and an increased risk of graft dysfunction \nand high attributable mortality.  In a cohort study of influenza viral infection in solid organ \ntransplant (SOT) subjects, 30 cases of influenza viral infection were identified.  \nSecondary bacterial pneumonia was seen in 17% of subjects and three SOT recipients \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n21 \n \n(2 liver and one kidney) had myositis, myocarditis and bronchiolitis obliterans.  Biopsy of \nthe transplanted organ was performed in 21 of 30 cases and revealed variable degrees \nof acute allograft rejection in 62% of subjects.  The study concluded that influenza was \nassociated with significant morbidity in different groups of SOT recipients [4]. \nAmong transplant recipients, subjects with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are \nat the greatest risk for morbidity.  In a prospective study from the Infectious Diseases \nWorking Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 1973 \npatients were evaluated for respiratory virus infections after stem cell transplantation.  \nThe overall mortality was 23% from influenza A infection and the direct influenza A-\nassociated mortality was 15.3% in this study [5].  A large retrospective study \n(4797 subjects undergoing HSCT over a 13-year period) identified 62 patients with \ninfluenza of whom as many as 29% (18 of 62 patients) developed pneumonia.  Ten \npercent of the subjects with influenza died [6].  \nThe increased morbidity in transplant patients is associated with increased duration of \nvirus shedding compared to that in healthy subjects.  In otherwise healthy adults, elderly \nsubjects and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated subjects was \n70, 96 and 118 hours respectively [7].  In contrast, in the retrospective HSCT study, \ninfluenza virus was shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a \nmedian duration of 168 hours (7 days, range 2 to 37 days) [6]. \nCurrently available treatments for influenza infection are the M2 ion channel inhibitors \n(e.g. amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir, \nzanamivir).  \n1.1.2 \nOseltamivir \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Ro 64-0796) is an ethyl ester prodrug which is rapidly absorbed \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and metabolized in the liver by \nhigh capacity carboxylesterases to form oseltamivir carboxylate (Ro 64-0802), a potent, \nstable and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes.  The active \nform, oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted unchanged by the kidney via glomerular \nfiltration and active tubular secretion by the organic anion transport system.  The efficacy \nand safety of oseltamivir in influenza treatment and prevention has been established in \nan extensive series of clinical studies in man. \nOseltamivir has been approved for the treatment of influenza in Europe, the United \nStates and most other countries around the world.  In adults and adolescents, the \nrecommended dose is 75 mg twice daily for five days.  In children 1 year of age and \nolder recommended doses are 30, 45 or 60 mg bid based on body weight.  In all age \ngroups the recommended dose is administered bid for 5 days.   \nThe approval of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza is based on several controlled \nclinical trials.  In the pooled population from these clinical trials encompassing adults \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n22 \n \naged from 13-97 years, many with significant co-morbidity, 1325 subjects were treated \nwith oseltamivir (75 mg bid) and 1056 subjects received placebo.  A total of seven \ninfluenza symptoms (both respiratory and constitutional) were captured on the diary card \nfor adults.  The time to resolution of all symptoms (on the diary card) decreased by \n24 hours; from 124.5 hours in the placebo arm to 100.6 hours with oseltamivir 75 mg bid \n(p < 0.0001) [7].  Further, in adults and adolescents with a proven influenza illness, \noseltamivir treatment reduced overall antibiotic use for any reason by 26.7% and the \nincidence of influenza-related lower respiratory tract complications resulting in antibiotic \ntherapy by 55%.  The study concluded that oseltamivir treatment of influenza reduces \nlower respiratory tract complications, antibiotic use and hospitalizations in healthy and \u2018at \nrisk\u2019 subjects [8].   \nLikewise, in the influenza-infected pediatric population (1 to 12 years of age), oseltamivir \ntreatment (n = 217) was compared with placebo (n = 235).  There was a reduction  in  the \nmedian duration of illness (defined based on resolution of temperature, cough, coryza \nand return to pre-illness health and activity) of 36 hours; from 137 hours with placebo to \n101 hours in the oseltamivir treatment arm (p \u2264 0.0001).  The Canadian Acute \nRespiratory Infections Scale (CARIFS), validated for use in children, was used to collect \nsymptom data on the pediatric diary card.  The CARIFS scale comprised a total of 18 \nsymptoms which were evaluated twice daily by the parent or guardian.  There was a \nsimilar reduction in the time to alleviation of all CARIFS symptoms of 36 hours; from 100 \nhours in the placebo group to 63 hours in the oseltamivir group (p < 0.0001) [9].  \nThus in both adults and children, the time to resolution of all symptoms was significantly \nreduced in the oseltamivir treatment arm compared with placebo.   \nOseltamivir was well-tolerated in clinical trials.  Approximately 11,000 subjects have \nreceived oseltamivir in the development program.  The most common adverse events \nreported by adults, the elderly, and children were nausea and vomiting.  Serious adverse \nevents (SAEs) were reported with a low and equal frequency by subjects taking active \ndrug and placebo.  Full details are given in the Investigator Brochure [7]. \nThe safety profile of oseltamivir has been well characterized for the prophylaxis \nindication in a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial conducted in the adult \nand pediatric immunocompromised (HSCT and SOT) population.  In the oseltamivir \ngroup, the indications for transplant included hematologic malignancies (acute and \nchronic leukemias, multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome), lymphoid \nmalignancies (Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphomas), primary immunodeficiencies \n(Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease and severe combined \nimmunodeficiency).  Other rare indications included bone marrow aplasia, paroxysmal \nnocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelofibrosis and multiple sclerosis.  In the safety population, \nthere were 239 subjects randomized to the conventional dose of oseltamivir and 238 to \nplacebo.  The total number of adverse events reported in the placebo group (361 events) \nwas generally similar to that in the oseltamivir group (323 events).  Diarrhea was the \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n23 \n \nmost frequently reported adverse event (placebo, 8%; oseltamivir, 6%).  There were no \ndeaths in the oseltamivir group.  Oseltamivir was found to be safe in immunosuppressed \ntransplant recipients [22]. \nLimited safety and/or efficacy of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is available from \nseveral case reports in children and adolescents.  Oseltamivir was shown to be safe \nand/or effective in HIV infected children (n = 10) [23], children (age 3 to 12 years) with \nacute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n = 10) [21], in a nosocomial H1N1 outbreak in a \npediatric (children aged 10 months to 13 years) oncology ward (n = 8) [20], in children \nand adolescents (age 2 to 19 years) with malignancies (ALL, neuroblastoma, brain \ntumor, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myelodysplasia, acute \nmyeloid leukemia (AML), Wilms tumor, aplastic anemia, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) \nand acute promyelocytic leukemia) (n = 51) [18], in children aged 4 to 14 years on \nimmunosuppressive drugs (n = 5) [24] and in children (aged 5 months to 5 years) with \nbone marrow transplant (n = 3) [25].  \nOseltamivir has also been shown to be safe and/or effective in mixed populations of \nchildren and adults (62 patients) with HSCT [6], and in a large epidemiologic study \n(n = 221) with SOT [26].  \nFinally, oseltamivir has been shown to be safe and/or effective in immunocompromised \nadults with HSCT [10] and adults with lung transplant [27, 28, 29].  \nThe dose of oseltamivir was the same as the conventional dose in a majority of these \nreports.  In one report as many as 25 adult patients received twice the conventional dose \n[26] while in another report, three of nine adult patients received twice the conventional \ndose [29].  Treatment with oseltamivir generally ranged from 5 to 10 days [28, 29, 26] \nand occasionally until the patient was symptom free [28, 29].  In exceptional cases \ntreatment was given for as long as 20 days [18] or for as long as the patient was positive \nby RT-PCR [21]. \nThere is some concern about the development of resistance in the immunocompromised \npopulation.  During the pandemic influenza season, more than 23,000 clinical isolates of \nnovel H1N1 pandemic virus were tested for resistance in the 6 international WHO \nregions.  A total of 225 isolates (from 225 subjects) were resistant (H275Y mutation in \nthe neuraminidase coding sequence) to oseltamivir for an approximate incidence of 1%.  \nInformation on immune status was available for 142 of 225 patients.  Among the 142 \npatients, 56 (40%) were immunocompromised [30].  Prolonged viral replication and lack \nof immune-mediated virus clearance in immunosuppressed patients treated with \nantivirals can result in a higher incidence of selection of drug-resistant viruses, a \nphenomenon that has been documented previously [31, 32].  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n24 \n \n1.2 \nRATIONALE FOR THE STUDY  \nBecause of the increasing body of evidence (Section 1.1.2), oseltamivir is recommended \nin national guidelines as an option for the treatment of influenza in the transplant \npopulation [37], which comprises a significant portion of the immunocompromised population.  \nHowever, there is limited data on safety and efficacy of oseltamivir use in this population.  The \nprimary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and resistance, while evaluating \nefficacy as a secondary objective, in the broader immunocompromised patient population, \nwho are considered at increased risk of viral infection. \n2. \nOBJECTIVES  \n2.1 \nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE \nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate prospectively the safety and tolerability \nof oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients and \ncharacterize the effects of oseltamivir in immunocompromised patients on the \ndevelopment of resistant influenza virus. \n2.2 \nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES   \nThe secondary objectives of the study are:  \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and high dose oseltamivir in \nimmunocompromised patients on: \n\u2022 \nThe time to resolution of influenza symptoms. \n\u2022 \nThe clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis).  \n\u2022 \nThe virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntime points). \n\u2022 \nTo estimate the population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate (e.g., \nclearance, volume of distribution) in immunocompromised patients with confirmed \ninfluenza infection, through the application of established population pharmacokinetic (PK) \nmodels to the sparse plasma concentration data generated.  \n \n3. \nSTUDY DESIGN \n3.1 \nOVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND DOSING REGIMEN   \nThis is a double blind, randomized, stratified, multi-center trial of conventional and high \ndose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients.  \nImmunocompromised patients who develop an influenza-like illness with a positive rapid \ndiagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture for influenza, will be enrolled during the influenza \nseason.  Patients will be stratified by transplant status [yes, no], the time between onset \nof influenza symptoms and treatment start (up to 96 hours) [ \u2264 48 hours; > 48 hours], \ninfluenza vaccination status for current influenza season [Yes; No] and by age [ \u2264 12 \nyears; > 12 years].  Eligible patients will be consented and randomized to receive \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n25 \n \noseltamivir twice daily for 10 days in one of two treatment arms:  conventional dose or \nhigh dose (double the conventional dose).  \n3.1.1 \nRationale for Study Design \nThis study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo \ncontrolled trials.  \nThere is no placebo control arm in this study as it was considered unethical for this high \nrisk population.  The development of resistance following treatment with oseltamivir (one \nof the primary objectives of the study) is an objective assessment (determined by \nlaboratory tests) and is unlikely to be impacted by the absence of a placebo arm.  \nAs a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this population, an alternative \ncontrol arm had to be identified for efficacy end points.  The response to placebo in \npivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was \nchosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial.  In order to do this, the \nend points were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal registration trials.  \nThe following sections provide rationale and justification for specific aspects of the study \ndesign which differ from the currently approved dosing for influenza or from previous \npivotal registration trials.  They also provide information on how the results will be used \nto make recommendations on dose and duration of treatment. \n3.1.1.1 \nChoice of Treatment Arms \nThe currently approved dose of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is the \nconventional dose with a duration of five days.  In this study a conventional and high \ndose (twice the conventional dose) are being evaluated.  The pivotal registration trials for \noseltamivir in healthy adults with influenza had three treatment arms, two active (75 mg \nand 150 mg) and one placebo.  Both treatment arms were found to be significantly better \nthan placebo.  No statistical comparisons were made between the two active treatment \narms.  Evaluation of the results in the two active treatment arms did not reveal any \nclinically meaningful difference.  However, the proportion of subjects shedding virus on \nday 4 (3 days after the start of treatment), suggested a possible dose response \nrelationship (36%, 28% and 23% in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg dose arms \nrespectively).  Because defective immune-mediated virus clearance in \nimmunosuppressed patients treated with antivirals can result in a higher incidence of \nselection of drug-resistant viruses, it was decided to use both the conventional and high \ndose arm for this study.  A longer duration of treatment was chosen because a large \nretrospective study has shown that the median duration of viral shedding of 7 days [6] \nwas greater for HSCT recipients than that seen in the healthy children, adult and elderly \npopulation with influenza (Section 1.1.1) [7].  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n26 \n \n3.1.1.2 \nInclusion of Patients Symptomatic up to 96 Hours \nIn immunocompromised patients, time from onset of symptoms to seeking medical \nattention (presentation at the clinic) of  > 48 hours has been shown in several case \nreports [33, 27, 28, 29] including two instances of nosocomial outbreaks in children [25, \n20].  This notwithstanding, oseltamivir has been shown to be effective in \nimmunocompromised populations that included patients treated with oseltamivir beyond \n48 hours of presentation; patients with lung transplant (median time to presentation 3 \ndays) [27], bone marrow transplant (treatment started more than 48 hours after onset of \nsymptoms in all three patients) [25], organ transplant (62 out of 221 patients started \ntreatment after 96 hours) [26] and children with ALL (one child presented after 3 days \nand two children after 5 days of symptoms) [21]. \nIn a prospective, observational study involving adults hospitalized with influenza, the \nstudy authors concluded that \u2018Weakened host defenses slow viral clearance, whereas \nantivirals started within the first four days of illness enhance viral clearance\u2019 [34].  \nAdditionally, in November 2009, in a communication for clinicians on antiviral treatments \nfor H1N1, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that while \nantiviral treatment is most effective when started early; both outpatients with risk factors \nand hospitalized patients still benefit when treatment with oseltamivir is started more \nthan 48 hours after illness onset [35].   \n3.1.1.3 \nRational for Sparse PK Sampling \nLimited PK sampling will be done in this protocol, in patients who have provided additional \nconsent, and is justifiable in this study for the following two reasons: \n\u2022 \nThere are already tested and qualified population PK models available [36] that will be used \nto estimate exposure in the immunocompromised population on the basis of the data collected \nin this study, meaning extensive PK sampling over a steady-state dosing interval is not \nrequired.  \n\u2022 \nThe patient population in this study is likely to be very ill with a complex clinical picture \nand significant additional burden of treatment and monitoring due to their primary \ncondition.  In this context, it makes ethical sense to minimize blood draws and assessments \nto only those absolutely essential to meet the objectives of the study and to ensure patient \nsafety. \n \n3.1.1.4 \nInterpretation of Study Results  \nSafety and tolerability and the development of resistance are the primary objectives of \nthis study.  These will be characterized descriptively.  For the secondary objective of \nefficacy, the subset of the population enrolled in the first 48 hours will be compared with \nplacebo patients from pivotal registration trials (where patients were enrolled in the first \ntwo days of illness).  Sections 8.2.5, 8.2.6, and 8.2.7 provide details on the statistical \nconsiderations and their rationale associated with these comparisons. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n27 \n \nStratification \nStratification in this study has no bearing on any comparisons with results from previous \ntrials.  However, in order to evaluate a dose response relationship between the two \nactive treatment arms in this trial, stratification remains essential.  \nPatients will be stratified by transplant status (yes, no) because transplant patients form \na relatively large homogenous group in this study and might influence outcome.  \nPatients will be stratified by time between onset of symptoms and treatment start \n( < 48 hours or \u2265 48 hours) because previous experience in otherwise healthy adults and \nchildren has shown that patients treated early in their illness respond to treatment better \nthan those who are treated later.  Patients will also be stratified by age ( \u2264 12 years \nand > 12 years) because otherwise healthy children shed virus longer than otherwise \nhealthy adults.  It is expected that a similar difference in the duration of viral shedding \nwould exist between immunocompromised children and adults.  As vaccinated subjects \nmay respond faster to therapy, the study is also stratified based on influenza vaccination \nstatus for the current influenza season (Yes; No).  \n3.1.2 \nRationale for Dose Selection and Adjustment \nDose Selection \nThe dose of oseltamivir to be used in this study is the conventional, approved dose for \nchildren and adults in the treatment of influenza.  There will be a second higher dose for \ncomparison which is two times the conventional dose.  This higher dose is used based \non theoretical considerations which suggest that the higher dose may be associated with \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance.  \nThe anticipated pro-drug and metabolite exposures from this higher dose are not \nexpected to exceed maximum exposures seen previously in the oseltamivir development \nprogram.  The safety and tolerability of the higher dose regimen has already been \ndemonstrated in treatment studies of immunocompetent adult subjects (n = 447) [11].  In \na study to demonstrate cardiac safety, in the highest dose group treated with 450 mg \nb.i.d. for 5 days [n = 99], no subject had a serious adverse event, nor withdrew \nprematurely.  In Phase I studies in adults, oseltamivir has been administered in multiple \ndoses of up to 500 mg b.i.d.  Doses of 200 mg b.i.d. and greater have been associated \nwith increased gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) [7].  In adult \nsubjects with creatinine clearances of \u2264 30 mL/min, doses of 100 mg b.i.d. for 6 days \nwere well tolerated, despite steady-state oseltamivir carboxylate exposures \napproximately 10-fold higher than those achieved with standard dosing in renally \ncompetent individuals [12].  No other adverse effects were reported more frequently with \nhigher doses and no serious adverse events have been reported within the volunteer \nstudies.  Co-administration of oseltamivir with food has been demonstrated to \nsubstantially reduce the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal side effects.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n28 \n \nThus, the rationale for the higher dose arm in this study is to explore the possibility of \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance without an undue increase in \nrisk.  \nDrug interactions with immunosuppressive medications have also been evaluated.  The \npharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate after administration of \n75 mg oseltamivir (conventional adult dose) in subjects with a well-functioning, stable \nrenal allograft who were being maintained on immunosuppressive therapy were studied.  \nThese were similar to those described in the literature for adults with comparable \ndegrees of renal function.  Oseltamivir was well tolerated and had no clinically relevant \neffect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or \nmycophenolate mofetil [7]. \nDuration of Dosing \nThe duration of dosing chosen for this population (10 days) is longer than that in the \nhealthy adult and pediatric populations (5 days).  This is based on observations that the \nviral shedding and illness are typically longer in immunocompromised patients than it is \nin healthy adults [6, 10]. \nDose Adjustments \nIn this study, patients whose CrCl decreases to  < 60mL/min/1.73M2 will be discontinued \nfrom treatment. \n3.1.3 \nEnd of Study \nThe study comprises 10 days of treatment with follow up visits approximately 5 and 30 \ndays later as shown in the schedule of assessments.  A rapid diagnostic test for \ninfluenza will be performed at the end of the 10 days of treatment.  Subjects still having \ninfluenza based on the rapid diagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care \nby the principal investigator.  \n3.2 \nNUMBER OF SUBJECTS/ ASSIGNMENT TO TREATMENT \nGROUPS \nA minimum of 166 patients (approximately 83 per arm) to allow an adequate number of \ninfluenza A patients, including 50 transplant recipients will be enrolled in this study.  After \nscreening, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two active treatment groups. \n3.3 \nCENTERS \nThis will be a multicenter study taking place in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres at \napproximately 125 centers.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n29 \n \n4. \nSTUDY POPULATION \n4.1 \nOVERVIEW \nThe study population comprises immunocompromised adults (including adolescents) \nand children who have influenza.  Additionally, the subjects must not have other medical \nconditions that will preclude the assessment of efficacy or safety.  Influenza vaccinated \nand non-vaccinated subjects are eligible to participate in this study.  Principal \ninvestigators will review oseltamivir resistance patterns of strains circulating in the area \nand weigh the risk versus the benefit before enrolling patients with a potentially resistant \nstrain. \nUnder no circumstances are patients who enroll in this study permitted to be re-\nrandomized to this study and enrolled for a second course of treatment. \n4.2 \nINCLUSION CRITERIA \n\u2022 \nAge greater than or equal to 1 year \n\u2022 \nRapid diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture positive for influenza \n\u2022 \nImmunocompromised subject defined as one who meets any of the following: \no Primary immunodeficiency at risk for viral infections (representative \nexamples in Appendix 6) OR \no Secondary immunodeficiency \n\ufffd \nSOT with ongoing immunosuppression OR \n\ufffd \nAllogenic HSCT with ongoing immunosuppression OR \n\ufffd \nHIV with CD4 count < 500/mm3 and, in the investigator\u2019s opinion, \nconsidered immunocompromised OR \n\ufffd \nHematologic malignancies (representative examples in \nAppendix 7) OR \n\ufffd \nSystemic (e.g. enteric, sc, im or iv) immunosuppressive therapy, \nirrespective of medical indication, started at least 12 weeks prior \nto, and ongoing at the time of first dose of study drug \n(representative examples in Appendix 8) \n \n\u2022 \nSymptoms suggestive of influenza like illness including, but not limited to fever, \ncough, or coryza \n\u2022 \nIn patients with history or clinical presentation at randomization suggestive of renal \nfailure; a CrCl > 60 ml/min/1.73M2 \n\u2022 \nLess than or equal to 96 hours between onset of influenza like illness and first dose \nof study drug \n\u2022 \nParent/guardian willing and able to comply with study requirements and give \nconsent, (country specific age cut off) \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n30 \n \n\u2022 \nPatient able to comply with study requirements and willing to give assent, as \nappropriate (country specific age cut off) \n\u2022 \nFor adult patients, willing and able to comprehend and give written informed consent  \n\u2022 \nPatients, in the reproductive age group, must agree to utilize an effective method of \ncontraception throughout the study period and for females for one reproductive \ncycle following cessation of study therapy \n\u2022 \nFemales of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to \nstart of study medication \n \n4.3 \nEXCLUSION CRITERIA \n\u2022 \nClinical evidence of severe hepatic impairment, defined as Child-Pugh grade C (score > 9) or \ndecompensated cirrhosis. \n\u2022 \nPatients currently receiving any form of renal replacement therapy including \nhemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration. \n\u2022 \nHave evidence of a serious secondary respiratory or disseminated infection that may \nconfound or overlay the diagnosis and/or symptomatology of influenza. \n\u2022 \nPatients with gastrointestinal disorders which might interfere with their ability to \nabsorb oral medication.  \n\u2022 \nAllergy to the test medication. \n\u2022 \nPatients with hereditary fructose intolerance (for subjects who will be taking the \nliquid formulation). \n\u2022 \nInfluenza vaccination with live attenuated vaccine in the 2 weeks prior to \nrandomization. \n\u2022 \nAntiviral treatment (example:  amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir, laninamivir, \nperamivir, zanamivir and ribavirin) for influenza in the 2 weeks prior to \nrandomization. \n\u2022 \nPatients taking probenecid medication. \n\u2022 \nPatients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.   \n\u2022 \nParticipated in a clinical trial or expanded access trial with an investigational drug \nsuspected/demonstrated to impact pathways important for the metabolism and excretion of \noseltamivir in the 4 weeks prior to randomization or concomitantly with this study.   \n \n4.4 \nCONCOMITANT MEDICATION AND TREATMENT \nAntiviral treatments with activity against influenza (e.g. amantadine, rimantadine, \nzanamivir, ribavirin, laninamivir, peramivir, and additional oseltamivir above that \nspecified for this study) are not allowed during the 10-day treatment phase of the study.  \nConcomitant use of an investigational drug during the study is also excluded.  Live \nattenuated vaccines may not be advisable for this population.  It is possible that \nconcurrent use with oseltamivir may render live vaccines ineffective.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n31 \n \nMedications required for the routine care of the patient may be continued during the \nstudy.  Concomitant use of probenecid (irrespective of the indication) is not allowed \nduring the study. \n4.5 \nCRITERIA FOR PREMATURE WITHDRAWAL  \nThe investigator must discontinue treatment if the creatinine clearance is  < 60 ml/min in \nadults or < 60 ml/min/1.73 M2 in children.  The investigator must also discontinue \ntreatment from all subjects with intercurrent illnesses or adverse events suggestive of \nhepatic decompensation.  The investigator also has the right to discontinue treatment in \nthe event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, treatment failure, protocol violations, \nadministrative reasons or other reasons. \nThe investigator must discontinue treatment with study drug if the patient is to be treated \nconcomitantly with another antiviral for influenza, for example, amantadine, rimantadine, \nlaninamivir, peramivir, or zanamavir.  However, all patients, including those who \ndiscontinue study drug prematurely and/or are treated with another antiviral, will be \nrequired to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose of study \nmedication (day 15 and day 40 assessments). \nSubjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  \nAn excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, \nunnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  Should a subject decide to \nwithdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations prior to \nwithdrawal as thoroughly as possible. \nThe investigator should contact the subject or a responsible relative either by telephone \nor through a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the \nwithdrawal.  A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient\u2019s withdrawal should be \nmade with an explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study.  If the reason \nfor removal of a subject from the study is an Adverse Event, the principal specific event \nwill be recorded on the CRF. \nIn the case that the subject decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment [\u201crefuses \ntreatment\u201d], he/she should be asked if he/she can still be contacted for further \ninformation.  The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical \nrecords and in the CRF.  \n4.6 \nREPLACEMENT POLICY [ENSURING ADEQUATE NUMBERS \nOF EVALUABLE SUBJECTS] \n4.6.1 \nFor Subjects \nNo subject prematurely discontinued from the study for any reason will be replaced. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n32 \n \nTable 1 \nSchedule of Assessments (cont.)  \nf  A home visit may be made on day 2 or 3 (for patients who are too ill to come into the clinic) \nand/or, day 6, and/or day 8; however, it is recommended that the PK blood draw be performed at the \nclinic. \ng. Day 2/3 visit window = +1 day.  Day 6 visit window = +/- 1 day; Day 8 visit window = +1 day.  \nDay 11 visit window = \u00b1 1 day.  Day 15 and day 40 visit occur approximately 5 and 30 days \nafter the last dose respectively.  Day 15 window = \u00b1 1 day.  Day 40 window \u00b1 2 days.  \nh. Only weight to be assessed.  Height is not necessary at this visit.  Study drug is taken on day \n11, only if the first dose was taken after 4 PM on Day 1 [5.3] Subjects who are rapid diagnostic \npositive can be treated per standard of care.  They will be required to come for their follow-up \nvisits on day 15 and day 40.  \ni. \nSubjects who discontinue treatment prematurely will have an end of treatment (day 11) \nassessment at the time of treatment discontinuation or the following day.  They will be \nrequired to attend their follow up visits approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose (day 15 \nand day 40 assessments).  \nj. \nSubjects who discontinue during follow-up will have an end of follow-up (day 40) assessment.  \nThis visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.   \nk. For subjects who are unable to attend the clinic, swabs may be taken at home on those days where there \nis a home visit by site personnel. \nl. Plasma PK samples for assessment of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will be collected from \npatients who give additional consent to participate in PK sampling using a sparse PK sampling \napproach (Section 5.5).  \nm. Serial PK samples taken at steady-state no earlier than day 6 (i.e., not before the 11th dose) consisting of \nas many of the four timepoints as possible:  within 30 minutes prior to the dose administration, 1.5 \nhours \u00b1 30 minutes post dose, 4 hours \u00b1 60 minutes post dose, and 8 hours \u00b1 1.5 hours post dose (for \npatients who have given additional consent). \n  \n5.1 \nSCREENING EXAMINATION AND ELIGIBILITY SCREENING \nFORM  \nAll subjects must provide written informed consent (assent where applicable) before any \nstudy specific assessments or procedures are performed.  Screening will take place at \nthe baseline visit prior to first dose.  However, if necessary, screening may take place \nthe day before the baseline visit, as long as the patient is randomized and receives \nhis/her first dose of study medication within 96 hours of influenza symptom onset. \nSubjects will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria and those who fulfill all the \ninclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study.  \nAn Eligibility Screening Form [ESF] documenting the investigator\u2019s assessment of each \nscreened subject with regard to the protocol\u2019s inclusion and exclusion criteria is to be \ncompleted by the investigator. \nA screen failure log must be maintained by the investigator.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n34 \n \n5.2 \nPROCEDURES FOR ENROLLMENT OF ELIGIBLE SUBJECTS  \nOnce a subject has fulfilled the entry criteria, he/she will be randomized to one of two \ntreatment groups.  The subject randomization numbers will be generated by Roche or its \ndesignee and incorporated into double-blind labeling. \nThe investigator or designee will use the CRF pre-printed with the assigned subject \nnumber and enter the randomization number provided by IVRS for allocation to the \ntreatment groups in the appropriate place on each subject\u2019s CRF. \nRandomization will be stratified by transplant status (Yes; No); time between onset of \nsymptoms and treatment start ( \u2264 48 hrs or  > 48 hrs), influenza vaccination status (Yes; \nNo) and patient\u2019s age ( \u2264 12 years or  > 12 years).  \n5.3 \nCLINICAL ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES \nAt all visits subjects will receive the routine care for their primary illness.  Routine patient \ncare (including the adjustment of doses of any of the immunosuppressive drugs) will be \ndictated by tests performed locally at the trial site.  For subjects unable to attend the clinic, \nprovision will be made for swabbing to be conducted at home, when there is a home visit \nscheduled.  Training will be provided to site staff on how to perform this.  All safety labs will be \nsent to a central laboratory.  Results for these laboratory parameters will be used by the \nsponsor/designee to assess overall safety. \nAll assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of \nAssessments (Table 1).  Additional information regarding these procedures not provided \nin the Schedule of Assessments is provided below. \nBlood samples will be collected from patients who provide additional consent for PK sampling, as \noutlined in Section 5.5. \nStudy Day 1 \nThe baseline and study day 1 assessment may be performed at the same visit. \nStudy medication, electronic diaries, and thermometers will be dispensed.  Patients or \nguardians/parents will be instructed how to complete electronic symptom diaries \n(Appendix 2) (Appendix 3), temperature recording, and treatment administration details, \nincluding time of each oseltamivir dose.  The first diary entries will be made at the site \nbefore the first dose of study drug.  \nBaseline nasal and throat swab samples will be assessed for the presence of \noseltamivir-resistance mutations.   \nThe date of the first dose of study drug is defined as study day 1.  Once randomized, the \nfirst dose of study drug will be administered in the clinic.  Study day 2 will begin at 12 \nmidnight of the same calendar day.  If the first dose of study drug is taken after 4 pm on \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n35 \n \nday 1, the next dose of study drug will be taken in the morning of day 2.  In this case, the \nlast dose of study drug will be taken on the morning of study day 11.   \nIf the first dose of study drug is taken prior to 4 pm on day 1, the next dose of study drug \nshould be taken in the evening of the same day (i.e. prior to midnight on the same \ncalendar day with a minimum of 7 hours between doses).  For these patients the last \ndose of study drug will be taken in the evening of study day 10.  More information on \ndosing is provided later (Section 6.1). \nStudy Days 2 - 11 \nStudy day 2 will begin at 12 midnight of study day 1.  \nIt is expected the study staff will maintain close contact with patients, especially during \nthe first few days of the study.  The study staff should inquire about any adverse events, \ncheck that the patient or parent/guardian is entering data into the electronic diary \nproperly, and assess drug compliance.  During the dosing period, diary symptoms \nshould be assessed and temperature should be recorded at the same time that the study \ndrug is taken.  \nEnd of Treatment Day 11 \nThe end of treatment visit for all subjects is on day 11 (irrespective of whether they took \none or two doses on day 1).  Subjects who discontinue study medication prematurely will \nhave all day 11 assessments completed at the time of discontinuation or the following \nday.  \nAfter all day 11 study assessments are completed, a rapid diagnostic test will be \nperformed at this visit.  If the rapid diagnostic test is positive, the subject may be treated \nper standard of care at the discretion of the investigator.  \nAll subjects (including those who discontinue study medication prematurely and those \nwho are positive for influenza on their rapid diagnostic test at the end of treatment visit) \nwill be required to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose \n(day 15 and day 40 assessments).    \nStudy Days 12 \u2013 40 \nStudy day 15 is an important visit as it is the first assessment of viral culture after \ncessation of treatment.  \nEnd of Follow-Up Day 40  \nAll subjects must attend an end of follow-up visit on day 40.  \nIf the patient is withdrawn after completion of treatment (after the day 11 assessment), a \ntermination visit should be arranged.  This visit should be the end of follow-up visit \nassessment [Day 40].  This visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n36 \n \nPatients or parents/guardians who do not return to the clinic will be contacted by \ntelephone to ascertain their health status, or that of their child\u2019s, record information on \nadverse events, and to ask that they return the electronic diary. \n5.3.1 \nEfficacy Assessments \nThe primary efficacy end point in this study is the time to resolution of all influenza \nsymptoms as recorded in the patient diary.  \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \n1. \nSymptoms of influenza-like illness.  These are captured in the diary for both adults \nand children (Appendix 2) (Appendix 3).  Influenza symptoms are graded on a \nnominal scale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem).  A \nscore of zero is considered asymptomatic.  The primary efficacy end point, time to \nalleviation of all symptoms is comprised of all the symptoms captured in the diary.  \n2. \nTemperature.  This is captured in the diary.  Temperature is used for assessment of \nthe primary and several secondary efficacy end points.  \n \n5.3.2 \nSafety \nSafety parameters in this study include adverse events, vital signs, and clinical \nlaboratory evaluations.  \nPre-defined symptoms of influenza captured in the adult and pediatric diaries are not to \nbe reported as adverse events unless they can be further qualified.  Thus \u2018headache due \nto stress at work\u2019 is reported as an adverse event.  However, unexplained \u2018headache\u2019 is \nconsidered a predefined symptom related to influenza and not an adverse event.  \nAdverse events such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis are considered \nsecondary illnesses of influenza and should be recorded as adverse events. \nOther adverse events to be expected in the transplant population such as rejection and \ngraft versus host disease (in HSCT subjects) will also be collected as adverse events.  \n5.4 \nLABORATORY ASSESSMENTS \nThe laboratory assessments include those for efficacy and safety. \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza. \nThese are: \nNasal and throat swabs.  Two nasal and one throat swab will be collected as described \nin the Schedule of Assessments.  All swabs are sent to a central laboratory for RT-PCR \nand viral cultures.  Influenza virus shedding will be assessed.  Baseline samples will be \nassessed for the presence of oseltamivir-resistance mutations.   \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n37 \n \nDuring the course of treatment, neither the investigator nor the patient will know which \nparticipants have ongoing positive viral cultures for influenza.  At the end of treatment \n(day 11), a rapid diagnostic test is permitted for the diagnosis of ongoing influenza.  \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum \nchemistry and hematology will be done at the central laboratory.  Serum chemistry \nassessments comprise AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea and creatinine.  Hematology \nassessments include CBC and differential count.  The total volume of blood loss for \nlaboratory assessments will be approximately 20 mL for the entire duration of the study.  \nProtection of patient confidentiality (Section 16) will extend to any data generated from \nthe assaying of these samples.  Biological samples taken from all patients may be \ninfectious and will be classified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nThe Principal Investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be assessed at the \nlocal laboratory when clinically indicated during the study to calculate creatinine \nclearance. \n5.5 \nPHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS /PHARMACODYNAMIC \nASSESSMENTS  \nParticipation in PK assessments is not compulsory for this study.  Blood samples for the \ncharacterization of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics using a sparse \nsampling strategy will be collected from all patients who provide additional consent to participate \nin the PK assessments. \nBlood samples will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1) and as \ndescribed below.  If these blood samples are collected at a home visit, site staff should ensure the \nPK blood sample handling processing is not compromised.  The time and date of the dose and \nblood samples should be captured.  Further details on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics can \nbe found in Sections 8.3.1and 8.3.2.  \nPharmacokinetic Assessments\n5.5.1 \n \nPlasma PK samples for assessment of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will be collected at \nthe following timepoints on Day 6, or any day after the 11th dose, using the following sampling \napproach: \n\u2022 \nWithin 30 minutes prior to the dose administration (e.g., 08:30 a.m.) \n\u2022 \n1.5 hours \u00b1 30 minutes post-dose (e.g., 10:30 a.m. \u00b1 30 min) \n\u2022 \n4 hours \u00b1 60 minutes post dose (e.g., 1:00 p.m. \u00b1 60 min) \n\u2022 \n8 hours \u00b1 1.5 hours post dose (e.g., 5:00 p.m. \u00b1 1.5 hr) \n \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n38 \n \nFor adults and adolescents, approximately 2 mL of blood will be taken at each timepoint; therefore, \nthe total volume blood loss for PK assessments will be approximately 8 mL.  For pediatric subjects, \nnot less than approximately 0.6 mL of blood will be taken at each timepoint; therefore, the total \nvolume blood loss for PK assessments will be approximately 3.6 mL. \nThe samples from this study are classified as Biological Substance, Category B.  \nPlasma concentrations of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will be measured by a specific \nand validated method.  Details on sampling procedures, sample storage, and shipment are \nprovided in the Sampling Manual. \nPharmacodynamic Assessments\n5.5.2 \n \nNasal and throat swabs will be collected from individuals on the days specified in the schedule of \nassessments.  Specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  The proportion of patients with \nviral shedding at each visit will be summarized. \n6. \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \nThe Investigational Medical Product in this study is oseltamivir dry powder (to be \nreconstituted to a concentration of 12 mg/ml) or 75 mg capsules and matching placebo. \nThe Investigational Medicinal Products will be supplied, packaged individually for each \nsubject and labeled in accordance with Roche Standard and local regulation by Roche \nClinical Trial Supply, Basel, Switzerland.  \n6.1 \nDOSE AND SCHEDULE OF STUDY DRUG \nOseltamivir will be given twice daily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.  The doses \nneed to be taken at 12 hourly intervals.  Under no circumstances is a subject allowed to \ntake two doses within 7 hours of each other.  \nPatients will be randomized to receive either conventional or high dose of study drug. \nConventional dose: \nChildren ages 1 \u2212 12 years:  Oseltamivir syrup \n \u2264 15 kg   \n \n \n30 mg twice daily \n > 15 \u2212 23 kg   \n \n45 mg twice daily \n > 23 \u2212 40 kg  \n \n60 mg twice daily \n > 40 kg  \n \n \n75 mg twice daily \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

All \nparticipants 13 years and older will receive this dosage form.  Oseltamivir capsules \nshould be stored at 25\u00baC. \n2. \nA pediatric suspension containing 12 mg oseltamivir per ml of reconstituted solution \nand the following excipients:  sorbitol, titanium dioxide, sodium benzoate, xanthan \ngum, monosodium citrate, saccharin sodium and Permaseal11900-31 Tutti Frutti \n(flavor).  All participants 12 years and under will receive this dosage form.  \nOseltamivir dry powder for oral suspension [pediatric syrup] should be stored below \n30\u00b0C [86\u00b0F]).  Once reconstituted, the suspension should not be used for longer than \n10 days if stored under room temperature conditions (below 25\u00b0C) or for 17 days if stored \nunder refrigeration at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F).  The suspension is not suitable for freezing. \nFor further details, refer to the Tamiflu\u00ae Investigator\u2019s Brochure. \nMatching placebo will be available as capsules and suspension.  Subjects in the \nconventional dose arm will get the conventional dose and matching placebo so that they \nare blinded from the high dose arm.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n40 \n \nEach subject will be dispensed a medication pack that will provide enough medication to \ncover 20 doses.  For subjects randomized to the conventional dose arm, the medication \npack will contain a bottle of oseltamivir dry powder or a blister wallet with oseltamivir \ncapsules and matching placebo.  For subjects randomized to the high dose arm, the \nmedication pack will contain two bottles of oseltamivir dry powder or two blister wallets \nwith oseltamivir capsules.  Irrespective of the treatment group the subject is randomized \nto, for each dose the subject will take the same amount from both bottles or blister \nwallets provided in the medication pack such that the sum of the amounts from each \nimmediate container constitutes one dose. \nOne dose is to be administered twice per day at approximately 12-hour intervals with a \nlight snack or glass of milk or fruit juice.  The first dose of study medication will be \nadministered in the clinic at the time of randomization. \n6.3 \nBLINDING AND UNBLINDING \nRandomization will be administered by a central randomization center.  \nThe Randomization List will not be available at the study center, to the study monitors, \nproject statisticians or to the project team at Roche.  Emergency codes, or another \nadequate method of unblinding, will be implemented before study start, if the identity of \nthe test medication is necessary for patient management in the case of a serious \nadverse event.  Emergency codes should not be broken except in the case of \nemergency situations.  Any request from the investigator for information about the \ntreatment administered to study subjects for another purpose must be discussed with \nRoche/designee.  \nAs per regulatory reporting requirement, Roche/designee will unblind the identity of the \nstudy medication for all unexpected [as per IB] serious adverse events that are \nconsidered by the investigator to be related to study drug.  Details of patients who are \nunblinded during the study will be included in the Clinical Study Report. \nAll other individuals directly involved in this study will remain blinded until the final \nanalysis of the primary parameter.  \nThe randomization will be stratified by transplant status, duration of symptoms, influenza \nvaccination status and age and will be provided by the Roche randomization group for \nthe IVRS vendor.   \n6.4 \nASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE \nAccountability and subject compliance will be assessed by maintaining adequate \u201cdrug \ndispensing\u201d and return records.  \nSubjects will be asked to return all used and unused drug supply containers at the end of \nthe treatment as a measure of compliance.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n41 \n \nA Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should contain the following \ninformation: \n\u2022 \nthe identification of the subject [randomization and medication numbers] to whom \nthe study medication was dispensed \n\u2022 \nthe date[s], quantity of the study medication dispensed to the subject \n\u2022 \nthe date[s] and quantity of the study medication returned by the subject \n \nThis inventory must be available for inspection by the Monitor.  All supplies, including \npartially used or empty containers and the dispensing logs, must be returned to the \nmonitor at the end of the study. \n6.5 \nDESTRUCTION OF STUDY DRUG \nLocal or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used \ninvestigational product for safety reasons.  In these cases, it may be acceptable for \ninvestigational site staff to destroy dispensed investigational product before a monitoring \ninspection provided that source document verification is performed on the remaining \ninventory and reconciled against the documentation of quantity shipped, dispensed, \nreturned and destroyed.  Written authorization must be obtained from the sponsor or \ndesignee at study start up before destruction. \nWritten documentation of destruction must contain the following: \n\u2013 \nIdentity [batch numbers or subject numbers] of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 \nQuantity of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 \nDate of destruction \n\u2013 \nMethod of destruction \n\u2013 \nName and signature of responsible person [or company] who destroyed \ninvestigational products[s] \n7. \nSAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE \n7.1 \nADVERSE EVENTS (AES) AND LABORATORY \nABNORMALITIES \n7.1.1 \nClinical AEs \nPer the International Conference of Harmonization [ICH], an AE is any untoward medical \noccurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical \nproduct and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  \nAn AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign [including an abnormal \nlaboratory finding], symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a \nmedicinal [investigational] product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal \n[investigational] product.  Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study are to be \nreported as AEs.  Influenza signs and symptoms reported on the patient diary will be \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n42 \n \nsummarized as efficacy end points and need not be captured as adverse events.  \nHowever, secondary illnesses due to influenza must be reported as adverse events.  \n7.1.1.1 \nIntensity  \nAll clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of \nthe CRF.   \nIntensity of AEs will be graded on a four -point scale [mild, moderate, severe, \nlife-threatening] and reported in detail on the CRF.   \nMild \ndiscomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. \nModerate \ndiscomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity. \nSevere \ninability to work or perform normal daily activity \nLife Threatening \nrepresents an immediate threat to life   \n \n7.1.1.2 \nDrug - Adverse Event Relationship \nRelationship of the AE to the treatment should always be assessed by the investigator.  \nDescription of scales can be found in Appendix 4. \n7.1.1.3 \nSerious Adverse Events [Immediately Reportable to Roche] \nCertain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to \naddress potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report such events to the \nSponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours \nafter the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list of events that the investigator \nmust report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship \nto study drug: \n\u2022 \nSerious adverse events \n\u2022 \nPregnancies \n \nA Serious Adverse Event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect or precaution.  It is any AE that at any dose fulfils at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 \nis fatal; [results in death; NOTE:  death is an outcome, not an event].  \n\u2013 \nis Life-Threatening [NOTE:  the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer \nto an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more \nsevere]. \n\u2013 \nrequired in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 \nresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 \nis a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n43 \n \n\u2013 \nis medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \n \nThe full requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to \n(Appendix 5). \n7.1.2 \nTreatment and Follow-up of AEs  \nAEs, especially those for which the relationship to test \u201cdrug\u201d is not \u201cunrelated\u201d, should \nbe followed up until they have returned to baseline status or stabilized.  If a clear \nexplanation is established it should be recorded on the CRF.   \n7.1.3 \nLaboratory Test Abnormalities \nLaboratory test results will appear printed on laboratory reports provided to the site from \nthe central laboratory.  \nAny laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event [SAE] \nshould be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the CRF. \nAny treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result which is clinically significant, \ni.e., meeting one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded as a single \ndiagnosis on the AE page in the CRF: \n\u2022 \nAccompanied by clinical symptoms. \n\u2022 \nLeading to a change in study medication [e.g. dose modification, interruption or \npermanent discontinuation]. \n\u2022 \nRequiring a change in concomitant therapy [e.g. addition of, interruption of, \ndiscontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or \ntreatment]. \n \n7.1.4 \nFollow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values \nIn the event of medically significant unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the \ntests should be repeated and followed up until they have returned to the normal range \nand/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  If a clear explanation is \nestablished it should be recorded on the CRF.  \n7.2 \nHANDLING OF SAFETY PARAMETERS \nReporting of Serious Adverse Events [immediately reportable]\n7.2.1 \n \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious [as defined in \nSection 7.1.1.3 above] and which occurs during the course of the study, regardless of \nthe treatment arm, occurring from the enrollment visit (start of study screening \nprocedures), must be reported to Roche or designee immediately (i.e., no more than \n24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event [expedited reporting]). \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n44 \n \nRelated Serious Adverse Events MUST be collected and reported regardless of the time \nelapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  \nUnrelated Serious Adverse Events must be collected and reported during the study and \nup until the follow-up visit.  \nThe definition and reporting requirements of ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data \nManagement, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be \nadhered to (Appendix 5). \n7.2.2 \nPregnancy  \nA female subject must be instructed to stop taking the test \u201cdrug\u201d and immediately inform \nthe investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.  The investigator should \nreport all pregnancies immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator becomes \naware of the pregnancy) to the Sponsor or designee.  The investigator should counsel the \nsubject, and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects \non the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  \nPregnancies occurring within 28 days of treatment completion should be reported to \nRoche.  \n7.3 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \nEvents such as convulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of \nconsciousness, confusion, abnormal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, \nanxiety, nightmares) have been reported during oseltamivir use in patients with influenza, \npredominately in children and adolescents.  In rare cases, these events resulted in \naccidental injury.  The contribution of oseltamivir to those events is unknown.  Such \nevents have also been reported in patients with influenza who were not taking \noseltamivir.  Patients, especially children and adolescents, should be closely monitored \nfor signs of abnormal behavior. \nPlease refer to the attached Investigator\u2019s Brochure for additional warnings, precautions, \nand other reported adverse events. \n8. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN   \nFull details of all planned analyses will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis \nPlan (SAP) for the safety and efficacy variables and in the Resistance Plan for the \ndevelopment of resistance.  The methods described below are an outline of the main \nplanned analyses. \n8.1 \nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY STUDY ENDPOINTS \n8.1.1 \nPrimary Endpoints \nThe primary endpoints for safety will be assessments of adverse events, physical exams, \nvital signs and clinical laboratory evaluations.  The primary endpoint of development of \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n45 \n \nresistance will be determined from the genotypic and phenotypic variables measured \npost baseline and is described further in the Resistance Plan. \n8.1.2 \nSecondary Endpoints \nThe following are secondary endpoints which measure efficacy, the primary of which is \ntime to alleviation of all clinical symptoms.  With the exception of this variable, viral load \nand time to resolution of fever, they are defined as either the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of the specified events or the presence or absence of the specified \nsymptoms. \n\u2022 \nThe time (hours) to alleviation of all clinical influenza symptoms (recorded in the \npatient diary)  \n\u2022 \nShedding virus by culture at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15 and 40 \n\u2022 \nShedding virus by RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 \n\u2022 \nViral load by culture (log TCID /mL) at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40  \n10\n50\n\u2022 \nViral load by quantitative RT-PCR at day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15 and 40 \n\u2022 \nThe time (hours) from first dose of study medication until resolution of fever  \n\u2022 \nFever  \n\u2022 \nCough   \n\u2022 \nCoryza   \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis) \nat any time during the study \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis) \nat any time during the study that are treated with antibiotics \n\u2022 \nInitiation of treatment with antibiotics after randomization  \n\u2022 \nHospitalization, and for those who are hospitalized, the duration of hospitalization \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of rejection or GVHD \n \nThe following are the model-predicted PK secondary endpoints for both oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate: \n\u2022 \nSteady-state area under the concentration\u2013time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12) \n) for both oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate \n\u2022 \nMaximum plasma concentration (Cmax\n) for both oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate \n\u2022 \nTrough plasma concentration (Ctrough\n \nThe following model-predicted PK endpoints may be included, if appropriate:  \n\u2022 \nElimination half-life (t1/2) \n) \n\u2022 \nTime to maximum concentration (tmax\n) \n\u2022 \nElimination constant (ke\n\u2022 \nApparent clearance (CL/F) \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Subjects without alleviation of symptoms will have their time censored \nat the last available observation that a complete assessment was made. \nFor the purpose of comparing treatment groups, it will be assumed that their respective \ndistributions for the primary endpoint differ only by a shift in location. \n8.2.1.2 \nDichotomous Variables and Viral Load  \nFor the endpoints defined dichotomously in terms of events or symptoms including the \ndevelopment of resistance, it will be assumed that the number of patients experiencing \nthe event or exhibiting the symptom will have a binomial distribution. \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 no model will \nbe assumed.  \n8.2.2 \nSample Size \nThe sample size has been chosen to provide an adequate number of patients to \nestimate the development of resistance with reasonable precision.  Assuming that 90% \nof enrolled patients will have laboratory-confirmed influenza, there will be 75 patients in \neach treatment arm in the population evaluable for the development of resistance.  The \nfollowing table shows the 95% Pearson-Clopper confidence intervals that would result \nwith a sample size of 75 patients in a treatment arm if certain event rates are observed \nin the study. \nDuring the study the number of influenza A virus infected patients and the rate of \ndevelopment resistance will be monitored in a blinded fashion, in order to ensure a \nreasonable precision for the estimation.  An additional number of patients may be \nenrolled if necessary. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n47 \n \nObserved Rate (%) \n95% Confidence Interval \n0.0 \n  0%  - 4.8% \n1.3 \n0.0% - 7.2% \n2.7  \n0.3% - 9.3% \n5.3 \n1.5% - 13.1% \n10.7 \n4.7%-19.9% \n \nA total of 83 patients will be enrolled per arm and will be evaluable for the assessment of \nsafety.  This number of patients would provide estimates of adverse event rates with \nsimilar precision. \n8.2.3 \nHypothesis Testing  \nFormal hypothesis testing will be not performed, instead inferences will be based on \ncomparison of confidence intervals.  \n8.2.4 \nAnalysis Populations \nThree main patient populations will be used for the analysis of data from this study; the \nSafety Population, the Intent-to treat Population and the Intent-to-Treat Infected \nPopulation.  Detailed definitions of these populations will be given in the SAP.  \n8.2.4.1 \nIntent to Treat Population \nAll patients randomized will be included in the intent to treat population [Patients will be \nassigned to treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes]. \n8.2.4.2 \nIntent to Treat Infected Population \nAll patients randomized and with laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, excluding \npatients infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline, will be included in the \nintent to treat influenza infected population [Patients will be assigned to treatment groups \nas randomized for analysis purposes]. \nThe ITTI Population will be the primary population for the summary and analysis of the \ndevelopment of resistance and the efficacy variables. \n8.2.4.3 \n Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Patient Population (PKEP) \nThe PKEP population comprises all patients in the ITT population who have at least one post-\ndose drug concentration measurement at a scheduled visit timepoint.  Patients may be excluded \nfrom the PKEP population if they significantly violate the inclusion or exclusion criteria, deviate \nsignificantly from the protocol, or have unavailable or incomplete data that may influence the PK \nanalysis.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n48 \n \nDecisions on patient exclusion from the PK analysis will be made prior to database closure by the \nclinical pharmacologist.  Excluded patients will be documented along with the reason for \nexclusion. \n8.2.4.4 \nSubpopulations \nA subpopulation of the ITTI population will be defined comprising patients who received \ntheir first dose of study medication within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset for the \ncomparison of efficacy endpoints with the age appropriate placebo treated patients \n(pediatric or adult) from the registration trials. \nIn order to evaluate the potential for relapse, the following two subpopulations of the ITTI \npopulation will be evaluated:  \n\u2022 \npatients not shedding virus as assessed by culture on Day 11 \n\u2022 \npatients not shedding virus as assessed by RT-PCR on Day 11 \n \nViral shedding and RT-PCR at days 15 and 40 will be evaluated in these subpopulations. \nBased on the proportion of subjects hospitalized, an additional subpopulation may be \ndefined to evaluate the length of hospitalization for hospitalized subjects. \nLikewise, based on the proportion of children enrolled additional subpopulations of \nchildren and adults will be created to evaluate the course of influenza in children and \nadults.  \n8.2.5 \nEfficacy Analysis \nFor the analysis of time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms, the following two \nassessments will be made independently of each other and without regard to the \noutcomes in each case. \n\u2022 \nComparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials  \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment \napproval, a population of placebo treated patients will be established that is \ncomparable to the subpopulation of patients in the current study whose first dose of \nstudy medication was within 48 hours of symptom onset.  For this population, a \nmedian time to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms will be determined along \nwith its 95% confidence interval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.  These confidence intervals \nwill be compared individually to the placebo control confidence interval described \nabove as a potential means of establishing treatment effects. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n49 \n \n\u2022 \nAssessment of relative efficacy \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in \nthe median times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% \nconfidence interval.  \nThis confidence interval will provide lower and upper limits for the treatment difference \nand can be used as the basis for potential inferences.  For example, if it does not contain \nthe value zero a difference will have been established.   \nFor the dichotomous endpoints, the proportion experiencing the event or symptom, and \nits associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment group.  Where \npossible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control population will \nbe presented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment groups in this trial. \nThe continuous secondary endpoint time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint.  \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load (log TCID\n10\n50/mL) at Day 1, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40, \nsummary statistics (including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and \nmaximum) will be derived for each treatment group. \n8.2.6 \nSafety Data Analysis \nThe safety analysis population will include all subjects who receive at least one dose and \nhad a safety assessment performed post randomization.  All safety variables will be \nsummarized and presented in tables based on this safety population. \n8.2.7 \nAnalysis of Resistance \nFor the summary of the development of resistance for each treatment arm, 95% \nconfidence intervals will be provided with the estimated rates.  Further details are \navailable in the Resistance Plan for NV20234.  These data will be summarized in a \nreport separate from the final study report. \n8.2.7.1 \nExclusion of Data from Analysis \nEfficacy data collected from any patient who begins treatment with another antiviral for \ninfluenza (for example, amantadine, rimantadine, laninamivir, peramivir, or zanamavir), \nafter the other antiviral treatment commences, will be excluded from the primary and \nsecondary efficacy analyses.  Such patients will be considered failures to oseltamivir \ntreatment in the analyses.  Further details will be provided in the SAP. \n8.2.7.2 \nInterim Analysis \nNo interim analyses are planned.  \n8.2.8 \nOther Analyses \nFurther exploratory analysis (including assessments of the rapid diagnostic test, sub \ngroup analysis) will be detailed in the SAP. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n50 \n \n8.3 \nPHARMACOKINETIC AND PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSIS \nPharmacokinetic Analysis\n8.3.1 \n \nThe primary study variables are the model-predicted PK parameters:  steady-state AUC0-12, Cmax, \nand Ctrough of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. \nSecondary model-predicted PK variables may be included for both oseltamivir and oseltamivir \ncarboxylate, if appropriate:  t1/2, tmax, k , CL/F, Vc/F, CL\ne\nm, Clast and tlast. \nIndividual and mean plasma concentrations at each sampling timepoint for oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate will be presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics, \nincluding means, geometric means, medians, ranges, standard deviations, and coefficients of \nvariation.  Individual and mean concentration-versus-time profiles will be plotted on linear and \nsemi-logarithmic scales. \nPlasma concentration data from sparse sampling will be analyzed using an established population \nPK model to determine key exposure parameters (e.g., Cmax, Ctrough, and AUC).  For \nimmunocompromised children aged 1 to 18 years, plasma oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate \nconcentrations will be modeled in NONMEM using a structure similar to a comprehensive \npopulation PK model, which was previously developed using plasma data of \nnon-immunocompromised children and adults (ages 1 to 80 years) [36].  The basic structure \nconsists of a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and direct conversion of \noseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate, while a 1-compartment model is used to account for the \nrenal elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate from the plasma.  Body weight, evaluated using a \npower function and centered around 70 kg, is a statistically significant predictor of the CL/F for \noseltamivir, and both CL/F and central volume of distribution (Vc/F) for oseltamivir carboxylate.  \nFor oseltamivir carboxylate, CrCl is also a significant predictor of CL/F, while Vc/F decreases \nlinearly with age. \nPharmacodynamic Analysis  \n8.3.2 \nIf feasible, the relationship between PK exposure of oseltamivir carboxylate and viral shedding \nresponse data will be characterized using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (using software \nNONMEM).  Relevant population pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters will be derived, and the \ninfluence of covariates will be investigated.  If deemed appropriate and necessary, data may be \npooled with data from previous studies investigating oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in \norder to improve the model stability. \n9. \nDATA QUALITY ASSURANCE \nThe overall procedures for quality assurance of clinical study data are described in the \nRoche Standard Operational Procedures. \nAccurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross\u2013check of \nthe CRFs against the investigator\u2019s records by the study monitor [source document \nverification], and the maintenance of a drug\u2013dispensing log by the investigator.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n51 \n \nThe data collected will be entered into the study database from the working copy of the \nCRF faxed from the site. \nA comprehensive validation check program will verify the data and discrepancy reports \nwill be generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator.  As patients complete the \nstudy [or prematurely withdraw] and their signed CRFs become available, a second data \nentry will be performed from the original, signed CRF.  A comparison check will be run to \nidentify and resolve any discrepancies between the first and second data entry. \nThroughout the study the Study Management Team [SMT] will review data according to \nthe SMT Data Review Plan as described in the Data Quality Plan.  \n9.1 \nASSIGNMENT OF PREFERRED TERMS AND ORIGINAL \nTERMINOLOGY \nFor classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by the sponsor to the \noriginal terms entered on the CRF, using the current version of MedDRA (Medical \nDictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology) for adverse events and diseases and \nthe INN (International Non-Proprietary name) drug terms and procedures dictionary for \ntreatments and surgical and medical procedures. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n55 \n \nPART II: ETHICS AND GENERAL STUDY ADMINISTRATION \n11. \nETHICAL ASPECTS \n11.1 \nLOCAL REGULATIONS/DECLARATION OF HELSINKI \nThe investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformance with the \nprinciples of the \u201cDeclaration of Helsinki\u201d or with the laws and regulations of the country \nin which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the \nindividual.  The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in \u201cGuideline for Good \nClinical Practice\u201d ICH Tripartite Guideline [January 1997] or with local law if it affords \ngreater protection to the subject.  For studies conducted in the EU/EEA countries, the \ninvestigator will ensure compliance with the EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC].  For \nstudies conducted in the USA or under US IND, the investigator will additionally ensure \nthat the basic principles of \u201cGood Clinical Practice\u201d as outlined in the current version of \n21 CFR, subchapter D, part 312, \u201cResponsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators\u201d, part \n50, \u201cProtection of Human Subjects\u201d, and part 56, \u201cInstitutional Review Boards\u201d, are \nadhered to. \nIn other countries where \u201cGuideline for Good Clinical Practice\u201d exist Roche and the \ninvestigators will strictly ensure adherence to the stated provisions. \n11.2 \nINFORMED CONSENT  \nIt is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator [if \nacceptable by local regulations], to obtain written informed consent from each subject \nparticipating in this study, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated \nbenefits, and potential hazards of the study.  For subjects not qualified or incapable of \ngiving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legally acceptable \nrepresentative.  In the case where both the subject and his/her legally acceptable \nrepresentative are unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the \nentire informed consent discussion.  After the subject and representative have orally \nconsented to participation in the trial, the witness\u2019 signature on the form will attest that \nthe information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood.  The \ninvestigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are completely free to refuse \nto enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason.  The Case Report \nForms [CRFs] for this study contain a section for documenting informed subject consent, \nand this must be completed appropriately.  If new safety information results in significant \nchanges in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and \nupdated if necessary.  All subjects [including those already being treated] should be \ninformed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form and give their consent \nto continue in the study. \nIf children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the study, they should \nalso be informed and should also provide their written consent. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n56 \n \n11.3 \nINDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEES/INSTITUTIONAL \nREVIEW BOARD  \nIndependent Ethics Committees [non-US]:  This protocol and any accompanying \nmaterial provided to the subject [such as subject information sheets or descriptions of \nthe study used to obtain informed consent] as well as any advertising or compensation \ngiven to the patient, will be submitted by the investigator to an Independent Ethics \nCommittee.  Approval from the committee must be obtained before starting the study, \nand should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the \ncommittee met and granted the approval. \nAny modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the Independent Ethics \nCommittee approval must also be submitted by the investigator to the Committee in \naccordance with local procedures and regulatory requirements. \nWhen no local review board exists, the investigator is expected to submit the protocol to \na regional committee.  If no regional committee exists, Roche will assist the investigator \nin submitting the protocol to the European Ethics Review Committee. \nInstitutional Review Board [US]:  It is the understanding of the sponsor that this \nprotocol [and any modifications] as well as appropriate consent procedures, will be \nreviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board.  This board must operate in \naccordance with the current Federal Regulations.  A letter or certificate of approval will \nbe sent by the investigator to the Sponsor or designee prior to initiation of the study, and \nalso whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made. \n12. \nCONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL \nProtocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between \nan appropriate representative of the sponsor and the investigator [investigator \nrepresentative[s] in the case of a multicenter trial].  Protocol modifications must be \nprepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially reviewed and approved by the \nClinical Science Leader/Clinical Pharmacologist and Biostatistician. \nAll protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Independent Ethics \nCommittee or Institutional Review Board for information and approval in accordance with \nlocal requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required.  Approval must be awaited \nbefore any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an \nimmediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the change[s] involves only logistical or \nadministrative aspects of the trial [e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone \nnumber[s]. \n13. \nCONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY \nBoth the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  \nShould this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual study \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n57 \n \nbasis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, Roche and the investigator \nwill assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient\u2019s interests. \n14. \nSTUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS AND RECORD KEEPING \n14.1 \nINVESTIGATOR'S FILES / RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS \nThe Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of \nthe study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These \ndocuments should be classified into two different separate categories [1] Investigator's \nStudy File, and [2] subject clinical source documents. \nThe Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, Case Report and \nQuery Forms, Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and \ngovernmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, \nstaff curriculum vitae and authorization forms and other appropriate \ndocuments/correspondence etc.  \nSubject clinical source documents [usually defined by the project in advance to record \nkey efficacy/safety parameters independent of the CRFs] would include patient \nhospital/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original \nlaboratory reports, ECG, EEG, X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed \ninformed consent forms, consultant letters, and subject screening and enrollment logs.  \nThe Investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least 15 \nyears after completion or discontinuation of the study.  After that period of time the \ndocuments may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.  \nShould the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them \nto another location, Roche must be notified in advance. \nIf the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site \nfor any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the \nInvestigator and Roche to store these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that \nthey can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where \nsource documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies \nshould be made for storing outside of the site. \n14.2 \nSOURCE DOCUMENTS AND BACKGROUND DATA \nThe investigator shall supply the sponsor or designee on request with any required \nbackground data from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly \nimportant when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are suspected.  In \ncase of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, \nit is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that patient \nconfidentiality is protected. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n58 \n \n14.3 \nAUDITS AND INSPECTIONS \nThe investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made \navailable to appropriately qualified personnel from the Roche Pharma Development \nQuality Assurance Unit or its designees, or to health authority inspectors after \nappropriate notification.  The verification of the CRF data must be by direct inspection of \nsource documents. \n14.4 \nCASE REPORT FORMS \nFor each patient enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal \ninvestigator or authorized delegate from the study staff.  This also applies to records for \nthose patients who fail to complete the study [even during a pre-randomization screening \nperiod if a CRF was initiated].  If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be \nnoted on the CRF.  If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment-\nlimiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. \nAll forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink, and must be legible.  Errors \nshould be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change \ninitialed and dated by the investigator or his/her authorized delegate.  The investigator \nshould ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported \nto the sponsor or designee in the CRFs and in all required reports. \n15. \nMONITORING THE STUDY \nIt is understood that the responsible Roche monitor [or designee] will contact and visit \nthe investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the various records \nof the trial [CRFs and other pertinent data] provided that patient confidentiality is \nmaintained in accord with local requirements. \nIt will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout \nthe study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and \naccuracy of the data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to \nlaboratory test reports and other patient records needed to verify the entries on the CRF.  \nThe investigator [or his/her deputy] agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that \nany problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. \n16. \nCONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT \nRECORDS \nThe investigator must assure that subjects\u2019 anonymity will be maintained and that their \nidentities are protected from unauthorized parties.  On CRFs or other documents \nsubmitted to the sponsor or designee, subjects should not be identified by their names, \nbut by an identification code.  The investigator should keep a subject enrollment log \nshowing codes, names and addresses.  The investigator should maintain documents not \nfor submission to Roche, e.g., subjects\u2019 written consent forms, in strict confidence. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version D \n59 \n \n17. \nPUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE \nSECRETS \nThe results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is \nforeseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Roche prior to \nsubmission.  This allows the sponsor or designee to protect proprietary information and \nto provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be \navailable to the investigator. \nIn accord with standard editorial and ethical practice, Roche will generally support \npublication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In \nthis case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. \nAny formal publication of the study in which input of Roche personnel exceeded that of \nconventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and \nthe appropriate Roche personnel.  Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

An AE may be considered probable, if: \n3. \nIt follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n4. \nIt cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject\u2019s \nclinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered \nto the subject. \n5. \nIt disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  [There are important \nexceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet \ndrug-relatedness clearly exists; e.g., [1] bone marrow depression, [2] tardive \ndyskinesias]. \n6. \nIt follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n7. \nIt reappears upon rechallenge. \n \nPOSSIBLE [must have first two] \n1. \nThis category applies to those AEs in which the connection with the test drug \nadministration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.

This was removed to prevent \nambiguity around which patients should not be enrolled into this clinical protocol, \nsince patients on antibiotics or with other secondary infections are not allowed to be \nenrolled.  Removal of this criterion is not expected to impact the benefit-risk profile \nof NV20234 as high-risk patients suspected of having influenza would receive \noseltamivir as part of their clinical care (as per WHO guidance) and these data are \navailable through various publications. \n\u2022 \nReference to patient electronic diary cards and to all uses of paper diaries in \nemergency situations were removed \n\u2022 \nThe total PK blood volume for pediatric patients was corrected from 3.6 mL to \n2.4 mL \n\u2022 \nAppendices 2 and 3 have been updated to include an example of the current patient \ndiary text \n\u2022 \nUpdated emergency medical call-in information in Appendix 5 \n\u2022 \nAdded  Child-Pugh Classification  \n \nAdditional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  \nSubstantive new information appears in italics.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n2 \n \nPROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION E \nSUMMARY OF CHANGES \nGLOBAL CHANGES \nThroughout the protocol high dose was changed to double dose to more accurately \nreflect the  dose amount.  Pharmacokinetic assessment reference to oseltamivir was \nremoved as only oseltamivir carboxylate is evaluated in plasma samples.  The term \nmedication was changed to drug to better identify which medication and all references to \nelectronic diary were changed to patient diary.  References were added as appropriate \nfrom newly added text. \nPROTOCOL SYNOPSIS \nThe protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where \napplicable. \nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS OF TERMS \nThe list of abbreviations and definitions of terms has been updated to reflect the \nchanges to the protocol, where applicable. \nSECTION 1.1.1:  Influenza in the Immunodeficient Population\nSecondary immunodeficiency due to disease \nHIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ T-cell count of  < 200/mm \u03bc\n3 L (AIDS defining) are \nhighly susceptible to opportunistic disease [16].  However, CD4 counts < 500/mm \u03bc\n3 L are \nconsidered abnormal in HIV-infected individuals, and therefore these individuals are also \nmore susceptible to infection.  CD4+T cell counts are higher in infants and young \nchildren than in adults and decline over the first few years of life [40, 41].  because of \nthis age-dependent variation in absolute CD4+ T cell count, calculation of CD4 \npercentage is used as a measure for young children because it has shown less variability.  \nHIV-infected children (12 months to 5 years old) with < 15% CD4+ T cells are classed \nas severely immunosuppressed and highly susceptible to opportunistic disease, although \nantiretroviral therapy is recommended in children with  < 25% CD4+ T cells as they are \nstill classified as immunosuppressed [42].  Studies in patients with HIV/AIDS  have \nshown an increased risk for heart and lung-related hospitalizations during the influenza \nseason compared with other times of the year, prolonged duration of influenza \nsymptoms, increased risk for influenza-related complications and a higher risk of \ninfluenza-related death [17]. \nSECTION 2.2:  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and high double dose oseltamivir in \nimmunocompromised patients on: \n\u2022 \nThe population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate (e.g., clearance, \nvolume of distribution) in immunocompromised patients with confirmed influenza infection, \nthrough the application of established population pharmacokinetic (PK) models to the sparse \nplasma concentration data generated  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n3 \n \n\u2022 \nThe virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different time \npoints) \n\u2022 \nThe virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntime points). \n\u2022 \nTo estimate the population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir \ncarboxylate (e.g., clearance, volume of dstribution) in immunocompromised patients \nwith confirmed influenza infection, through the application of established population \npharmacokinetic (PK) models to the sparse plasma concentration data generated. \n\u2022 \nTo explore the relationship of metrics of exposure (e.g. AUC, Cmin) to relevant \npharmacodynamic  (PD) endpoints \n \nSECTION 3.1.1.1:  Choice of Treatment Arms\nThe currently approved dose of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is the \nconventional dose with a duration of 5 days.  In this study a conventional and high double \ndose (twice the conventional dose) are being evaluated.  The pivotal registration trials for \noseltamivir in healthy adults with influenza had three treatment arms, two active (75 mg \nand 150 mg) and one placebo.  Both treatment arms were found to be significantly better \nthan placebo.  No statistical comparisons were made between the two active treatment \narms.  Evaluation of the results in the two active treatment arms did not reveal any \nclinically meaningful difference.  However, the proportion of patients shedding virus on \nDay 4 (3 days after the start of treatment), suggested a possible dose-response \nrelationship (36%, 28% and 23% in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg dose arms \nrespectively).  Because defective immune-mediated virus clearance in \nimmunosuppressed patients treated with antivirals can result in a higher incidence of \nselection of drug-resistant viruses, it was decided to use both the conventional and high \ndouble dose arm for this study. \nSECTION 3.1.1.2:  Inclusion of Patients Symptomatic up to 96 Hours\nIn immunocompromised patients, time from onset of symptoms to seeking medical \nattention (presentation at the clinic) of  > 48 hours has been shown in several case \nreports [33, 27, 28,29] including two instances of nosocomial outbreaks in children \n[25,20].  This notwithstanding, oseltamivir has been shown to offer benefitbe effective in \nimmunocompromised populations that included patients treated with oseltamivir beyond \n48 hours of presentation; patients with lung transplant (median time to presentation 3 \ndays) [27], bone marrow transplant (treatment started more than 48 hours after onset of \nsymptoms in all 3 patients) [25], organ transplant (62 of 221 patients started treatment \nafter 96 hours) [26] and children with ALLacute lymphocytic leukemia (one child \npresented after 3 days and two children presented after 5 days of symptoms) [21]. \nSECTION 3.1.1.4:  Interpretation of Study Results\nSafety and tolerability and the development of resistance are the primary objectives of \nthis study.  These will be characterized descriptively.  For the secondary objective of \nefficacy, the subset of the population enrolled in the first 48 hours will be compared with \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n4 \n \nplacebo patients from pivotal registration trials (where patients were enrolled in the first \n2 days of illness).  Sections 8.2.5, 8.2.6, and 8.2.7 provide details on the statistical \nconsiderations and their rationale associated with these comparisons. \nSECTION 3.1.2:  Rationale for Dose Selection and Adjustment \nDose Selection \nThus, the rationale for the double higher dose arm in this study is to explore the \npossibility of improved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance without an \nundue increase in risk.  For patients with a creatinine clearance level of 45 mL/min or above, \noseltamivir carboxylate exposures for both the 75-mg and 150-mg doses are not expected to exceed \nexposures previously tested.  Patients with a creatinine clearance as low as 45 ml/min, who \nreceive the 150-mg BID dose, will have exposures of oseltamivir carboxylate that are within \n(albeit in the upper end) the established safety margin. This corresponds to an AUC produced by \nthe 450 mg BID dose in adults with normal renal function (AUC 0-12 hrs of  approximately 15,000 \nng \u2022 hr/mL). \nDose Adjustments \nAs this is a double blind In this study, patients whose creatinine clearance (CrCl) decreases \nto  < 60mL45mL/min (adults) using the Cockcroft-Gault method or <45mL/min/1.73m2 (<18 \nyears old) using the Schwartz equation will be discontinued from study treatment.  A lower \nlimit of 45 mL/min for creatinine clearance will be used to allow for patients with a mild to \nmoderate renal impairment.  \n \nSECTION 3.1.3:  End of Study\nThe study comprises 10 days of treatment with follow-up visits approximately 5 and 30 \ndays later as shown in the schedule of assessments.  Study medication will be \nadministered twice daily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.  A rapid diagnostic test for \ninfluenza will be performed at the end of the 10 days of treatment.  Patients still having \ninfluenza based on the rapid diagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care \nby the principal investigator, and any medication provided during the follow-up period should \nbe captured in the CRF. \nSECTION 4.2:   INCLUSION CRITERIA\n\u2022 \nImmunocompromised patient defined as one who meets any of the following: \no Primary immunodeficiency at risk for viral infections (representative \nexamples in Appendix 6) OR \no Secondary immunodeficiency \n\ufffd \nSOT with ongoing immunosuppression OR \n\ufffd \nAllogenic HSCT with ongoing immunosuppression OR \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

A lower limit of 45 mL/min for creatinine clearance will be \nused to allow for patients with a mild to moderate renal impairment.   \nSECTION 5.1: SCREENING EXAMINATION AND ELIGIBILITY SCREENING \nFORM\nPatients will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria and those who fulfill all the \ninclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study.  Influenza \nRapid Diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture for the purposes of inclusion criteria \nfulfillment will be done by the site or the local laboratory.  Historical CrCl values \nwithin 3 months and CD4+ T-cell counts (where applicable) within 6 months before \nrandomization are acceptable for inclusion into the study.  \nSECTION 5.3:  CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES\nStudy Day 1 \nThe baseline and study Day 1 assessment may be performed at the same visit.  \nLaboratory assessments (safety labs and nasal and throat swabs for virology) should be performed \nafter randomization but prior to the patient receiving first dose of study drug. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n6 \n \nStudy medication, electronic drug, patient diaries, and thermometers will be dispensed.  \nPatients or guardians/parents will be instructed on how to complete electronic symptom \nthe patient diaries (Appendix 2 andAppendix 3), temperature recording, and treatment  \nEnd of Treatment Day 11 \nThe end of treatment visit for all patients is on Day 11 (irrespective of whether they took \none or two doses on Day 1).  Study medication will be administered twice daily over 10 days \nfor a total of 20 doses.  Patients who discontinue study medicationdrug prematurely will \nhave all Day 11 assessments completed at the time of discontinuation or the following \nday.  \nAfter all Day 11 study assessments are completed, a rapid diagnostic test will be \nperformed at this visit.  If the rapid diagnostic test is positive, the patient may be treated \nper standard of care at the discretion of the investigator.  If treatment is provided, this \nshould be captured in the CRF.  \nStudy Days 12 \u2013 40 \nStudy Day 15 is an important visit as it is the first assessment of viral culture after \ncessation of treatment.  It is therefore important that this visit is completed.  \n \nSECTION 5.3.1:  Efficacy Assessments\nThe primary efficacy end point in this study is the time to resolution of all influenza \nsymptoms as recorded in the patient diary.  \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \n1. \nSymptoms of influenza like illness.  These are captured in the patient diary for both \nadults and children (Appendix 2) (Appendix 3).  Influenza symptoms are graded on \na nominal scale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem).  A \nscore of zero is considered asymptomatic.  The primary efficacy end point, time to \nalleviation of all symptoms is comprised of all the symptoms captured in the patient \ndiary.  \n2. \nTemperature.  This is captured in the patient diary.  Temperature is used for \nassessment of the primary and several secondary efficacy end points.  \n \nSECTION 5.3.1:  Safety\nSafety is one of the primary end-points of this study.

Influenza symptoms are graded on a \nnominal scale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem).  A score of \nzero is considered asymptomatic.  The efficacy end point, time to alleviation of all \nsymptoms is comprised of all the symptoms captured in the patient diary.  \n2. Temperature.  This is captured in the patient diary.  Temperature is used for assessment \nof several efficacy endpoints. \nSECTION 5.4:  LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS\nThe laboratory assessments include those for efficacy and safety, resistance, and efficacy. \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum chemistry and \nhematology, will be carried out at a central laboratory.  Serum chemistry assessments comprise \nAST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea and creatinine.  Hematology assessments include CBC and \ndifferential count.  The total volume of blood loss for laboratory assessments will be \napproximately 20 mL for the entire duration of the study.  \nProtection of patient confidentiality (Section16) will extend to any data generated from the assay \nof these samples.  Biological samples collected from all patients may be infectious and will be \nclassified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nWhen clinically indicated, the investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be assessed at \nthe local laboratory  during the study to calculate creatinine clearance. \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza. \nThese are: \nNasal and throat swabs.  Two nasal and one throat swab will be collected as described \nin the Schedule of Assessments.  All swabs are sent to a central laboratory for RT-PCR \nand viral cultures.  Influenza virus shedding will be assessed.  Baseline samples will be \nassessed for the presence of oseltamivir resistance mutations.   \nDuring the course of treatment, neither the investigator nor the patient will know which \nparticipants have ongoing positive viral cultures for influenza.  At the end of treatment \n(dayDay 11), a rapid diagnostic test is permitted for the diagnosis of ongoing influenza.  \nSafety \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

For pediatric patients, not less than approximately 0.6 mL of blood \nwill be collected at each timepoint; therefore, the total volume blood loss for PK \nassessments will be approximately 3.62.4 mL \nSECTION 5.5.2:  Pharmacodynamic Assessments\nNasal and throat swabs will be collected from individuals on the days specified in the \nschedule of assessments.  Specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  As \nimmunocompromised patients are expected to shed virus for a longer duration, viral samples will \nbe collected at all visits.  The proportion of patients with viral shedding at each visit will be \nsummarized \nSECTION 6.2:  PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF STUDY DRUG\n1. \nOseltamivir capsules containing 75 mg of active drug and packaging material \nconsisting of pregelatinized starch, povidone, talc and sodium stearyl fumarate.

The serious adverse events should be reported in the most \nup -to-date version of the SAE form. \nSECTION 7.2.2:  Pregnancy\nA female patient must be instructed to stop taking the test \u201cdrug\u201d and immediately inform \nthe investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.  The investigator should \nreport all pregnancies immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator \nbecomes aware of the pregnancy) to the Sponsor or designee, using the most up -to-\ndate version of the pregnancy form. \nSECTION 8:  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN\nFor continuous endpoints summary statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, \nminimum and maximum will be derived for each treatment group. For categorical data the \nnumber and percentage of events and/or patients for each treatment group will be presented. \nSECTION 8.1.1:  Primary Endpoints\nThe primary endpoints for safety will be descriptive assessments of:  \n\u2022 \nAdverse events \n\u2022 \nPhysical examinations,  \n\u2022 \nVital signs and  \n\u2022 \nClinical laboratory evaluations  \n\u2022 \nTissue rejection and/or graft versus host disease in transplant patients \n\u2022 \n \nSECTION 8.1.2:  Secondary Endpoints\nThe following endpoints will be analyzed descriptively at relevant timepoints The following are \nsecondary endpoints which measure efficacy, the primary of which is time to alleviation \nof all clinical symptoms.  With the exception of this variable, viral load and time to \nresolution of fever, they are defined as either the occurrence or non occurrence of the \nspecified events or the presence or absence of the specified symptoms. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n11 \n \nLikewise, based on the proportion of children enrolled additional subpopulations of \nchildren and adults will be created to evaluate the course of influenza in children and \nadults.  \nEfficacy Analysis \nFor the analysis of time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms, the following two \nassessments will be made independently of each other and without regard to the \noutcomes in each case. \nComparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials  \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment approval, \na population of placebo treated patients will be established that is comparable to the \nsubpopulation of patients in the current study whose first dose of study medicationdrug \nwas within 48 hours of symptom onset.  For this population, a median time to resolution \nof all clinical influenza symptoms will be determined along with its 95% confidence \ninterval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.  These confidence intervals will \nbe compared individually to the placebo control confidence interval described above as a \npotential means of establishing treatment effects. \nAssessment of relative efficacy \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in the \nmedian times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% confidence \ninterval.  \nThis confidence interval will provide lower and upper limits for the treatment difference \nand can be used as the basis for potential inferences.  For example, if it does not contain \nthe value zero a difference will have been established.   \nFor the dichotomous endpoints, the proportion experiencing the event or symptom, and \nits associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment group.  Where \npossible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control population will \nbe presented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment groups in this trial. \nThe continuous secondary endpoint time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for the \nprimary efficacy endpoint.  \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load (log10TCID50/mL) at Day 1, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40, \nsummary statistics (including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and \nmaximum) will be derived for each treatment group. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

All \nsafety variables will be summarized and presented in tables based on this safety \npopulation: \n\u2022 \nAdverse events \n\u2022 \nPhysical examination \n\u2022 \nVital signs \n\u2022 \nClinical laboratory evaluations \n\u2022 \nRejection and/or graft versus host disease \nSECTION 8.2.7:  Efficacy Analysis\nFor the analysis of time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms, the following two assessments \nwill be made independently of each other and without regard to the outcomes in each case. \n\u2022 \nComparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials  \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment approval, a \npopulation of placebo treated patients will be established that is comparable to the \nsubpopulation of patients in the current study whose first dose of study drug was within 48 \nhours of symptom onset.  For this population, a median time to resolution of all clinical \ninfluenza symptoms will be determined along with its 95% confidence interval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.   \n\u2022 \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in the \nmedian times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% confidence interval.  \nFor the dichotomous endpoints, the proportion of patients experiencing the event or symptom, \nand its associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment group.  Where \npossible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control population will be \npresented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment groups in this trial. \nThe continuous secondary endpoint time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for the time to \nalleviation of all symptoms. \nSECTION 8.2.8:  Other Analyses\nFurther exploratory analyses (including assessments of the rapid diagnostic test, sub \ngroup analysis) will be detailed in the SAP \nSECTION 8.3.1:  Pharmacokinetic Analysis\nThe primary study variables are the model-predicted derived PK parameters:  steady-\nstate AUC0-12, Cmax, and Ctrough of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n13 \n \nSecondary model predicted PK variables may be included for both oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate, if appropriate:  t1/2, tmax, ke, CL/F, Vc/F, CLm, Clast and tlast. \nPlasma concentration data from sparse sampling will be analyzed using an established \npopulation PK model to determine key exposure parameters (e.g., Cmax, Ctrough, and \nAUC).  For immunocompromised children aged 1 to 18 years, plasma oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate concentrations will be modeled in NONMEM using a structure \nsimilar to a comprehensive population PK model, which was previously developed using \nplasma data from non-immunocompromised children and adults (ages 1 to 80 years) \n[36].  The basic structure consists of a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption \nand direct conversion of oseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate, while a 1-compartment \nmodel is used to account for the renal elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate from the \nplasma.  Body weight, evaluated using a power function and centered around 70 kg, is a \nstatistically significant predictor of the CL/F for oseltamivir, and both CL/F and central \nvolume of distribution (Vc/F) for oseltamivir carboxylate.  For oseltamivir carboxylate, \nCrCl is also a significant predictor of CL/F, while Vc/F decreases linearly with age. \nSECTION 8.3.2:  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis\nIf feasible, exposure-response relationships [43]will be evaluated between independent variables \nof exposure (e.g., AUC, Cmin) and  dependent variables including continuous (area under the \nviral titer curve, and peak viral titer) and time-to-event (cessation of viral shedding) virologic \nendpoints. Exploratory PK/PD analyses will be performed using appropriate methodologies. In \norder to account for potential non-linearity and non-monotonicity, each continuous independent \nvariable (e.g., AUC) will be evaluated in its original form, as a categorical variable based on \nquartiles, as two- and three-group categorical variables.the relationship between PK exposure \nof oseltamivir carboxylate and viral shedding response data will be characterized using \nnonlinear mixed effects modeling (using software NONMEM).  Relevant population \npharmacodynamic (PD) parameters will be derived, and the influence of covariates will \nbe investigated.  If deemed appropriate and necessary, data may be pooled with data \nfrom previous studies investigating oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in order to \nimprove the model stability\nTABLE 1:  Schedule of Assessments \nTable 1 has been revised to remove reference to the electronic patient diary and testing \nby RIDT PCR/ Culture for confirmation of influenza virus was added. \nAPPENDIX 2:  Patient Diary Data and Symptom Record for Adults \nAppendix 2 has been revised to reflect the changes to the protocol. \nAPPENDIX 3:  Patient Diary Data and Symptom Record for Children \nAppendix 3 has been revised to reflect the changes to the protocol. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n27 \n \nPART I: STUDY DESIGN AND CONDUCT \n1. \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n1.1 \nBACKGROUND \nInfluenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by a virus of the orthomyxovirus family \nwhich occurs in three forms, influenza A, B and C.  Influenza virus types A and B cause \nan acute febrile infection of the respiratory tract characterized by the sudden onset of \nfever, malaise, headaches, myalgias and cough.  Influenza causes numerous deaths \neach year [1].  Although difficult to assess, annual influenza epidemics are thought to \nresult in between three and five million cases of severe illness, and between 250,000 \nand 500,000 deaths every year around the world [2]. \nThe influenza viruses are segmented, negative sense, single stranded, lipid \nencapsulated, RNA viruses between 80 and 100 nm in size.  Subtypes are defined \naccording to glycoproteins present in the viral lipid coat.  The haemagglutinin complex \n(HA) is the major surface protein of the virus.  The neuraminidase (NA) proteins are the \nsecond major surface proteins in the virion and play a role in enhancing virus penetration \nof the mucus layer around the target cell and in release of virus from the cell surface.  \nThe M2 protein triggers the disintegration of the virion during virus entry into the cell and \nmay also be involved in protecting the HA prior to assembly of new virus particles.  \n1.1.1 \nInfluenza in the Immunodeficient Population \nInfluenza infection is usually a self\u2212limiting condition.  However, in children, the elderly \nand the immunocompromised, influenza infection can be associated with substantial \nmorbidity and mortality [1].  In patients with compromised immunity, influenza virus may \ncause severe lower respiratory tract involvement; unusual syndromes, including \nencephalitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis and death [3].   \nConditions that compromise immunity may be classified based on etiology into primary \n(genetic) and secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency.  Of the immunodeficient \nconditions, the ones that affect cell mediated immunity are likely to have adverse \noutcomes following viral infections [16]. \nPrimary immunodeficiency  \nPrimary immunodeficiencies are relatively common, may be either congenital or manifest \nlater in life and are classified according to whether the genetic defect affects T or B cells \nor both [16].  There are four groups of disorders: severe combined immunodeficiency \n(SCID), primary T cell deficiency (e.g. CD8 deficiency, DiGeorge syndrome), \npredominantly B-cell-related antibody deficiency (e.g. common variable \nimmunodeficiency, selective IgA deficiency) and other well-defined immunodeficiency \nsyndromes (e.g., Wiskott Aldrich syndrome) [16].  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n28 \n \nOf the primary immunodeficiencies, antibody deficiencies are the most frequent.  \nHowever, some of the more common antibody deficiency conditions (isolated IgA \ndeficiency, IgG subclass deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency) have intact \ncell-mediated immunity and therefore the clinical course of viral infections (unless \ncomplicated by bacterial infections) does not differ significantly from that in the normal \nhost [16].  A list of primary immunodeficiency disorders at risk for viral infections is \nprovided in Appendix 6.  The incidence of some of these conditions has been estimated.  \nThe incidence of SCID is 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 [16].  The more severe forms of \nprimary immunodeficiency are relatively rare, have their onset early in life, and all too \nfrequently result in death during childhood [16].  \nSecondary Immunodeficiency \nSecondary immunodeficiencies are not caused by intrinsic abnormalities in development \nof T and B cells [16].  Secondary immunodeficiency may result from diseases (human \nimmunodeficiency virus [HIV], hematologic malignancy) or immunosuppressive and \ncytotoxic drugs (such as those used for treatment of transplant recipients, collagen \nvascular disease, malignancies).  \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to disease \nHIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ T-cell count of  < 200/mm3 (AIDS defining) are \nhighly susceptible to opportunistic disease [\n].  However, CD4 counts < 500/mm\n16\n3 are \nconsidered abnormal in HIV-infected individuals, and therefore these individuals are also \nmore susceptible to infection.  CD4+T cell counts are higher in infants and young \nchildren than in adults and decline over the first few years of life [40 ,41].  Because of \nthis age-dependent variation in absolute CD4+ T cell count, calculation of CD4 \npercentage is used as a measure for young children because it has shown less variability.  \nHIV-infected children (12 months to 5 years old) with < 15% CD4+ T cells are classed \nas severely immunosuppressed and highly susceptible to opportunistic disease, although \nantiretroviral therapy is recommended in children with  < 25% CD4+ T cells as they are \nstill classified as immunosuppressed [42].  Studies in patients with HIV/AIDS have \nshown an increased risk for heart and lung-related hospitalizations during the influenza \nseason compared with other times of the year, prolonged duration of influenza \nsymptoms, increased risk for influenza-related complications and a higher risk of \ninfluenza-related death [17]. \nSeveral hematologic malignancies affect the immune system (Appendix 7).  Several \nauthors have reported influenza in children and adults with hematologic malignancies \n[18, 19, 20, 21].  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n29 \n \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to drugs (e.g. transplant recipients, collagen \nvascular disease, malignancies) \nThe enhanced survival of the transplant population following the availability of newer \nimmunosuppressive drugs has made them representative of the immunocompromised \npopulation in general; and secondary immunodeficiency due to drugs, in particular. \nIn transplant recipients influenza is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary \ncomplications, extrapulmonary manifestations and an increased risk of graft dysfunction \nand high attributable mortality.  In a cohort study of influenza viral infection in solid organ \ntransplant (SOT) patients, 30 cases of influenza viral infection were identified.  \nSecondary bacterial pneumonia was seen in 17% of patients and three SOT recipients \n(2 liver and one kidney) had myositis, myocarditis and bronchiolitis obliterans.  Biopsy of \nthe transplanted organ was performed in 21 of 30 cases and revealed variable degrees \nof acute allograft rejection in 62% of patients.  The study concluded that influenza was \nassociated with significant morbidity in different groups of SOT recipients [4]. \nAmong transplant recipients, patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) \nare at the greatest risk for morbidity.  In a prospective study from the Infectious Diseases \nWorking Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, 1973 \npatients were evaluated for respiratory virus infections after stem cell transplantation.  \nThe overall mortality was 23% from influenza A infection and the direct influenza A-\nassociated mortality was 15.3% in this study [5].  A large retrospective study \n(4797 patients undergoing HSCT over a 13-year period) identified 62 patients with \ninfluenza of whom as many as 29% (18 of 62 patients) developed pneumonia.  Ten \npercent of the patients with influenza died [6].  \nThe increased morbidity in transplant patients is associated with increased duration of \nvirus shedding compared to that in healthy subjects.  In otherwise healthy adults, elderly \npatients and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated patients was 70, \n96 and 118 hours respectively [7].  In contrast, in the retrospective HSCT study, \ninfluenza virus was shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a \nmedian duration of 168 hours (7 days, range 2 to 37 days) [6]. \nCurrently available treatments for influenza infection are the M2 ion channel inhibitors \n(e.g. amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir, \nzanamivir).  \n1.1.2 \nOseltamivir \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Ro 64-0796) is an ethyl ester prodrug which is rapidly absorbed \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and metabolized in the liver by \nhigh capacity carboxylesterases to form oseltamivir carboxylate (Ro 64-0802), a potent, \nstable and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes.  The active \nform, oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted unchanged by the kidney via glomerular \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n30 \n \nfiltration and active tubular secretion by the organic anion transport system.  The efficacy \nand safety of oseltamivir in influenza treatment and prevention has been established in \nan extensive series of clinical studies in man. \nOseltamivir has been approved for the treatment of influenza in Europe, the United \nStates and most other countries around the world.  In adults and adolescents, the \nrecommended dose is 75 mg twice daily for five days.  In children 1 year of age and \nolder recommended doses are 30, 45 or 60 mg bid based on body weight.  In all age \ngroups the recommended dose is administered bid for 5 days.   \nThe approval of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza is based on several controlled \nclinical trials.  In the pooled population from these clinical trials encompassing adults \naged from 13-97 years, many with significant co-morbidity, 1325 patients were treated \nwith oseltamivir (75 mg bid) and 1056 patients received placebo.  A total of seven \ninfluenza symptoms (both respiratory and constitutional) were captured on the diary card \nfor adults.  The time to resolution of all symptoms (on the diary card) decreased by \n24 hours; from 124.5 hours in the placebo arm to 100.6 hours with oseltamivir 75 mg bid \n(p  < 0.0001) [7].  Further, in adults and adolescents with a proven influenza illness, \noseltamivir treatment reduced overall antibiotic use for any reason by 26.7% and the \nincidence of influenza-related lower respiratory tract complications resulting in antibiotic \ntherapy by 55%.  The study concluded that oseltamivir treatment of influenza reduces \nlower respiratory tract complications, antibiotic use and hospitalizations in healthy and \u2018at \nrisk\u2019 patients [8].   \nLikewise, in the influenza-infected pediatric population (1 to 12 years of age), oseltamivir \ntreatment (n = 217) was compared with placebo (n = 235).  There was a reduction in the \nmedian duration of illness (defined based on resolution of temperature, cough, coryza \nand return to pre-illness health and activity) of 36 hours; from 137 hours with placebo to \n101 hours in the oseltamivir treatment arm (p \u2264 0.0001).  The Canadian Acute \nRespiratory Infections Scale (CARIFS), validated for use in children, was used to collect \nsymptom data on the pediatric diary card.  The CARIFS scale comprised a total of 18 \nsymptoms which were evaluated twice daily by the parent or guardian.  There was a \nsimilar reduction in the time to alleviation of all CARIFS symptoms of 36 hours; from 100 \nhours in the placebo group to 63 hours in the oseltamivir group (p < 0.0001) [9].  \nThus in both adults and children, the time to resolution of all symptoms was significantly \nreduced in the oseltamivir treatment arm compared with placebo.   \nOseltamivir was well-tolerated in clinical trials.  Approximately 11,000 patients have \nreceived oseltamivir in the development program.  The most common adverse events \nreported by adults, the elderly, and children were nausea and vomiting.  Serious adverse \nevents (SAEs) were reported with a low and equal frequency by patients taking active \ndrug and placebo.  Full details are given in the Investigator Brochure [7]. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n31 \n \nThe safety profile of oseltamivir has been well characterized for the prophylaxis \nindication in a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial conducted in the adult \nand pediatric immunocompromised (HSCT and SOT) population.  In the oseltamivir \ngroup, the indications for transplant included hematologic malignancies (acute and \nchronic leukemias, multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome), lymphoid \nmalignancies (Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphomas), primary immunodeficiencies \n(Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease and severe combined \nimmunodeficiency).  Other rare indications included bone marrow aplasia, paroxysmal \nnocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelofibrosis and multiple sclerosis.  In the safety population, \nthere were 239 patients randomized to the conventional dose of oseltamivir and 238 to \nplacebo.  The total number of adverse events reported in the placebo group (361 events) \nwas generally similar to that in the oseltamivir group (323 events).  Diarrhea was the \nmost frequently reported adverse event (placebo, 8%; oseltamivir, 6%).  There were no \ndeaths in the oseltamivir group.  Oseltamivir was found to be safe in immunosuppressed \ntransplant recipients [22]. \nLimited safety and/or efficacy of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is available from \nseveral case reports in children and adolescents.  Oseltamivir was shown to be safe \nand/or effective in HIV infected children (n = 10) [23], children (age 3 to 12 years) with \nacute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n = 10) [21], in a nosocomial H1N1 outbreak in a \npediatric (children aged 10 months to 13 years) oncology ward (n = 8) [20], in children \nand adolescents (age 2 to 19 years) with malignancies (ALL, neuroblastoma, brain \ntumor, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myelodysplasia, acute \nmyeloid leukemia (AML), Wilms tumor, aplastic anemia, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) \nand acute promyelocytic leukemia) (n = 51) [18], in children aged 4 to 14 years on \nimmunosuppressive drugs (n = 5) [24] and in children (aged 5 months to 5 years) with \nbone marrow transplant (n = 3) [25].  \nOseltamivir has also been shown to be safe and/or effective in mixed populations of \nchildren and adults (62 patients) with HSCT [6], and in a large epidemiologic study \n(n = 221) with SOT [26].  \nFinally, oseltamivir has been shown to be safe and/or effective in immunocompromised \nadults with HSCT [10] and adults with lung transplant [27, 28, 29].  \nThe dose of oseltamivir was the same as the conventional dose in a majority of these \nreports.  In one report as many as 25 adult patients received twice the conventional dose \n[26] while in another report, three of nine adult patients received twice the conventional \ndose [29].  Treatment with oseltamivir generally ranged from 5 to 10 days [28, 29, 26] \nand occasionally until the patient was symptom free [28, 29].  In exceptional cases \ntreatment was given for as long as 20 days [18] or for as long as the patient was positive \nby RT-PCR [21]. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n32 \n \nThere is some concern about the development of resistance in the immunocompromised \npopulation.  During the pandemic influenza season, more than 23,000 clinical isolates of \nnovel H1N1 pandemic virus were tested for resistance in the 6 international WHO \nregions.  A total of 225 isolates (from 225 patients) were resistant (H275Y mutation in \nthe neuraminidase coding sequence) to oseltamivir for an approximate incidence of 1%.  \nInformation on immune status was available for 142 of 225 patients.  Among the 142 \npatients, 56 (40%) were immunocompromised [30].  Prolonged viral replication and lack \nof immune-mediated virus clearance in immunosuppressed patients treated with \nantivirals can result in a higher incidence of selection of drug-resistant viruses, a \nphenomenon that has been documented previously [31, 32].  \n1.2 \nRATIONALE FOR THE STUDY  \nBecause of the increasing body of evidence (Section 1.1.2), oseltamivir is recommended \nin national guidelines as an option for the treatment of influenza in the transplant \npopulation [37], which comprises a significant portion of the immunocompromised \npopulation.  However, there is limited data on safety and efficacy of oseltamivir use in \nthis population.  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and resistance, \nwhile evaluating efficacy as a secondary objective, in the broader immunocompromised \npatient population, who are considered at increased risk of viral infection. \n2. \nOBJECTIVES  \n2.1 \nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE \nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate prospectively the safety and tolerability \nof oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients and \ncharacterize the effects of oseltamivir in immunocompromised patients on the \ndevelopment of resistant influenza virus. \n2.2 \nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES   \nThe secondary objectives of the study are:  \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and double dose oseltamivir in \nimmunocompromised patients on: \n\u2022 \nThe population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir carboxylate (e.g., clearance, volume of \ndistribution) in immunocompromised patients with confirmed influenza infection, through \nthe application of established population pharmacokinetic (PK) models to the sparse plasma \nconcentration data generated  \n\u2022 \nThe virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different time \npoints) \n\u2022 \nThe time to resolution of influenza symptoms \n\u2022 \nThe clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis)  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n33 \n \n\u2022 \nTo explore the relationship of metrics of exposure (e.g., AUC, Cmin) to relevant \npharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints \n \n3. \nSTUDY DESIGN \n3.1 \nOVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND DOSING REGIMEN   \nThis is a double blind, randomized, stratified, multi-center trial of conventional and double \ndose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients.  \nImmunocompromised patients, who develop an influenza-like illness with a positive rapid \ndiagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture for influenza, will be enrolled during the influenza \nseason.  Patients will be stratified by transplant status [yes, no], the time between onset \nof influenza symptoms and treatment start (up to 96 hours) [ \u2264 48 hours; > 48 hours], \ninfluenza vaccination status for current influenza season [Yes; No] and by age \n[ \u2264 12 years; > 12 years].  Eligible patients will be consented and randomized to receive \noseltamivir twice daily for 10 days in one of two treatment arms:  conventional dose or \ndouble dose (double the conventional dose).  \n3.1.1 \nRationale for Study Design \nThis study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo \ncontrolled trials.  \nThere is no placebo control arm in this study as it was considered unethical for this high \nrisk population.  The development of resistance following treatment with oseltamivir (one \nof the primary objectives of the study) is an objective assessment (determined by \nlaboratory tests) and is unlikely to be impacted by the absence of a placebo arm.  \nAs a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this population, an alternative \ncontrol arm had to be identified for efficacy end points.  The response to placebo in \npivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was \nchosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial.  In order to do this, the \nend points were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal registration trials.  \nThe following sections provide rationale and justification for specific aspects of the study \ndesign which differ from the currently approved dosing for influenza or from previous \npivotal registration trials.  They also provide information on how the results will be used \nto make recommendations on dose and duration of treatment. \n3.1.1.1 \nChoice of Treatment Arms \nThe currently approved dose of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is the \nconventional dose with a duration of 5 days.  In this study a conventional and double \ndose are being evaluated.  The pivotal registration trials for oseltamivir in healthy adults \nwith influenza had three treatment arms; two active (75 mg and 150 mg) and one \nplacebo.  Both treatment arms were found to be significantly better than placebo.  No \nstatistical comparisons were made between the two active treatment arms.  Evaluation \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n34 \n \nof the results in the two active treatment arms did not reveal any clinically meaningful \ndifference.  However, the proportion of patients shedding virus on Day 4 (3 days after \nthe start of treatment), suggested a possible dose-response relationship (36%, 28% and \n23% in the placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg dose arms respectively).  Because defective \nimmune-mediated virus clearance in immunosuppressed patients treated with antivirals \ncan result in a higher incidence of selection of drug-resistant viruses, it was decided to \nuse both the conventional and double dose arm for this study.  A longer duration of \ntreatment was chosen because a large retrospective study has shown that the median \nduration of viral shedding of 7 days [6] was greater for HSCT recipients than that seen in \nthe healthy children, adult and elderly population with influenza (Section 1.1.1) [7].  \n3.1.1.2 \nInclusion of Patients Symptomatic up to 96 Hours \nIn immunocompromised patients, time from onset of symptoms to seeking medical \nattention (presentation at the clinic) of  > 48 hours has been shown in several case \nreports [33, 27, 28, 29] including two instances of nosocomial outbreaks in children [25, \n20].  This notwithstanding, oseltamivir has been shown to offer benefit in \nimmunocompromised populations that included patients treated with oseltamivir beyond \n48 hours of presentation; patients with lung transplant (median time to presentation 3 \ndays) [27], bone marrow transplant (treatment started more than 48 hours after onset of \nsymptoms in all 3 patients) [25], organ transplant (62 of 221 patients started treatment \nafter 96 hours) [26] and children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (one child presented \nafter 3 days and two children presented after 5 days of symptoms) [21]. \nIn a prospective, observational study involving adults hospitalized with influenza, the \nstudy authors concluded that \u2018Weakened host defenses slow viral clearance, whereas \nantivirals started within the first four days of illness enhance viral clearance\u2019 [34].  \nAdditionally, in November 2009, in a communication for clinicians on antiviral treatments \nfor H1N1, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that while \nantiviral treatment is most effective when started early; both outpatients with risk factors \nand hospitalized patients still benefit when treatment with oseltamivir is started more \nthan 48 hours after illness onset [35].   \n3.1.1.3 \nRational for Sparse PK Sampling \nLimited PK sampling will be done in this protocol, in patients who have provided \nadditional consent, and is justifiable in this study for the following two reasons: \n36\n\u2022 \nThere are already tested and qualified population PK models available [\n] that will \nbe used to estimate exposure in the immunocompromised population on the basis \nof the data collected in this study, meaning extensive PK sampling over a steady-\nstate dosing interval is not required.  \n\u2022 \nThe patient population in this study is likely to be very ill with a complex clinical \npicture and significant additional burden of treatment and monitoring due to their \nprimary condition.  In this context, it makes ethical sense to minimize blood draws \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n35 \n \nand assessments to only those absolutely essential to meet the objectives of the \nstudy and to ensure patient safety. \n \n3.1.1.4 \nInterpretation of Study Results  \nSafety and tolerability and the development of resistance are the primary objectives of \nthis study.  These will be characterized descriptively.  For the secondary objective of \nefficacy, the subset of the population enrolled in the first 48 hours will be compared with \nplacebo patients from pivotal registration trials (where patients were enrolled in the first \n2 days of illness).  Section 8.2.5 , Section 8.2.6 , and Section 8.2.7  provide details on \nthe statistical considerations. \nStratification \nStratification in this study has no bearing on any comparisons with results from previous \ntrials.  However, in order to evaluate a dose response relationship between the two \nactive treatment arms in this trial, stratification remains essential.  \nPatients will be stratified by transplant status (yes, no) because transplant patients form \na relatively large homogenous group in this study and might influence outcome.  \nPatients will be stratified by time between onset of symptoms and treatment start \n( < 48 hours or \u2265 48 hours) because previous experience in otherwise healthy adults and \nchildren has shown that patients treated early in their illness respond to treatment better \nthan those who are treated later.  Patients will also be stratified by age ( \u2264 12 years \nand > 12 years) because otherwise healthy children shed virus longer than otherwise \nhealthy adults.  It is expected that a similar difference in the duration of viral shedding \nwould exist between immunocompromised children and adults.  As vaccinated patients \nmay respond faster to therapy, the study is also stratified based on influenza vaccination \nstatus for the current influenza season (Yes; No).  \n3.1.2 \nRationale for Dose Selection and Adjustment \nDose Selection \nThe dose of oseltamivir to be used in this study is the conventional, approved dose for \nchildren and adults in the treatment of influenza.  There will be a second higher dose for \ncomparison which is two times the conventional dose.  This higher dose is used based \non theoretical considerations which suggest that the higher dose may be associated with \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance.  \nThe anticipated pro-drug and metabolite exposures from this higher dose are not \nexpected to exceed maximum exposures seen previously in the oseltamivir development \nprogram.  The safety and tolerability of the higher dose regimen has already been \ndemonstrated in treatment studies of immunocompetent adult subjects (n =  447) [11].  In \na study to demonstrate cardiac safety, in the highest dose group treated with 450 mg \nBID. for 5 days [n =  99], no subject had a serious adverse event, nor withdrew \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n36 \n \nprematurely.  In Phase I studies in adults, oseltamivir has been administered in multiple \ndoses of up to 500 mg BID.  Doses of 200 mg BID. and greater have been associated \nwith increased gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) [7].  In adult \nsubjects with creatinine clearances of \u2264 30 mL/min, doses of 100 mg BID for 6 days \nwere well tolerated, despite steady-state oseltamivir carboxylate exposures \napproximately 10-fold higher than those achieved with standard dosing in renally \ncompetent individuals [12].  No other adverse effects were reported more frequently with \nhigher doses and no serious adverse events have been reported within the volunteer \nstudies.  Co-administration of oseltamivir with food has been demonstrated to \nsubstantially reduce the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal side effects.  \nThus, the rationale for the double dose arm in this study is to explore the possibility of \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance without an undue increase in \nrisk.  For patients with a creatinine clearance level of 45 mL/min or above, oseltamivir \ncarboxylate exposures for both the 75-mg and 150-mg doses are not expected to exceed exposures \npreviously tested.  Patients with a creatinine clearance as low as 45 mL/min, who receive the \n150-mg BID dose, will have exposures of oseltamivir carboxylate that are within (albeit in the \nupper end) the established safety margin. This corresponds to an AUC produced by the 450-mg \nBID dose in adults with normal renal function (AUC 0-12 hrs of approximately 15,000 ng \u2022 hr/mL).  \nDrug interactions with immunosuppressive medications have also been evaluated.  The \npharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate after administration of \n75 mg oseltamivir (conventional adult dose) in patients with a well-functioning, stable \nrenal allograft who were being maintained on immunosuppressive therapy were studied.  \nThese were similar to those described in the literature for adults with comparable \ndegrees of renal function.  Oseltamivir was well tolerated and had no clinically relevant \neffect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or \nmycophenolate mofetil [7]. \nDuration of Dosing \nThe duration of dosing chosen for this population (10 days) is longer than that in the \nhealthy adult and pediatric populations (5 days).  This is based on observations that the \nviral shedding and illness are typically longer in immunocompromised patients than it is \nin healthy adults [6, 10]. \nDose Adjustments \nAs this is a double blind study, patients whose creatinine clearance (CrCl) decreases \nto  < 45mL/min (adults) using the Cockcroft-Gault method or <45 mL/min/1.73m2 (<18 years \nold) using the Schwartz equation will be discontinued from study treatment.  A lower limit of \n45 mL/min for CrCl will be used to allow for patients with a mild to moderate renal impairment.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n37 \n \n3.1.3 \nEnd of Study \nThe study comprises 10 days of treatment with follow-up visits approximately 5 and \n30 days later as shown in the schedule of assessments.  Study medication will be \nadministered BID over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.  A rapid diagnostic test for influenza will \nbe performed at the end of the 10 days of treatment.  Patients still having influenza \nbased on the rapid diagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care by the \nprincipal investigator, and any medication provided during the follow-up period should be \ncaptured in the CRF.  \n3.2 \nNUMBER OF PATIENTS/ ASSIGNMENT TO TREATMENT \nGROUPS \nA minimum of 166 patients (approximately 83 per arm) to allow an adequate number of \ninfluenza A patients, including 50 transplant recipients will be enrolled in this study.  After \nscreening, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two active treatment groups. \n3.3 \nCENTERS \nThis will be a multicenter study taking place in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres \nat approximately 125 centers.  \n4. \nSTUDY POPULATION \n4.1 \nOVERVIEW \nThe study population comprises immunocompromised adults (including adolescents) \nand children who have influenza.  Additionally, the patients must not have other medical \nconditions that will preclude the assessment of efficacy or safety.  Influenza vaccinated \nand non-vaccinated patients are eligible to participate in this study.  Principal \ninvestigators will review oseltamivir resistance patterns of strains circulating in the area \nand weigh the risk versus the benefit before enrolling patients with a potentially resistant \nstrain. \nUnder no circumstances are patients who enroll in this study permitted to be re-\nrandomized to this study and enrolled for a second course of treatment. \n4.2 \nINCLUSION CRITERIA \n\u2022 \nAge greater than or equal to 1 year \n\u2022 \nRapid diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture positive for influenza \n\u2022 \nImmunocompromised patient defined as one who meets any of the following: \no Primary immunodeficiency at risk for viral infections (representative \nexamples in Appendix 6) OR \no Secondary immunodeficiency \n\ufffd \nSOT with ongoing immunosuppression OR \n\ufffd \nAllogenic HSCT with ongoing immunosuppression OR \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Live attenuated vaccines may not be advisable for this population.  It is \npossible that concurrent use with oseltamivir may render live vaccines ineffective.  \nMedications required for the routine care of the patient may be continued during the \nstudy.  Concomitant use of probenecid (irrespective of the indication) is not allowed \nduring the study. \n4.5 \nCRITERIA FOR PREMATURE WITHDRAWAL  \nThe investigator must discontinue treatment if the creatinine clearance is  < 45 mL/min in \nadults using the Cockcroft-Gault method or < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Schwartz \nequation in children.  A lower limit of 45 mL/min for creatinine clearance will be used to allow \nfor patients with a mild to moderate renal impairment.  The investigator must also \ndiscontinue treatment from all patients with intercurrent illnesses or adverse events \nsuggestive of hepatic decompensation.  The investigator also has the right to \ndiscontinue treatment in the event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, treatment \nfailure, protocol violations, administrative reasons or other reasons. \nThe investigator must discontinue treatment with study drug if the patient is to be treated \nconcomitantly with another antiviral for influenza, for example, amantadine, rimantadine, \nlaninamivir, peramivir, or zanamavir.  However, all patients, including those who \ndiscontinue study drug prematurely and/or are treated with another antiviral, will be \nrequired to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose of study \ndrug (Day 15 and Day 40 assessments). \nPatients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n40 \n \nAn excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, \nunnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  Should a patient decide to \nwithdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations prior to \nwithdrawal as thoroughly as possible. \nThe investigator should contact the patient or a responsible relative either by telephone \nor through a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the \nwithdrawal.  A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient\u2019s withdrawal should be \nmade with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing from the study.  If the reason \nfor removal of a patient from the study is an Adverse Event, the principal specific event \nwill be recorded on the CRF. \nIn the case that the patient decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment [\u201crefuses \ntreatment\u201d], he/she should be asked if he/she can still be contacted for further \ninformation.  The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical \nrecords and in the CRF.  \n4.6 \nREPLACEMENT POLICY [ENSURING ADEQUATE NUMBERS \nOF EVALUABLE PATIENTS] \n4.6.1 \nFor Patients \nNo patient prematurely discontinued from the study for any reason will be replaced. \n4.6.2 \nFor Centers \nA center may be replaced for the following administrative reasons:   \n\u2013 \nExcessively slow recruitment. \n\u2013 \nPoor protocol adherence. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

They will be required to come for their \nfollow-up visits on Day 15 and Day 40.  \ni. \nPatients who discontinue treatment prematurely will have an end of treatment (Day 11) \nassessment at the time of treatment discontinuation or the following day.  They will be \nrequired to attend their follow up visits approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose \n(Day 15 and Day 40 assessments).  \nj. \nPatients who discontinue during follow-up will have an end of follow-up (Day 40) assessment.  \nThis visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.   \nk. For patients who are unable to attend the clinic, swabs may be taken at home on those days \nwhere there is a home visit by site personnel. \nl. \nPlasma PK samples for assessment of oseltamivir carboxylate will be collected from patients \nwho give additional consent to participate in PK sampling using a sparse PK sampling \napproach (Section 5.4).  \nm. Serial PK samples taken at steady-state no earlier than Day 6 (i.e., not before the 11th dose) \nconsisting of as many of the four timepoints as possible:  within 30 minutes prior to the dose \nadministration, 1.5 hours \u00b1 30 minutes post dose, 4 hours \u00b1 60 minutes post dose, and \n8 hours \u00b1 1.5 hours post dose (for patients who have given additional consent). \n  \n5.1 \nSCREENING EXAMINATION AND ELIGIBILITY SCREENING \nFORM  \nAll patients must provide written informed consent (assent where applicable) before any \nstudy specific assessments or procedures are performed.  Screening will take place at \nthe baseline visit prior to first dose.  However, if necessary, screening may take place \nthe day before the baseline visit, as long as the patient is randomized and receives \nhis/her first dose of study drug within 96 hours of influenza symptom onset. \nPatients will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria and those who fulfill all the \ninclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study.  Influenza \nRapid Diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture for the purposes of inclusion criteria \nfulfillment will be done by the site or the local laboratory.  Historical CrCl values \nwithin 3 months and CD4+ T-cell counts (where applicable) within 6 months before \nrandomization are acceptable for inclusion into the study.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n43 \n \nAn Eligibility Screening Form [ESF] documenting the investigator\u2019s assessment of each \nscreened patient with regard to the protocol\u2019s inclusion and exclusion criteria is to be \ncompleted by the investigator. \nA screen failure log must be maintained by the investigator.  \n5.2 \nPROCEDURES FOR ENROLLMENT OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS  \nOnce a patient has fulfilled the entry criteria, he/she will be randomized to one of two \ntreatment groups.  The patient randomization numbers will be generated by Roche or its \ndesignee and incorporated into double-blind labeling. \nThe investigator or designee will use the CRF pre-printed with the assigned patient \nnumber and enter the randomization number provided by IVRS for allocation to the \ntreatment groups in the appropriate place on each patient\u2019s CRF. \nRandomization will be stratified by transplant status (Yes; No); time between onset of \nsymptoms and treatment start ( \u2264 48 hrs or  > 48 hrs), influenza vaccination status \n(Yes; No) and patient\u2019s age ( \u2264 12 years or  > 12 years).  \n5.3 \nCLINICAL ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES \nAt all visits patients will receive the routine care for their primary illness.  Routine patient \ncare (including the adjustment of doses of any of the immunosuppressive drugs) will be \ndictated by tests performed locally at the trial site.  For patients unable to attend the \nclinic, provision will be made for swabbing to be conducted at home, when there is a \nhome visit scheduled.  Training will be provided to site staff on how to perform this.  All \nsafety labs will be sent to a central laboratory.  Results for these laboratory parameters \nwill be used by the sponsor/designee to assess overall safety. \nAll assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of \nAssessments (Table 1).  Additional information regarding these procedures not provided \nin the Schedule of Assessments is provided below. \nBlood samples will be collected from patients who provide additional consent for PK \nsampling, as outlined in Section 5.5 . \nStudy Day 1 \nThe baseline and study Day 1 assessment may be performed at the same visit.  \nLaboratory assessments (safety labs and nasal and throat swabs for virology) should be performed  \nafter randomization but prior to the patient receiving first dose of study drug. \nStudy drug, patient diaries, and thermometers will be dispensed.  Patients or \nguardians/parents will be instructed on how to complete the patient diaries (Appendix 2) \nand(Appendix 3), temperature recording, and treatment administration details, including \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n44 \n \ntime of each oseltamivir dose.  The first diary entries will be made at the site before the \nfirst dose of study drug.  \nBaseline nasal and throat swab samples will be assessed for the presence of \noseltamivir-resistance mutations.   \nThe date of the first dose of study drug is defined as study Day 1.  Once randomized, \nthe first dose of study drug will be administered in the clinic.  Study Day 2 will begin at \n12 midnight of the same calendar day.  If the first dose of study drug is taken after 4 pm \non Day 1, the next dose of study drug will be taken in the morning of Day 2.  In this case, \nthe last dose of study drug will be taken on the morning of study Day 11.   \nIf the first dose of study drug is taken prior to 4 pm on Day 1, the next dose of study drug \nshould be taken in the evening of the same day (i.e. prior to midnight on the same \ncalendar day with a minimum of 7 hours between doses).  For these patients the last \ndose of study drug will be taken in the evening of study Day 10.  More information on \ndosing is provided later (Section 6.1). \nStudy Days 2 - 11 \nStudy Day 2 will begin at 12 midnight of study Day 1.  \nIt is expected the study staff will maintain close contact with patients, especially during \nthe first few days of the study.  The study staff should inquire about any adverse events, \ncheck that the patient or parent/guardian is entering data into the patient diary properly, \nand assess drug compliance.  During the dosing period, diary symptoms should be \nassessed and temperature should be recorded at the same time that the study drug is \ntaken.  \nEnd of Treatment Day 11 \nThe end-of-treatment visit for all patients is on Day 11 (irrespective of whether they took \none or two doses on Day 1).  Study medication will be administered twice daily over 10 days \nfor a total of 20 doses.  Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will have all \nDay 11 assessments completed at the time of discontinuation or the following day.  \nAfter all Day 11 study assessments are completed, a rapid diagnostic test will be \nperformed at this visit.  If the rapid diagnostic test is positive, the patient may be treated \nper standard of care at the discretion of the investigator.  If treatment is provided, this \nshould be captured in the CRF.  \nAll patients (including those who discontinue study drug prematurely and those who are \npositive for influenza on their rapid diagnostic test at the end of treatment visit) will be \nrequired to return for follow up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose (Day 15 \nand Day 40 assessments).    \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n45 \n \nStudy Days 12 \u2013 40 \nStudy Day 15 is an important visit as it is the first assessment of viral culture after \ncessation of treatment.  It is therefore important that this visit is completed.  \nEnd of Follow-Up Day 40  \nAll patients must attend an end of follow-up visit on Day 40.  \nIf the patient is withdrawn after completion of treatment (after the Day 11 assessment), a \ntermination visit should be arranged.  This visit should be the end of follow-up visit \nassessment [Day 40].  This visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.  \nPatients or parents/guardians who do not return to the clinic will be contacted by \ntelephone to ascertain their health status, or that of their child\u2019s, record information on \nadverse events, and to ask that they return the patient diary. \n5.3.1 \nSafety \nSafety is one of the primary end-points of this study. Safety parameters include adverse \nevents, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluations.  \nPre-defined symptoms of influenza captured in the adult and pediatric diaries are not to \nbe reported as adverse events unless they can be further qualified.  Thus \u2018headache due \nto stress at work\u2019 is reported as an adverse event.  However, unexplained \u2018headache\u2019 is \nconsidered a predefined symptom related to influenza and not an adverse event.  \nAdverse events such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis are considered \nsecondary illnesses of influenza and should be recorded as adverse events. \nOther adverse events to be expected in the transplant population such as rejection and \ngraft versus host disease (in patients with HSCT) will also be collected as adverse \nevents. Nasal and throat swab samples will be assessed from each study visit for the presence of \noseltamivir-resistant mutations. \n5.3.2 \nEfficacy Assessments \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \n1. \nSymptoms of influenza-like illness.  These are captured in the patient diary for both adults \nand children (Appendix 2) and (Appendix 3).  Influenza symptoms are graded on a nominal \nscale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem).  A score of zero is \nconsidered asymptomatic.  The efficacy end point, time to alleviation of all symptoms is \ncomprised of all the symptoms captured in the patient diary.  \n2. \nTemperature.  This is captured in the patient diary.  Temperature is used for assessment of \nseveral efficacy endpoints.  \n \n5.4 \nLABORATORY ASSESSMENTS \nThe laboratory assessments include those for safety, resistance, and efficacy. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n46 \n \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum chemistry and \nhematology, will be carried out at a central laboratory.  Serum chemistry assessments comprise \nAST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea and creatinine.  Hematology assessments include CBC and \ndifferential count.  The total volume of blood loss for laboratory assessments will be \napproximately 20 mL for the entire duration of the study.  \nProtection of patient confidentiality (Section 16) will extend to any data generated from the assay \nof these samples.  Biological samples collected from all patients may be infectious and will be \nclassified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nWhen clinically indicated, the investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be assessed at \nthe local laboratory during the study to calculate creatinine clearance. \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza. \nThese are: \nNasal and throat swabs.  Two nasal and one throat swab will be collected as described \nin the Schedule of Assessments.  All swabs are sent to a central laboratory for RT-PCR \nand viral cultures.  Influenza virus shedding will be assessed.   \nAt the end of treatment (Day 11), a rapid diagnostic test is permitted for the diagnosis of \nongoing influenza.  \n5.5 \nPHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS /PHARMACODYNAMIC \nASSESSMENTS  \nParticipation in PK assessments is not compulsory for this study.  Blood samples for the \ncharacterization of oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics using a sparse sampling \nstrategy will be collected from all patients who provide additional consent to participate in \nthe PK assessments. \nBlood samples will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1) and \nas described below.  If these blood samples are collected at a home visit, site staff \nshould ensure the PK blood sample handling processing is not compromised.  The time \nand date of the dose and blood samples should be captured.  Further details on \npharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics can be found in Sections 8.3.1and 8.3.2.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n47 \n \n5.5.1 \nPharmacokinetic Assessments \nPlasma PK samples for assessment of oseltamivir carboxylate will be collected at the \nfollowing timepoints on Day 6, or any day after the 11th dose, using the following \nsampling approach: \n\u2022 \nWithin 30 minutes prior to the dose administration (e.g., 8:30 a.m. dose 9:00 a.m.) \n\u2022 \n1.5 hours \u00b1 30 minutes post-dose (e.g., 10:30 a.m. \u00b1 30 min) \n\u2022 \n4 hours \u00b1 60 minutes post dose (e.g., 1:00 p.m. \u00b1 60 min) \n\u2022 \n8 hours \u00b1 1.5 hours post dose (e.g., 5:00 p.m. \u00b1 1.5 hr) \n \nFor adults and adolescents, approximately 2 mL of blood will be collected at each \ntimepoint; therefore, the total volume blood loss for PK assessments will be \napproximately 8 mL.  For pediatric patients, not less than approximately 0.6 mL of blood \nwill be tcollected at each timepoint; therefore, the total volume blood loss for PK \nassessments will be approximately 2.4 mL. \nThe samples from this study are classified as Biological Substance, Category B.  \nPlasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate will be measured by a specific and \nvalidated method.  Details on sampling procedures, sample storage, and shipment are \nprovided in the Sampling Manual. \n5.5.2 \nPharmacodynamic Assessments \nNasal and throat swabs will be collected from individuals on the days specified in the \nschedule of assessments.  Specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  As \nimmunocompromised patients are expected to shed virus for a longer duration, viral samples will \nbe collected at all visits.  The proportion of patients with viral shedding at each visit will be \nsummarized. \n6. \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \nThe Investigational Medical Product in this study is oseltamivir dry powder (to be \nreconstituted to a concentration of 12 mg/mL) or 75 mg capsules and matching placebo. \nThe Investigational Medicinal Products will be supplied, packaged individually for each \nsubject and labeled in accordance with Roche Standard and local regulation by Roche \nClinical Trial Supply, Basel, Switzerland.  \n6.1 \nDOSE AND SCHEDULE OF STUDY DRUG \nOseltamivir will be given twice daily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.

If  stored \nunder refrigerated conditions at 2\u22128 \u00b0C (36\u221246 \u00b0F) the suspension should not be \nused for longer than 17 days.  The suspension is not suitable for freezing. \n\u00ae\nFor further details, refer to the Tamiflu  Investigator\u2019s Brochure. \nMatching placebo will be available as capsules and suspension.  Patients in the \nconventional dose arm will get the conventional dose and matching placebo so that they \nare blinded from the double dose arm.  \nEach patient will be dispensed a medication pack that will provide enough medication to \ncover 20 doses.  For patients randomized to the conventional dose arm, the medication \npack will contain a bottle of oseltamivir dry powder or a blister wallet with oseltamivir \ncapsules and matching placebo.  For patients randomized to the double dose arm, the \nmedication pack will contain two bottles of oseltamivir dry powder or two blister wallets \nwith oseltamivir capsules.  Irrespective of the treatment group the patient is randomized \nto, for each dose the patient will take the same amount from both bottles or blister \nwallets provided in the medication pack such that the sum of the amounts from each \nimmediate container constitutes one dose. \nOne dose is to be administered twice per day at approximately 12-hour intervals with a \nlight snack or glass of milk or fruit juice.  The first dose of study drug will be administered \nin the clinic at the time of randomization. \n6.3 \nBLINDING AND UNBLINDING \nRandomization will be administered by a central randomization center.  \nThe Randomization List will not be available at the study center, to the study monitors, \nproject statisticians or to the project team at Roche.

All supplies, including \npartially used or empty containers and the dispensing logs, must be returned to the \nmonitor at the end of the study. \n6.5 \nDESTRUCTION OF STUDY DRUG \nLocal or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used \ninvestigational product for safety reasons.  In these cases, it may be acceptable for \ninvestigational site staff to destroy dispensed investigational product before a monitoring \ninspection provided that source document verification is performed on the remaining \ninventory and reconciled against the documentation of quantity shipped, dispensed, \nreturned and destroyed.  Written authorization must be obtained from the sponsor or \ndesignee at study start up before destruction. \nWritten documentation of destruction must contain the following: \n\u2013 \nIdentity [batch numbers or patient numbers] of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 \nQuantity of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 \nDate of destruction \n\u2013 \nMethod of destruction \n\u2013 \nName and signature of responsible person [or company] who destroyed \ninvestigational products[s] \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n51 \n \n7. \nSAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE \n7.1 \nADVERSE EVENTS AND LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES \n7.1.1 \nClinical AEs \nPer the International Conference of Harmonization [ICH], an Adverse Event (AE) is any \nuntoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a \npharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with \nthis treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign [including \nan abnormal laboratory finding], symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use \nof a medicinal [investigational] product, whether or not considered related to the \nmedicinal [investigational] product.  Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study \nare to be reported as AEs.  Influenza signs and symptoms reported on the patient diary \nwill be summarized as efficacy end points and need not be captured as adverse events.  \nHowever, secondary illnesses due to influenza must be reported as adverse events.  \n7.1.1.1 \nIntensity  \nAll clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of \nthe CRF.   \nIntensity of AEs will be graded on a four -point scale [mild, moderate, severe, \nlife-threatening] and reported in detail on the CRF.   \nMild \ndiscomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. \nModerate \ndiscomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity. \nSevere \ninability to work or perform normal daily activity \nLife Threatening \nrepresents an immediate threat to life   \n \n7.1.1.2 \nDrug - Adverse Event Relationship \nRelationship of the AE to the treatment should always be assessed by the investigator.  \nDescription of scales can be found in Appendix 4. \n7.1.1.3 \nSerious Adverse Events [Immediately Reportable to Roche] \nCertain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate \nmeasures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report \nsuch events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take \nplace more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list \nof events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning \nof the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: \n\u2022 \nSerious adverse events \n\u2022 \nPregnancies \n \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n52 \n \nA Serious Adverse Event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect or precaution.  It is any AE that at any dose fulfils at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 \nis fatal; [results in death; NOTE:  death is an outcome, not an event].  \n\u2013 \nis Life-Threatening [NOTE:  the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer \nto an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more \nsevere]. \n\u2013 \nrequired in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 \nresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 \nis a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 \nis medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \n \nThe full requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to \n(Appendix 5). \n7.1.2 \nTreatment and Follow-up of AEs  \nAEs, especially those for which the relationship to test \u201cdrug\u201d is not \u201cunrelated\u201d, should \nbe followed up until they have returned to baseline status or stabilized.  If a clear \nexplanation is established it should be recorded on the CRF.   \n7.1.3 \nLaboratory Test Abnormalities \nLaboratory test results will appear printed on laboratory reports provided to the site from \nthe central laboratory.  \nAny laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event [SAE] \nshould be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the CRF. \nAny treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result which is clinically significant, \ni.e., meeting one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded as a single \ndiagnosis on the AE page in the CRF: \n\u2022 \nAccompanied by clinical symptoms. \n\u2022 \nLeading to a change in study drug [e.g. dose modification, interruption or \npermanent discontinuation]. \n\u2022 \nRequiring a change in concomitant therapy [e.g. addition of, interruption of, \ndiscontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or \ntreatment]. \n \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n53 \n \n7.1.4 \nFollow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values \nIn the event of medically significant unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the \ntests should be repeated and followed up until they have returned to the normal range \nand/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  If a clear explanation is \nestablished it should be recorded on the CRF.  \n7.2 \nHANDLING OF SAFETY PARAMETERS \n7.2.1 \nReporting of Serious Adverse Events [immediately reportable] \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious [as defined in \nSection 7.1.1.3 above] and which occurs during the course of the study, regardless of \nthe treatment arm, occurring from the enrollment visit (start of study screening \nprocedures), must be reported to Roche or designee immediately (i.e., no more than \n24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event [expedited reporting]). \nRelated Serious Adverse Events MUST be collected and reported regardless of the time \nelapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  \nUnrelated Serious Adverse Events must be collected and reported during the study and \nup until the follow-up visit.  \nThe definition and reporting requirements of ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data \nManagement, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be \nadhered to (Appendix 5).  The serious adverse events should be reported in the most \nup -to-date version of the SAE form. \n7.2.2 \nPregnancy  \nA female patient must be instructed to stop taking the test \u201cdrug\u201d and immediately inform \nthe investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.  The investigator should \nreport all pregnancies immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator \nbecomes aware of the pregnancy) to the Sponsor or designee, using the most \nup-to-date version of the pregnancy form.  The investigator should counsel the patient, \nand discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the \nfetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  \nPregnancies occurring within 28 days of treatment completion should be reported to \nRoche.  \n7.3 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \nEvents such as convulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of \nconsciousness, confusion, abnormal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, \nanxiety, nightmares) have been reported during oseltamivir use in patients with influenza, \npredominately in children and adolescents.  In rare cases, these events resulted in \naccidental injury.  The contribution of oseltamivir to those events is unknown.  Such \nevents have also been reported in patients with influenza who were not taking \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n54 \n \noseltamivir.  Patients, especially children and adolescents, should be closely monitored \nfor signs of abnormal behavior. \nPlease refer to the attached Investigator\u2019s Brochure for additional warnings, precautions, \nand other reported adverse events. \n8. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN   \nFull details of all planned analyses will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis \nPlan (SAP) for the safety and efficacy variables and in the Resistance Plan for the \ndevelopment of resistance.  The methods described below are an outline of the main \nplanned analyses. For continuous endpoints summary statistics including mean, standard \ndeviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be derived for each treatment group.  For \ncategorical data, the number and percentage of events and/or patients for each treatment group \nwill be presented. \n8.1 \nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY STUDY ENDPOINTS \n8.1.1 \nPrimary Endpoints \nThe primary endpoints for safety will be descriptive assessments of:  \n\u2022 \nAdverse events \n\u2022 \nPhysical examinations  \n\u2022 \nVital signs \n\u2022 \nClinical laboratory evaluations  \n\u2022 \nTissue rejection and/or graft versus host disease in transplant patients \n \nThe primary endpoint of development of resistance will be determined from the \ngenotypic and phenotypic variables measured post baseline and is described further in \nthe Resistance Plan. \n8.1.2 \nSecondary Endpoints \nThe following endpoints will be analyzed descriptively at relevant timepoints:  \n\u2022 \nShedding virus by culture and RT-PCR  \n/mL) and quantitative RT-PCR \nTCID\n\u2022 \nViral load by culture (log10\n50\n\u2022 \nIndividual symptom scores  \n\u2022 \nThe time (hours) from first dose of study drug until resolution of fever  \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis) \nat any time during the study \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis) \nat any time during the study that are treated with antibiotics \n\u2022 \nInitiation of treatment with antibiotics after randomization  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n55 \n \n\u2022 \nHospitalization, and for those who are hospitalized, the duration of hospitalization \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of rejection or GVHD \n \nThe following are the model-predicted PK secondary endpoints for oseltamivir \ncarboxylate: \n\u2022 \nSteady-state area under the concentration\u2013time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC\n) \n0-12\n\u2022 \nMaximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for oseltamivir carboxylate \n\u2022 \nTrough plasma concentration (Ctrough) for oseltamivir carboxylate \n \nThe following model-predicted PK endpoints may be included, if appropriate:  \n\u2022 \nElimination half-life (t1/2) \n\u2022 \nTime to maximum concentration (tmax) \n\u2022 \nElimination constant (ke) \n\u2022 \nApparent clearance (CL/F) \n\u2022 \nApparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) \n\u2022 \nApparent total clearance of metabolite (CLm) \n\u2022 \nLast measurable concentration (C\n) and time to last measurable concentration (t\nlast\nlast)  \n \n8.2 \nSTATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS  \n8.2.1 \nStatistical Model  \n8.2.1.1 \nTime to Event Variables \nA non-parametric model will be assumed with estimation of medians based on Kaplan-\nMeier methods.  Patients without alleviation of symptoms will have their time censored at \nthe last available observation that a complete assessment was made. \n8.2.1.2 \nDichotomous Variables and Viral Load  \nFor the endpoints defined dichotomously in terms of events or symptoms including the \ndevelopment of resistance, it will be assumed that the number of patients experiencing \nthe event or exhibiting the symptom will have a binomial distribution. \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load at Day 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40 no model will \nbe assumed.  \n8.2.2 \nSample Size \nThe sample size has been chosen to provide an adequate number of patients to \nestimate the development of resistance with reasonable precision.  Assuming that 90% \nof enrolled patients will have laboratory-confirmed influenza, there will be 75 patients in \neach treatment arm in the population evaluable for the development of resistance.  The \nfollowing table shows the 95% Pearson-Clopper confidence intervals that would result \nwith a sample size of 75 patients in a treatment arm if certain event rates are observed \nin the study. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n56 \n \nDuring the study the number of influenza A virus infected patients and the rate of \ndevelopment resistance will be monitored in a blinded fashion, in order to ensure a \nreasonable precision for the estimation.  An additional number of patients may be \nenrolled if necessary. \nObserved Rate (%) \n95% Confidence Interval \n0.0 \n  0%  - 4.8% \n1.3 \n0.0% - 7.2% \n2.7  \n0.3% - 9.3% \n5.3 \n1.5% - 13.1% \n10.7 \n4.7%-19.9% \n \nA total of 83 patients will be enrolled per arm and will be evaluable for the assessment of \nsafety.  This number of patients would provide estimates of adverse event rates with \nsimilar precision. \n8.2.3 \nHypothesis Testing  \nFormal hypothesis testing will be not performed; any comparisons between groups will be \nbased on comparison of confidence intervals.  \n8.2.4 \nAnalysis Populations \nThree main patient populations will be used for the analysis of data from this study; the \nSafety Population, the Intent-to treat Population and the Intent-to-Treat Infected \nPopulation.  Detailed definitions of these populations will be given in the SAP.  \n8.2.4.1 \nIntent to Treat Population \nAll patients randomized will be included in the intent to treat population [Patients will be \nassigned to treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes]. \n8.2.4.2 \nIntent to Treat Infected Population \nAll patients randomized and with laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, excluding \npatients infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline, will be included in the \nintent to treat influenza infected population [Patients will be assigned to treatment groups \nas randomized for analysis purposes]. \nThe ITTI Population will be the primary population for the summary and analysis of the \ndevelopment of resistance and the efficacy variables. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n57 \n \n8.2.4.3 \n Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Patient Population \nThe Pharmacokinetic evaluable patient population (PKEP) population comprises all \npatients in the ITT population who have at least one post-dose drug concentration \nmeasurement at a scheduled visit timepoint.  Patients may be excluded from the PKEP \npopulation if they significantly violate the inclusion or exclusion criteria, deviate \nsignificantly from the protocol, or have unavailable or incomplete data that may influence \nthe PK analysis.  \nDecisions on patient exclusion from the PK analysis will be made prior to database \nclosure by the clinical pharmacologist.  Excluded patients will be documented along with \nthe reason for exclusion. \n8.2.4.4 \nSubpopulations \nA subpopulation of the ITTI population will be defined comprising patients who received \ntheir first dose of study drug within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset for the \ncomparison of efficacy endpoints with the age appropriate placebo treated patients \n(pediatric or adult) from the registration trials. \n8.2.5 \nSafety Data Analysis \nThe safety analysis population will include all patients who receive at least one dose of \nstudy drug and had a safety assessment performed post randomization.  All safety \nvariables will be summarized and presented in tables based on this safety population: \n\u2022 \nAdverse events \n\u2022 \nPhysical examination \n\u2022 \nVital signs \n\u2022 \nClinical laboratory evaluations \n\u2022 \nRejection and/or graft versus host disease \n \n8.2.6 \nAnalysis of Resistance \nFor the summary of the development of resistance for each treatment arm, 95% \nconfidence intervals will be provided with the estimated rates.  Further details are \navailable in the Resistance Plan for NV20234.  These data will be summarized in a \nreport separate from the final study report. \n8.2.7 \nEfficacy Analysis \nFor the analysis of time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms, the following two assessments will \nbe made independently of each other and without regard to the outcomes in each case. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n58 \n \n\u2022 \nComparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials  \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir treatment \napproval, a population of placebo-treated patients will be established that is \ncomparable to the subpopulation of patients in the current study whose first dose of \nstudy drug was within 48 hours of symptom onset.  For this population, a median \ntime to resolution of all clinical influenza symptoms will be determined along with its \n95% confidence interval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for each \ntreatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.   \n\u2022 \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in the \nmedian times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated 95% confidence interval. \n  \nFor the dichotomous endpoints, the proportion of patients experiencing the event or symptom, \nand its associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment group.  Where \npossible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control population will be \npresented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment groups in this trial. \nThe continuous secondary endpoint time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for the time to \nalleviation of all symptoms.  \n8.2.7.1 \nExclusion of Data from Analysis \nEfficacy data collected from any patient who begins treatment with another antiviral for \ninfluenza (for example, amantadine, rimantadine, laninamivir, peramivir, or zanamavir), \nafter the other antiviral treatment commences, will be excluded from the primary and \nsecondary efficacy analyses.  Such patients will be considered failures to oseltamivir \ntreatment in the analyses.  Further details will be provided in the SAP. \n8.2.7.2 \nInterim Analysis \nNo interim analyses are planned.  \n8.2.8 \nOther Analyses \nFurther exploratory analyses will be detailed in the SAP. \n8.3 \nPHARMACOKINETIC AND PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSIS \n8.3.1 \nPharmacokinetic Analysis \nThe primary study variables are the model-derived PK parameters:  steady-state AUC, \nCmax, and C\n of oseltamivir carboxylate. \ntrough\nIndividual and mean plasma concentrations at each sampling timepoint for oseltamivir \ncarboxylate will be presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics, including \nmeans, geometric means, medians, ranges, standard deviations, and coefficients of \nvariation.  Individual and mean concentration-versus-time profiles will be plotted on \nlinear and semi-logarithmic scales. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n59 \n \nPlasma concentration data from sparse sampling will be analyzed using an established \npopulation PK model to determine key exposure parameters (e.g., Cmax, Ctrough, and \nAUC).  For immunocompromised children aged 1 to 18 years, plasma oseltamivir \ncarboxylate concentration will be modeled in NONMEM using a structure similar to a \ncomprehensive population PK model, which was previously developed using plasma \ndata from non-immunocompromised children and adults (ages 1 to 80 years) [36].  The \nbasic structure consists of a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and direct \nconversion of oseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate, while a 1-compartment model is \nused to account for the renal elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate from the plasma.  \nBody weight, evaluated using a power function and centered around 70 kg, is a \nstatistically significant predictor of both CL/F and central volume of distribution (Vc/F) for \noseltamivir carboxylate.  For oseltamivir carboxylate, CrCl is also a significant predictor \nof CL/F, while Vc/F decreases linearly with age. \n8.3.2 \nPharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis  \nIf feasible, exposure-response relationships [43]will be evaluated between independent variables \nof exposure (e.g., AUC, Cmin) and  dependent variables including continuous (area under the \nviral titer curve, and peak viral titer) and time-to-event (cessation of viral shedding) virologic \nendpoints. Exploratory PK/PD analyses will be performed using appropriate methodologies. In \norder to account for potential non-linearity and non-monotonicity, each continuous independent \nvariable (e.g., AUC) will be evaluated in its original form, as a categorical variable based on \nquartiles, as two- and three-group categorical variables. \n9. \nDATA QUALITY ASSURANCE \nThe overall procedures for quality assurance of clinical study data are described in the \nRoche Standard Operational Procedures. \nAccurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross\u2013check of \nthe CRFs against the investigator\u2019s records by the study monitor [source document \nverification], and the maintenance of a drug\u2013dispensing log by the investigator.  \nThe data collected will be entered into the study database from the working copy of the \nCRF faxed from the site. \nA comprehensive validation check program will verify the data and discrepancy reports \nwill be generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator.  As patients complete the \nstudy [or prematurely withdraw] and their signed CRFs become available, a second data \nentry will be performed from the original, signed CRF.  A comparison check will be run to \nidentify and resolve any discrepancies between the first and second data entry. \nThroughout the study the Study Management Team [SMT] will review data according to \nthe SMT Data Review Plan as described in the Data Quality Plan.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n64 \n \nPART II: ETHICS AND GENERAL STUDY ADMINISTRATION \n11. \nETHICAL ASPECTS \n11.1 \nLOCAL REGULATIONS/DECLARATION OF HELSINKI \nThe investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformance with the \nprinciples of the \u201cDeclaration of Helsinki\u201d or with the laws and regulations of the country \nin which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the \nindividual.  The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in \u201cGuideline for Good \nClinical Practice\u201d ICH Tripartite Guideline [January 1997] or with local law if it affords \ngreater protection to the patient.  For studies conducted in the European \nUnion/European Economic Areacountries, the investigator will ensure compliance with \nthe EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC].  For studies conducted in the United States \nor under US IND, the investigator will additionally ensure that the basic principles of \n\u201cGood Clinical Practice\u201d as outlined in the current version of 21 CFR, subchapter D, part \n312, \u201cResponsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators\u201d, part 50, \u201cProtection of Human \nSubjects\u201d, and part 56, \u201cInstitutional Review Boards\u201d, are adhered to. \nIn other countries where \u201cGuideline for Good Clinical Practice\u201d exist Roche and the \ninvestigators will strictly ensure adherence to the stated provisions. \n11.2 \nINFORMED CONSENT  \nIt is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator [if \nacceptable by local regulations], to obtain written informed consent from each patient \nparticipating in this study, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated \nbenefits, and potential hazards of the study.  For patients not qualified or incapable of \ngiving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legally acceptable \nrepresentative.  In the case where both the patient and his/her legally acceptable \nrepresentative are unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the \nentire informed consent discussion.  After the patient and representative have orally \nconsented to participation in the trial, the witness\u2019 signature on the form will attest that \nthe information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood.  The \ninvestigator or designee must also explain that the patients are completely free to refuse \nto enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason.  The Case Report \nForms [CRFs] for this study contain a section for documenting informed patient consent, \nand this must be completed appropriately.  If new safety information results in significant \nchanges in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and \nupdated if necessary.  All patients [including those already being treated] should be \ninformed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form and give their consent \nto continue in the study. \nIf children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the study, they should \nalso be informed and should also provide their written consent. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n65 \n \n11.3 \nINDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEES/INSTITUTIONAL \nREVIEW BOARD  \nIndependent Ethics Committees [non-US]:  This protocol and any accompanying \nmaterial provided to the patient [such as patient information sheets or descriptions of the \nstudy used to obtain informed consent] as well as any advertising or compensation given \nto the patient, will be submitted by the investigator to an Independent Ethics Committee.  \nApproval from the committee must be obtained before starting the study, and should be \ndocumented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the committee \nmet and granted the approval. \nAny modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the Independent Ethics \nCommittee approval must also be submitted by the investigator to the Committee in \naccordance with local procedures and regulatory requirements. \nWhen no local review board exists, the investigator is expected to submit the protocol to \na regional committee.  If no regional committee exists, Roche will assist the investigator \nin submitting the protocol to the European Ethics Review Committee. \nInstitutional Review Board [US]:  It is the understanding of the sponsor that this \nprotocol [and any modifications] as well as appropriate consent procedures, will be \nreviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board.  This board must operate in \naccordance with the current Federal Regulations.  A letter or certificate of approval will \nbe sent by the investigator to the Sponsor or designee prior to initiation of the study, and \nalso whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made. \n12. \nCONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL \nProtocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between \nan appropriate representative of the sponsor and the investigator [investigator \nrepresentative[s] in the case of a multicenter trial].  Protocol modifications must be \nprepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially reviewed and approved by the \nClinical Science Leader/Clinical Pharmacologist and Biostatistician. \nAll protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Independent Ethics \nCommittee or Institutional Review Board for information and approval in accordance with \nlocal requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required.  Approval must be awaited \nbefore any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an \nimmediate hazard to trial patients, or when the change[s] involves only logistical or \nadministrative aspects of the trial [e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone \nnumber[s]. \n13. \nCONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY \nBoth the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  \nShould this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual study \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n66 \n \nbasis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, Roche and the investigator \nwill assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient\u2019s interests. \n14. \nSTUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS AND RECORD KEEPING \n14.1 \nINVESTIGATOR'S FILES / RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS \nThe Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of \nthe study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These \ndocuments should be classified into two different separate categories [1] Investigator's \nStudy File, and [2] patient clinical source documents. \nThe Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, Case Report and \nQuery Forms, Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and \ngovernmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, \nstaff curriculum vitae and authorization forms and other appropriate \ndocuments/correspondence etc.  \nPatient clinical source documents [usually defined by the project in advance to record \nkey efficacy/safety parameters independent of the CRFs] would include patient \nhospital/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original \nlaboratory reports, ECG, EEG, X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed \ninformed consent forms, consultant letters, and patient screening and enrollment logs.  \nThe Investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least 15 \nyears after completion or discontinuation of the study.  After that period of time the \ndocuments may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.  \nShould the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them \nto another location, Roche must be notified in advance. \nIf the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site \nfor any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the \nInvestigator and Roche to store these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that \nthey can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where \nsource documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies \nshould be made for storing outside of the site. \n14.2 \nSOURCE DOCUMENTS AND BACKGROUND DATA \nThe investigator shall supply the sponsor or designee on request with any required \nbackground data from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly \nimportant when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are suspected.  In \ncase of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, \nit is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that patient \nconfidentiality is protected. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n67 \n \n14.3 \nAUDITS AND INSPECTIONS \nThe investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made \navailable to appropriately qualified personnel from the Roche Pharma Development \nQuality Assurance Unit or its designees, or to health authority inspectors after \nappropriate notification.  The verification of the CRF data must be by direct inspection of \nsource documents. \n14.4 \nCASE REPORT FORMS \nFor each patient enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal \ninvestigator or authorized delegate from the study staff.  This also applies to records for \nthose patients who fail to complete the study [even during a pre-randomization screening \nperiod if a CRF was initiated].  If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be \nnoted on the CRF.  If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment-\nlimiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. \nAll forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink, and must be legible.  Errors \nshould be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change \ninitialed and dated by the investigator or his/her authorized delegate.  The investigator \nshould ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported \nto the sponsor or designee in the CRFs and in all required reports. \n15. \nMONITORING THE STUDY \nIt is understood that the responsible Roche monitor [or designee] will contact and visit \nthe investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the various records \nof the trial [CRFs and other pertinent data] provided that patient confidentiality is \nmaintained in accord with local requirements. \nIt will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout \nthe study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and \naccuracy of the data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to \nlaboratory test reports and other patient records needed to verify the entries on the CRF.  \nThe investigator [or his/her deputy] agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that \nany problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. \n16. \nCONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND PATIENT \nRECORDS \nThe investigator must assure that patients\u2019 anonymity will be maintained and that their \nidentities are protected from unauthorized parties.  On CRFs or other documents \nsubmitted to the sponsor or designee, patients should not be identified by their names, \nbut by an identification code.  The investigator should keep a patient enrollment log \nshowing codes, names and addresses.  The investigator should maintain documents not \nfor submission to Roche, e.g., patients\u2019 written consent forms, in strict confidence. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version E \n68 \n \n17. \nPUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE \nSECRETS \nThe results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is \nforeseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Roche prior to \nsubmission.  This allows the sponsor or designee to protect proprietary information and \nto provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be \navailable to the investigator. \nIn accord with standard editorial and ethical practice, Roche will generally support \npublication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In \nthis case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. \nAny formal publication of the study in which input of Roche personnel exceeded that of \nconventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and \nthe appropriate Roche personnel.  Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

[There are important \nexceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet \ndrug-relatedness clearly exists; e.g., [1] bone marrow depression, [2] tardive \ndyskinesias]. \n4. \nIt follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n5. \nIt reappears upon rechallenge. \n \nPOSSIBLE [must have first two] \n1. \nThis category applies to those AEs in which the connection with the test drug \nadministration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  An AE may \nbe considered possible if, or when: \n2. \nIt follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n3. \nIt may have been produced by the patient\u2019s clinical state, environmental or toxic \nfactors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. \n4. \nIt follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n \nREMOTE [must have first two] \n1. \nIn general, this category is applicable to an AE which meets the following criteria: \n2. \nIt does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n3. \nIt may readily have been produced by the patient\u2019s clinical state, environmental or \ntoxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. \n4. \nIt does not follow a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. \n5. \nIt does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered. \n \nUNRELATED \nThis category is applicable to those AEs which are judged to be clearly and \nincontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes [disease, environment, etc.] and do not \nmeet the criteria for drug relationship listed under remote, possible, or probable. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

It is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 \nis fatal; [results in death] [NOTE:  death is an outcome, not an event]. \n\u2013 \nis Life-Threatening    [NOTE:  the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer \nto an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more \nsevere]. \n\u2013 \nrequired in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 \nresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 \nis a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 \nis medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \nMedical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited \nreporting to the sponsor or designee is appropriate in other situations, such as important \nmedical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or \nhospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one \nof the outcomes listed in the definitions above.  These situations should also usually be \nconsidered serious. \nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for \nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; \nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \nAn unexpected AE is one, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the \napplicable product information. \nCausality is initially assessed by the investigator.  For Serious Adverse Events, possible \ncauses of the event is indicated by selecting one or more options.

The patients will be positive for influenza by a rapid diagnostic test, PCR or virus \nculture at baseline. \nLength of Study \nThe study comprises 10 days of treatment with follow up visits approximately 5 and 30 days \nlater as shown in the schedule of assessments.  Study medication will be administered twice \ndaily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.  A rapid diagnostic test for influenza will be performed \nat the end of the 10 days of treatment.  Patients still having influenza based on the rapid \ndiagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care by the principal investigator, and \nany medication provided during the follow-up period should be captured in the CRF.   \nProcedures (summary) \nThe key procedures are: \n\u2022 \nBlood draws for serum chemistry, hematology, serology, and PK assessments (for those \npatients who provide additional consent to participate in the PK assessments). \n\u2022 \nNasal and throat swabs for viral culture and RT-PCR. \n \nAssessments of: \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum chemistry \nand hematology will be carried out at a central laboratory.  Serum chemistry assessments \ncomprise AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea and creatinine.  Hematology assessments include CBC \nand differential count.  The total volume of blood loss for laboratory assessments will be \napproximately 20 mL for the entire duration of the study.  \nProtection of patient confidentiality (Section16) will extend to any data generated from the \nassaying of these samples.  Biological samples taken from all patients may be infectious and \nwill be classified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nWhen clinically indicated, the investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be assessed \nat the local laboratory during the study to calculate creatinine clearance \nResistance \nDevelopment of resistance \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n16 \n \nPART I: STUDY DESIGN AND CONDUCT \n1. \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n1.1 \nBACKGROUND \nInfluenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by a virus of the orthomyxovirus family \nwhich occurs in three forms, influenza A, B, and C.  Influenza virus types A and B cause \nan acute febrile infection of the respiratory tract characterized by the sudden onset of \nfever, malaise, headaches, myalgias and cough.  Influenza causes numerous deaths \neach year [1].  Although difficult to assess, annual influenza epidemics are thought to \nresult in between three and five million cases of severe illness and between 250,000 and \n500,000 deaths every year around the world [2]. \nThe influenza viruses are segmented, negative sense, single stranded, lipid \nencapsulated, RNA viruses between 80 and 100 nm in size.  Subtypes are defined \naccording to glycoproteins present in the viral lipid coat.  The hemagglutinin complex \n(HA) is the major surface protein of the virus.  The neuraminidase (NA) proteins are the \nsecond major surface proteins in the virion and play a role in enhancing virus penetration \nof the mucus layer around the target cell and in release of virus from the cell surface.  \nThe M2 protein triggers the disintegration of the virion during virus entry into the cell and \nmay also be involved in protecting the HA prior to assembly of new virus particles.  \n1.1.1 \nInfluenza in the Immunodeficient Population \nInfluenza infection is usually a self\u2212limiting condition.  However, in children, the elderly, \nand the immunocompromised, influenza infection can be associated with substantial \nmorbidity and mortality [1].  In patients with compromised immunity, influenza virus may \ncause severe lower respiratory tract involvement; unusual syndromes, including \nencephalitis, myocarditis, and hepatitis; and death [3].   \nConditions that compromise immunity may be classified based on etiology into primary \n(genetic) and secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency.  Of the immunodeficient \nconditions, the ones that affect cell mediated immunity are likely to have adverse \noutcomes following viral infections [16]. \nPrimary immunodeficiency  \nPrimary immunodeficiencies are relatively common, may be either congenital or manifest \nlater in life, and are classified according to whether the genetic defect affects T or B cells \nor both [16].  There are four groups of disorders:  severe combined immunodeficiency \n(SCID), primary T cell deficiency (e.g., CD8 deficiency, DiGeorge syndrome), \npredominantly B-cell-related antibody deficiency (e.g., common variable \nimmunodeficiency, selective IgA deficiency), and other well-defined immunodeficiency \nsyndromes (e.g., Wiskott Aldrich syndrome) [16].  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n17 \n \nOf the primary immunodeficiencies, antibody deficiencies are the most frequent.  \nHowever, some of the more common antibody deficiency conditions (isolated IgA \ndeficiency, IgG subclass deficiency, and common variable immunodeficiency) have \nintact cell-mediated immunity and therefore the clinical course of viral infections (unless \ncomplicated by bacterial infections) does not differ significantly from that in the normal \nhost [16].  A list of primary immunodeficiency disorders at risk for viral infections is \nprovided in Appendix 6.  The incidence of some of these conditions has been estimated.  \nThe incidence of SCID is 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 1,000,000 [16].  The more severe forms of \nprimary immunodeficiency are relatively rare, have their onset early in life, and all too \nfrequently result in death during childhood [16].  \nSecondary Immunodeficiency \nSecondary immunodeficiencies are not caused by intrinsic abnormalities in development \nof T and B cells [16].  Secondary immunodeficiency may result from diseases (human \nimmunodeficiency virus [HIV], hematologic malignancy) or immunosuppressive and \ncytotoxic drugs (such as those used for treatment of transplant recipients, collagen \nvascular disease, malignancies).  \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to disease \nHIV-infected individuals with a CD4+ T-cell count of < 200/mm3 (AIDS defining) are \nhighly susceptible to opportunistic disease [16].  However, CD4 counts < 500/mm3 are \nconsidered abnormal in HIV-infected individuals, and therefore these individuals are \nalso more susceptible to infection.  CD4+ T-cell counts are higher in infants and young \nchildren than in adults and decline over the first few years of life [40, 41].  Because of \nthis age-dependent variation in absolute CD4+ T-cell count, calculation of CD4 \npercentage is used as a measure for young children because it has shown less \nvariability.  HIV-infected children (12 months to 5 years old) with < 15% CD4+ T cells are \nclassed as severely immunosuppressed and highly susceptible to opportunistic disease, \nalthough antiretroviral therapy is recommended in children with < 25% CD4+ T cells as \nthey are still classified as immunosuppressed [42].  Studies in patients with HIV/AIDS \nhave shown an increased risk for heart and lung-related hospitalizations during the \ninfluenza season compared with other times of the year, prolonged duration of influenza \nsymptoms, increased risk for influenza-related complications, and a higher risk of \ninfluenza-related death [17]. \nSeveral hematologic malignancies affect the immune system (Appendix 7).  Several \nauthors have reported influenza in children and adults with hematologic malignancies \n[18, 19, 20, 21].  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n18 \n \nSecondary immunodeficiency due to drugs (e.g., transplant recipients, collagen \nvascular disease, malignancies) \nThe enhanced survival of the transplant population following the availability of newer \nimmunosuppressive drugs has made them representative of the immunocompromised \npopulation in general and secondary immunodeficiency due to drugs, in particular. \nIn transplant recipients, influenza is associated with a higher rate of pulmonary \ncomplications, extrapulmonary manifestations, and an increased risk of graft dysfunction \nand high attributable mortality.  In a cohort study of influenza viral infection in solid organ \ntransplant (SOT) patients, 30 cases of influenza viral infection were identified.  \nSecondary bacterial pneumonia was seen in 17% of patients and three SOT recipients \n(2 liver and 1 kidney) had myositis, myocarditis, and bronchiolitis obliterans.  Biopsy of \nthe transplanted organ was performed in 21 of 30 cases and revealed variable degrees \nof acute allograft rejection in 62% of patients.  The study concluded that influenza was \nassociated with significant morbidity in different groups of SOT recipients [4]. \nAmong transplant recipients, patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) \nare at the greatest risk for morbidity.  In a prospective study from the Infectious Diseases \nWorking Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, \n1973 patients were evaluated for respiratory virus infections after stem cell \ntransplantation.  The overall mortality was 23% from influenza A infection and the direct \ninfluenza A-associated mortality was 15.3% in this study [5].  A large retrospective study \n(4797 patients undergoing HSCT over a 13-year period) identified 62 patients with \ninfluenza of whom as many as 29% (18 of 62 patients) developed pneumonia.  Ten \npercent of the patients with influenza died [6].  \nThe increased morbidity in transplant patients is associated with increased duration of \nvirus shedding compared to that in healthy subjects.  In otherwise healthy adults, elderly \npatients and children, the median duration of viral shedding in untreated patients was 70, \n96, and 118 hours, respectively [7].  In contrast, in the retrospective HSCT study, \ninfluenza virus was shed in nasopharyngeal secretions (evaluated at least weekly) for a \nmedian duration of 168 hours (7 days, range 2 to 37 days) [6]. \nCurrently available treatments for influenza infection are the M2 ion channel inhibitors \n(e.g., amantadine, rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir, \nzanamivir).  \n1.1.2 \nOseltamivir \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae, Ro 64-0796) is an ethyl ester prodrug that is rapidly absorbed \nfrom the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and metabolized in the liver by \nhigh capacity carboxylesterases to form oseltamivir carboxylate (Ro 64-0802), a potent, \nstable, and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes.  The active \nform, oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted unchanged by the kidney via glomerular \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n19 \n \nfiltration and active tubular secretion by the organic anion transport system.  The efficacy \nand safety of oseltamivir in influenza treatment and prevention has been established in \nan extensive series of clinical studies in man. \nOseltamivir has been approved for the treatment of influenza in Europe, the \nUnited States and most other countries around the world.  In adults and adolescents, the \nrecommended dose is 75 mg twice daily for 5 days.  In children 1 year of age and older, \nrecommended doses are 30, 45, or 60 mg BID based on body weight.  In all age groups, \nthe recommended dose is administered BID for 5 days.   \nThe approval of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza is based on several controlled \nclinical trials.  In the pooled population from these clinical trials encompassing adults \naged from 13\u221297 years, many with significant co-morbidity, 1325 patients were treated \nwith oseltamivir (75 mg BID) and 1056 patients received placebo.  A total of seven \ninfluenza symptoms (both respiratory and constitutional) were captured on the diary card \nfor adults.  The time to resolution of all symptoms (on the diary card) decreased by \n24 hours; from 124.5 hours in the placebo arm to 100.6 hours with oseltamivir \n75 mg BID (p < 0.0001) [7].  Further, in adults and adolescents with a proven influenza \nillness, oseltamivir treatment reduced overall antibiotic use for any reason by 26.7% and \nthe incidence of influenza-related lower respiratory tract complications resulting in \nantibiotic therapy by 55%.  The study concluded that oseltamivir treatment of influenza \nreduces lower respiratory tract complications, antibiotic use, and hospitalizations in \nhealthy and \u2018at risk\u2019 patients [8].   \nLikewise, in the influenza-infected pediatric population (1\u221212 years of age), oseltamivir \ntreatment (n = 217) was compared with placebo (n = 235).  There was a reduction in the \nmedian duration of illness (defined based on resolution of temperature, cough, coryza \nand return to pre-illness health and activity) of 36 hours; from 137 hours with placebo to \n101 hours in the oseltamivir treatment arm (p \u2264 0.0001).  The Canadian Acute \nRespiratory Infections Scale (CARIFS), validated for use in children, was used to collect \nsymptom data on the pediatric diary card.  The CARIFS scale comprised a total of \n18 symptoms that were evaluated twice daily by the parent or guardian.  There was a \nsimilar reduction in the time to alleviation of all CARIFS symptoms of 36 hours; from \n100 hours in the placebo group to 63 hours in the oseltamivir group (p < 0.0001) [9].  \nThus in both adults and children, the time to resolution of all symptoms was significantly \nreduced in the oseltamivir treatment arm compared with placebo.   \nOseltamivir was well-tolerated in clinical trials.  Approximately 11,000 patients have \nreceived oseltamivir in the development program.  The most common adverse events \nreported by adults, the elderly, and children were nausea and vomiting.  Serious adverse \nevents (SAEs) were reported with a low and equal frequency by patients taking active \ndrug and placebo.  Full details are given in the Investigator Brochure [7]. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n20 \n \nThe safety profile of oseltamivir has been well characterized for the prophylaxis \nindication in a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial conducted in the adult \nand pediatric immunocompromised (HSCT and SOT) population.  In the oseltamivir \ngroup, the indications for transplant included hematologic malignancies (acute and \nchronic leukemias, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome), lymphoid \nmalignancies (Hodgkin\u2019s or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas), primary immunodeficiencies \n(Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, and severe combined \nimmunodeficiency).  Other rare indications included bone marrow aplasia, paroxysmal \nnocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelofibrosis, and multiple sclerosis.  In the safety population, \nthere were 239 patients randomized to the conventional dose of oseltamivir and 238 to \nplacebo.  The total number of adverse events reported in the placebo group (361 events) \nwas generally similar to that in the oseltamivir group (323 events).  Diarrhea was the \nmost frequently reported adverse event (placebo, 8%; oseltamivir, 6%).  There were no \ndeaths in the oseltamivir group.  Oseltamivir was found to be safe in immunosuppressed \ntransplant recipients [22]. \nLimited safety and/or efficacy of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is available from \nseveral case reports in children and adolescents.  Oseltamivir was shown to be safe \nand/or effective in HIV infected children (n = 10) [23], children (ages 3 to 12 years) with \nacute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (n = 10) [21], in a nosocomial H1N1 outbreak in a \npediatric (children aged 10 months to 13 years) oncology ward (n = 8) [20], in children \nand adolescents (ages 2 to 19 years) with malignancies (ALL, neuroblastoma, brain \ntumor, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myelodysplasia, acute \nmyeloid leukemia (AML), Wilms tumor, aplastic anemia, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), \nand acute promyelocytic leukemia) (n = 51) [18], in children aged 4 to 14 years on \nimmunosuppressive drugs (n = 5) [24], and in children (aged 5 months to 5 years) with \nbone marrow transplant (n = 3) [25].  \nOseltamivir has also been shown to be safe and/or effective in mixed populations of \nchildren and adults (62 patients) with HSCT [6] and in a large epidemiologic study \n(n = 221) with SOT [26].  \nFinally, oseltamivir has been shown to be safe and/or effective in immunocompromised \nadults with HSCT [10] and adults with lung transplant [27, 28, 29].  \nThe dose of oseltamivir was the same as the conventional dose in a majority of these \nreports.  In one report, as many as 25 adult patients received twice the conventional \ndose [26] while in another report three of nine adult patients received twice the \nconventional dose [29].  Treatment with oseltamivir generally ranged from 5 to 10 days \n[28, 29, 26] and occasionally until the patient was symptom free [28, 29].  In exceptional \ncases treatment was given for as long as 20 days [18] or for as long as the patient was \npositive by RT-PCR [21]. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n21 \n \nThere is some concern about the development of resistance in the immunocompromised \npopulation.  During the pandemic influenza season, more than 23,000 clinical isolates of \nnovel H1N1 pandemic virus were tested for resistance in the 6 international WHO \nregions.  A total of 225 isolates (from 225 patients) were resistant (H275Y mutation in \nthe neuraminidase coding sequence) to oseltamivir for an approximate incidence of 1%.  \nInformation on immune status was available for 142 of 225 patients.  Among the \n142 patients, 56 (40%) were immunocompromised [30].  Prolonged viral replication and \nlack of immune-mediated virus clearance in immunosuppressed patients treated with \nantivirals can result in a higher incidence of selection of drug-resistant viruses, a \nphenomenon that has been documented previously [31, 32].  \n1.2 \nRATIONALE FOR THE STUDY  \nBecause of the increasing body of evidence (Section 1.1.2), oseltamivir is recommended \nin national guidelines as an option for the treatment of influenza in the transplant \npopulation [37], which comprises a significant portion of the immunocompromised \npopulation.  However, there is limited data on safety and efficacy of oseltamivir use in \nthis population.  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and resistance, \nwhile evaluating efficacy as a secondary objective, in the broader immunocompromised \npatient population, who are considered at increased risk of viral infection. \n2. \nOBJECTIVES  \n2.1 \nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE \nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate prospectively the safety and tolerability \nof oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients and \ncharacterize the effects of oseltamivir in immunocompromised patients on the \ndevelopment of resistant influenza virus. \n2.2 \nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES \nThe secondary objectives of the study are:  \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and double dose oseltamivir in \nimmunocompromised patients on: \n\u2022 \nThe population pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in \nimmunocompromised patients with confirmed influenza infection, through the \napplication of established population pharmacokinetic (PK) models to the sparse \nplasma concentration data generated  \n\u2022 \nThe virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntimepoints) \n\u2022 \nThe time to resolution of influenza symptoms \n\u2022 \nThe clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced \nby otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis)  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n22 \n \n\u2022 \nTo explore the relationship of metrics of exposure (e.g., AUC, Cmin) to relevant \npharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints \n \n3. \nSTUDY DESIGN \n3.1 \nOVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND DOSING REGIMEN \nThis is a double blind, randomized, stratified, multi-center trial of conventional and \ndouble dose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients.  \nImmunocompromised patients, who develop an influenza-like illness with a positive rapid \ndiagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture for influenza, will be enrolled during the influenza \nseason.  Patients will be stratified by transplant status [yes, no], the time between onset \nof influenza symptoms and treatment start (up to 96 hours) [\u2264 48 hours; > 48 hours], \ninfluenza vaccination status for current influenza season [yes; no] and by age \n[\u2264 12 years; > 12 years].  Eligible patients will be consented and randomized to receive \noseltamivir twice daily for 10 days in one of two treatment arms:  conventional dose or \ndouble dose (double the conventional dose).  \n3.1.1 \nRationale for Study Design \nThis study incorporates several features that distinguish it from classic placebo \ncontrolled trials.  \nThere is no placebo control arm in this study as it was considered unethical for this high \nrisk population.  The development of resistance following treatment with oseltamivir (one \nof the primary objectives of the study) is an objective assessment (determined by \nlaboratory tests) and is unlikely to be impacted by the absence of a placebo arm.  \nAs a placebo control arm was considered unethical in this population, an alternative \ncontrol arm had to be identified for efficacy endpoints.  The response to placebo in \npivotal oseltamivir registration trials in the healthy adult population with influenza was \nchosen as a control in lieu of a placebo arm in the current trial.  In order to do this, the \nendpoints were designed to be similar to that in the pivotal registration trials.  \nThe following sections provide rationale and justification for specific aspects of the study \ndesign that differ from the currently approved dosing for influenza or from previous \npivotal registration trials.  They also provide information on how the results will be used \nto make recommendations on dose and duration of treatment. \n3.1.1.1 \nChoice of Treatment Arms \nThe currently approved dose of oseltamivir for the treatment indication is the \nconventional dose with a duration of 5 days.  In this study a conventional and double \ndose are being evaluated.  The pivotal registration trials for oseltamivir in healthy adults \nwith influenza had three treatment arms; two active (75 mg and 150 mg) and one \nplacebo.  Both treatment arms were found to be significantly better than placebo.  No \nstatistical comparisons were made between the two active treatment arms.  Evaluation \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n23 \n \nof the results in the two active treatment arms did not reveal any clinically meaningful \ndifference.  However, the proportion of patients shedding virus on Day 4 (3 days after \nthe start of treatment), suggested a possible dose-response relationship (36%, 28%, and \n23% in the placebo, 75 mg, and 150 mg dose arms, respectively).  Because defective \nimmune-mediated virus clearance in immunosuppressed patients treated with antivirals \ncan result in a higher incidence of selection of drug-resistant viruses, it was decided to \nuse both the conventional and double dose arm for this study.  A longer duration of \ntreatment was chosen because a large retrospective study has shown that the median \nduration of viral shedding of 7 days [6] was greater for HSCT recipients than that seen in \nthe healthy children, adult, and elderly population with influenza (Section 1.1.1) [7].  \n3.1.1.2 \nInclusion of Patients Symptomatic up to 96 Hours \nIn immunocompromised patients, time from onset of symptoms to seeking medical \nattention (presentation at the clinic) of > 48 hours has been shown in several case \nreports [33, 27, 28, 29] including two instances of nosocomial outbreaks in children \n[25, 20].  This notwithstanding, oseltamivir has been shown to offer benefit in \nimmunocompromised populations that included patients treated with oseltamivir beyond \n48 hours of presentation; patients with lung transplant (median time to presentation \n3 days) [27], bone marrow transplant (treatment started more than 48 hours after onset \nof symptoms in all 3 patients) [25], organ transplant (62 of 221 patients started treatment \nafter 96 hours) [26], and children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (one child presented \nafter 3 days and two children presented after 5 days of symptoms) [21]. \nIn a prospective, observational study involving adults hospitalized with influenza, the \nstudy authors concluded that \u2018Weakened host defenses slow viral clearance, whereas \nantivirals started within the first four days of illness enhance viral clearance\u2019 [34].  \nAdditionally, in November 2009, in a communication for clinicians on antiviral treatments \nfor H1N1, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that while \nantiviral treatment is most effective when started early; both outpatients with risk factors \nand hospitalized patients still benefit when treatment with oseltamivir is started more \nthan 48 hours after illness onset [35].   \n3.1.1.3 \nRational for Sparse PK Sampling \nLimited PK sampling will be done in this protocol, in patients who have provided \nadditional consent, and is justifiable in this study for the following two reasons: \n\u2022 \nThere are already tested and qualified population PK models available [36] that \nwill be used to estimate exposure in the immunocompromised population on the \nbasis of the data collected in this study, meaning extensive PK sampling over a \nsteady-state dosing interval is not required.  \n\u2022 \nThe patient population in this study is likely to be very ill with a complex clinical \npicture and significant additional burden of treatment and monitoring due to their \nprimary condition.  In this context, it makes ethical sense to minimize blood draws \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n24 \n \nand assessments to only those absolutely essential to meet the objectives of the \nstudy and to ensure patient safety. \n \n3.1.1.4 \nInterpretation of Study Results  \nSafety and tolerability and the development of resistance are the primary objectives of \nthis study.  These will be characterized descriptively.  For the secondary objective of \nefficacy, the subset of the population enrolled in the first 48 hours will be compared with \nplacebo patients from pivotal registration trials (where patients were enrolled in the first \n2 days of illness).  Section 8.2.5 , Section 8.2.6 , and Section 8.2.7 provide details on the \nstatistical considerations. \nStratification \nStratification in this study has no bearing on any comparisons with results from previous \ntrials.  However, in order to evaluate a dose response relationship between the two \nactive treatment arms in this trial, stratification remains essential.  \nPatients will be stratified by transplant status (yes, no) because transplant patients form \na relatively large homogenous group in this study and might influence outcome.  \nPatients will be stratified by time between onset of symptoms and treatment start \n(< 48 hours or \u2265 48 hours) because previous experience in otherwise healthy adults and \nchildren has shown that patients treated early in their illness respond to treatment better \nthan those who are treated later.  Patients will also be stratified by age (\u2264 12 years \nand > 12 years) because otherwise healthy children shed virus longer than otherwise \nhealthy adults.  It is expected that a similar difference in the duration of viral shedding \nwould exist between immunocompromised children and adults.  As vaccinated patients \nmay respond faster to therapy, the study is also stratified based on influenza vaccination \nstatus for the current influenza season (yes; no).  \n3.1.2 \nRationale for Dose Selection and Adjustment \nDose Selection \nThe dose of oseltamivir to be used in this study is the conventional, approved dose for \nchildren and adults in the treatment of influenza.  There will be a second higher dose for \ncomparison, which is two times the conventional dose.  This higher dose is used based \non theoretical considerations, which suggest that the higher dose may be associated \nwith improved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance.  \nThe anticipated pro-drug and metabolite exposures from this higher dose are not \nexpected to exceed maximum exposures seen previously in the oseltamivir development \nprogram.  The safety and tolerability of the higher dose regimen has already been \ndemonstrated in treatment studies of immunocompetent adult subjects (n = 447) [11].  \nIn a study to demonstrate cardiac safety, in the highest dose group treated with \n450 mg BID for 5 days [n = 99], no subject had a serious adverse event, nor withdrew \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n25 \n \nprematurely.  In Phase I studies in adults, oseltamivir has been administered in multiple \ndoses of up to 500 mg BID.  Doses of 200 mg BID and greater have been associated \nwith increased gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) [7].  In adult \nsubjects with creatinine clearances of \u2264 30 mL/min, doses of 100 mg BID for 6 days \nwere well tolerated, despite steady-state oseltamivir carboxylate exposures \napproximately 10-fold higher than those achieved with standard dosing in renally \ncompetent individuals [12].  No other adverse effects were reported more frequently \nwith higher doses and no serious adverse events have been reported within the \nvolunteer studies.  Co-administration of oseltamivir with food has been demonstrated \nto substantially reduce the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal side effects.  \nThus, the rationale for the double dose arm in this study is to explore the possibility of \nimproved efficacy and decreased emergence of resistance without an undue increase \nin risk.  For patients with a creatinine clearance level of 45 mL/min or above, oseltamivir \ncarboxylate exposures for both the 75-mg and 150-mg doses are not expected to \nexceed exposures previously tested.  Patients with a creatinine clearance as low as \n45 mL/min, who receive the 150-mg BID dose, will have exposures of oseltamivir \ncarboxylate that are within (albeit in the upper end) the established safety margin. This \ncorresponds to an AUC produced by the 450-mg BID dose in adults with normal renal \nfunction (AUC 0-12 hrs of approximately 15,000 ng \u2022 hr/mL).  \nDrug interactions with immunosuppressive medications have also been evaluated.  \nThe pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate after administration of \n75 mg oseltamivir (conventional adult dose) in patients with a well-functioning, stable \nrenal allograft who were being maintained on immunosuppressive therapy were studied.  \nThese were similar to those described in the literature for adults with comparable \ndegrees of renal function.  Oseltamivir was well tolerated and had no clinically relevant \neffect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or \nmycophenolate mofetil [7]. \nDuration of Dosing \nThe duration of dosing chosen for this population (10 days) is longer than that in the \nhealthy adult and pediatric populations (5 days).  This is based on observations that the \nviral shedding and illness are typically longer in immunocompromised patients than it is \nin healthy adults [6, 10]. \nDose Adjustments \nAs this is a double blind study, patients whose creatinine clearance (CrCl) decreases to \n< 45mL/min (adults) using the Cockcroft-Gault method or <45 mL/min/1.73m2 (<18 years \nold) using the Schwartz equation will be discontinued from study treatment.  A lower limit \nof 45 mL/min for CrCl will be used to allow for patients with a mild to moderate renal \nimpairment.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n26 \n \n3.1.3 \nEnd of Study \nThe study comprises 10 days of treatment with follow-up visits approximately 5 and \n30 days later as shown in the schedule of assessments.  Study medication will be \nadministered BID over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.  A rapid diagnostic test for \ninfluenza will be performed at the end of the 10 days of treatment.  Patients still having \ninfluenza based on the rapid diagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care \nby the principal investigator, and any medication provided during the follow-up period \nshould be captured in the CRF.  \n3.2 \nNUMBER OF PATIENTS/ASSIGNMENT TO TREATMENT \nGROUPS \nA minimum of 166 patients (approximately 83 per arm) to allow an adequate number of \ninfluenza A patients, including 50 transplant recipients and at least 15 pediatric patients, \nwill be enrolled in this study.  After screening, patients will be randomly assigned to one \nof the two active treatment groups. \n3.3 \nCENTERS \nThis will be a multicenter study taking place in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres \nat approximately 125 centers.  \n4. \nSTUDY POPULATION \n4.1 \nOVERVIEW \nThe study population comprises immunocompromised adults (including adolescents) \nand children (pediatric) who have influenza (the pediatric and adolescent patients will \nbe defined as 1 year to less than 18 years of age at randomization).  Additionally, the \npatients must not have other medical conditions that will preclude the assessment of \nefficacy or safety.  Influenza vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients are eligible to \nparticipate in this study.  Principal investigators will review oseltamivir resistance \npatterns of strains circulating in the area and weigh the risk versus the benefit before \nenrolling patients with a potentially resistant strain. \nUnder no circumstances are patients who enroll in this study permitted to be \nre-randomized to this study and enrolled for a second course of treatment. \n4.2 \nINCLUSION CRITERIA \n\u2022 \nAge greater than or equal to 1 year \n\u2022 \nRapid diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture positive for influenza \n\u2022 \nImmunocompromised patient defined as one who meets any of the following: \no Primary immunodeficiency at risk for viral infections (representative \nexamples in Appendix 6) OR \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Live attenuated vaccines may not be advisable for this population.  It is \npossible that concurrent use with oseltamivir may render live vaccines ineffective.  \nMedications required for the routine care of the patient may be continued during the \nstudy.  Concomitant use of probenecid (irrespective of the indication) is not allowed \nduring the study. \n4.5 \nCRITERIA FOR PREMATURE WITHDRAWAL  \nThe investigator must discontinue treatment if the creatinine clearance is < 45 mL/min in \nadults using the Cockcroft-Gault method or < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Schwartz \nequation in children.  A lower limit of 45 mL/min for creatinine clearance will be used to \nallow for patients with a mild to moderate renal impairment.  The investigator must also \ndiscontinue treatment from all patients with intercurrent illnesses or adverse events \nsuggestive of hepatic decompensation.  The investigator also has the right to \ndiscontinue treatment in the event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, treatment \nfailure, protocol violations, administrative reasons, or other reasons. \nThe investigator must discontinue treatment with study drug if the patient is to be treated \nconcomitantly with another antiviral for influenza, for example, amantadine, rimantadine, \nlaninamivir, peramivir, or zanamavir.  However, all patients, including those who \ndiscontinue study drug prematurely and/or are treated with another antiviral, will be \nrequired to return for follow-up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose of study \ndrug (Day 15 and Day 40 assessments). \nPatients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n29 \n \nAn excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, \nunnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  Should a patient decide to \nwithdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations prior to \nwithdrawal as thoroughly as possible. \nThe investigator should contact the patient or a responsible relative either by telephone \nor through a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the \nwithdrawal.  A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient\u2019s withdrawal should be \nmade with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing from the study.  If the reason \nfor removal of a patient from the study is an Adverse Event, the principal specific event \nwill be recorded on the CRF. \nIn the case that the patient decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment [\u201crefuses \ntreatment\u201d], he/she should be asked if he/she can still be contacted for further \ninformation.  The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical \nrecords and in the CRF.  \n4.6 \nREPLACEMENT POLICY [ENSURING ADEQUATE NUMBERS \nOF EVALUABLE PATIENTS] \n4.6.1 \nFor Patients \nNo patient prematurely discontinued from the study for any reason will be replaced. \n4.6.2 \nFor Centers \nA center may be replaced for the following administrative reasons:   \n\u2013 \nExcessively slow recruitment \n\u2013 \nPoor protocol adherence \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

They will be required to come for their \nfollow-up visits on Day 15 and Day 40.  \ni. \nPatients who discontinue treatment prematurely will have an end of treatment (Day 11) \nassessment at the time of treatment discontinuation or the following day.  They will be \nrequired to attend their follow up visits approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose \n(Day 15 and Day 40 assessments).  \nj. \nPatients who discontinue during follow-up will have an end of follow-up (Day 40) assessment.  \nThis visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.   \nk. For patients who are unable to attend the clinic, swabs may be taken at home on those days \nwhere there is a home visit by site personnel. \nl. \nPlasma PK samples for assessment of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will be \ncollected from patients who give additional consent to participate in PK sampling using a \nsparse PK sampling approach (Section 5.5).  \nm. Serial PK samples taken at steady-state no earlier than Day 6 (i.e., not before the 11th dose) \nconsisting of as many of the four timepoints as possible:  within 30 minutes prior to the dose \nadministration, 1.5 hours \u00b1 30 minutes post dose, 4 hours \u00b1 60 minutes post dose, and \n8 hours \u00b1 1.5 hours post dose (for patients who have given additional consent). \n \n5.1 \nSCREENING EXAMINATION AND ELIGIBILITY SCREENING \nFORM  \nAll patients must provide written informed consent (assent where applicable) before any \nstudy specific assessments or procedures are performed.  Screening will take place at \nthe baseline visit prior to first dose.  However, if necessary, screening may take place \nthe day before the baseline visit, as long as the patient is randomized and receives \nhis/her first dose of study drug within 96 hours of influenza symptom onset. \nPatients will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria and those who fulfill all the \ninclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into the study.  Influenza \nRapid Diagnostic test, PCR, or viral culture for the purposes of inclusion criteria \nfulfillment will be done by the site or the local laboratory.  Historical CrCl values within \n3 months and CD4+ T-cell counts (where applicable) within 6 months before \nrandomization are acceptable for inclusion into the study.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

The patient randomization numbers will be generated by Roche or its \ndesignee and incorporated into double-blind labeling. \nThe investigator or designee will use the CRF pre-printed with the assigned patient \nnumber and enter the randomization number provided by IVRS for allocation to the \ntreatment groups in the appropriate place on each patient\u2019s CRF. \nRandomization will be stratified by transplant status (Yes; No); time between onset of \nsymptoms and treatment start (\u2264 48 hrs or > 48 hrs), influenza vaccination status \n(Yes; No) and patient\u2019s age (\u2264 12 years or > 12 years).  \n5.3 \nCLINICAL ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES \nAt all visits patients will receive the routine care for their primary illness.  Routine patient \ncare (including the adjustment of doses of any of the immunosuppressive drugs) will be \ndictated by tests performed locally at the trial site.  For patients unable to attend the \nclinic, provision will be made for swabbing to be conducted at home when there is a \nhome visit scheduled.  Training will be provided to site staff on how to perform this.  All \nsafety labs will be sent to a central laboratory.  Results for these laboratory parameters \nwill be used by the sponsor/designee to assess overall safety. \nAll assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of \nAssessments (Table 1).  Additional information regarding these procedures not provided \nin the Schedule of Assessments is provided below. \nBlood samples will be collected from patients who provide additional consent for PK \nsampling, as outlined in Section 5.5. \nStudy Day 1 \nThe baseline and study Day 1 assessment may be performed at the same visit.  \nLaboratory assessments (safety labs and nasal and throat swabs for virology) should be \nperformed after randomization but prior to the patient receiving first dose of study drug. \nStudy drug, patient diaries, and thermometers will be dispensed.  Patients or \nguardians/parents will be instructed on how to complete the patient diaries (Appendix 2 \nand Appendix 3), temperature recording, and treatment administration details, including \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n33 \n \ntime of each oseltamivir dose.  The first diary entries will be made at the site before the \nfirst dose of study drug.  \nBaseline nasal and throat swab samples will be assessed for the presence of \noseltamivir-resistance mutations.   \nThe date of the first dose of study drug is defined as study Day 1.  Once randomized, the \nfirst dose of study drug will be administered in the clinic.  Study Day 2 will begin at \n12 midnight of the same calendar day.  If the first dose of study drug is taken after 4 p.m. \non Day 1, the next dose of study drug will be taken in the morning of Day 2.  In this case, \nthe last dose of study drug will be taken on the morning of study Day 11.   \nIf the first dose of study drug is taken prior to 4 p.m. on Day 1, the next dose of study \ndrug should be taken in the evening of the same day (i.e., prior to midnight on the same \ncalendar day with a minimum of 7 hours between doses).  For these patients, the last \ndose of study drug will be taken in the evening of study Day 10.  More information on \ndosing is provided later (Section 6.1). \nStudy Days 2\u221211 \nStudy Day 2 will begin at 12 midnight of study Day 1.  \nIt is expected the study staff will maintain close contact with patients, especially during \nthe first few days of the study.  The study staff should inquire about any adverse events, \ncheck that the patient or parent/guardian is entering data into the patient diary properly, \nand assess drug compliance.  During the dosing period, diary symptoms should be \nassessed and temperature should be recorded at the same time that the study drug is \ntaken.  \nEnd of Treatment Day 11 \nThe end-of-treatment visit for all patients is on Day 11 (irrespective of whether they took \none or two doses on Day 1).  Study medication will be administered twice daily over \n10 days for a total of 20 doses.  Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will \nhave all Day 11 assessments completed at the time of discontinuation or the following \nday.  \nAfter all Day 11 study assessments are completed, a rapid diagnostic test will be \nperformed at this visit.  If the rapid diagnostic test is positive, the patient may be treated \nper standard of care at the discretion of the investigator.  If treatment is provided, this \nshould be captured in the CRF.  \nAll patients (including those who discontinue study drug prematurely and those who are \npositive for influenza on their rapid diagnostic test at the end of treatment visit) will be \nrequired to return for follow-up approximately 5 and 30 days after the last dose (Day 15 \nand Day 40 assessments).    \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n34 \n \nStudy Days 12\u221240 \nStudy Day 15 is an important visit as it is the first assessment of viral culture after \ncessation of treatment.  It is therefore important that this visit is completed.  \nEnd of Follow-Up Day 40  \nAll patients must attend an end of follow-up visit on Day 40.  \nIf the patient is withdrawn after completion of treatment (after the Day 11 assessment), \na termination visit should be arranged.  This visit should be the end of follow-up visit \nassessment [Day 40].  This visit must occur within 30 days of the last dose.  \nPatients or parents/guardians who do not return to the clinic will be contacted by \ntelephone to ascertain their health status or that of their child\u2019s, record information on \nadverse events, and to ask that they return the patient diary. \n5.3.1 \nSafety \nSafety is one of the primary endpoints of this study. Safety parameters include adverse \nevents, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluations.  \nPre-defined symptoms of influenza captured in the adult and pediatric diaries are not to \nbe reported as adverse events unless they can be further qualified.  Thus \u2018headache due \nto stress at work\u2019 is reported as an adverse event.  However, unexplained \u2018headache\u2019 is \nconsidered a predefined symptom related to influenza and not an adverse event.  \nAdverse events such as bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sinusitis are considered \nsecondary illnesses of influenza and should be recorded as adverse events. \nOther adverse events to be expected in the transplant population such as rejection and \ngraft versus host disease (in patients with HSCT) will also be collected as adverse \nevents.  Nasal and throat swab samples will be assessed from each study visit for the \npresence of oseltamivir-resistant mutations. \n5.3.2 \nEfficacy Assessments \nThe clinical efficacy parameters in this study are: \n1. \nSymptoms of influenza-like illness.  These are captured in the patient diary for both \nadults and children (Appendix 2) and (Appendix 3).  Influenza symptoms are graded \non a nominal scale from zero (absent/no problem) to 3 (severe or major problem).  \nA score of zero is considered asymptomatic.  The efficacy endpoint, time to \nalleviation of all symptoms is comprised of all the symptoms captured in the patient \ndiary.  \n2. \nTemperature.  This is captured in the patient diary.  Temperature is used for \nassessment of several efficacy endpoints.  \n \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n35 \n \n5.4 \nLABORATORY ASSESSMENTS \nThe laboratory assessments include those for safety, resistance, and efficacy. \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum \nchemistry and hematology, will be carried out at a central laboratory.  Serum chemistry \nassessments comprise AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea, and creatinine.  Hematology \nassessments include CBC and differential count.  The total volume of blood loss for \nlaboratory assessments will be approximately 20 mL for the entire duration of the study.  \nProtection of patient confidentiality (Section 16) will extend to any data generated from \nthe assay of these samples.  Biological samples collected from all patients may be \ninfectious and will be classified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nWhen clinically indicated, the investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be \nassessed at the local laboratory during the study to calculate creatinine clearance. \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza. \nThese are: \nNasal and throat swabs.  Two nasal and one throat swab will be collected as described \nin the Schedule of Assessments.  All swabs are sent to a central laboratory for RT-PCR \nand viral cultures.  Influenza virus shedding will be assessed.   \nAt the end of treatment (Day 11), a rapid diagnostic test is permitted for the diagnosis of \nongoing influenza.  \n5.5 \nPHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS/PHARMACODYNAMIC \nASSESSMENTS  \nParticipation in PK assessments is not compulsory for this study.  Blood samples for the \ncharacterization of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics using a \nsparse sampling strategy will be collected from all patients who provide additional \nconsent to participate in the PK assessments. \nBlood samples will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1) and \nas described below.  If these blood samples are collected at a home visit, site staff \nshould ensure the PK blood sample handling processing is not compromised.  The time \nand date of the dose and blood samples should be captured.  Further details on \npharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics can be found in Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n37 \n5.5.1 \nPharmacokinetic Assessments \nPlasma PK samples for assessment of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will be \ncollected at the following timepoints on Day 6, or any day after the 11th dose, using the \nfollowing sampling approach: \n\u2022 \nWithin 30 minutes prior to the dose administration (e.g., 8:30 a.m. if dosing is \nscheduled for 9:00 a.m.) \n\u2022 \n1.5 hours \u00b1 30 minutes post-dose (e.g., 10:30 a.m. \u00b1 30 min if dosing is scheduled \nfor 9:00 a.m.) \n\u2022 \n4 hours \u00b1 60 minutes post dose (e.g., 1:00 p.m. \u00b1 60 min if dosing is scheduled for \n9:00 a.m.) \n\u2022 \n8 hours \u00b1 1.5 hours post dose (e.g., 5:00 p.m. \u00b1 1.5 hr if dosing is scheduled for \n9:00 a.m.) \n \nFor adults and adolescents, approximately 2 mL of blood will be collected at each \ntimepoint; therefore, the total volume blood loss for PK assessments will be \napproximately 8 mL.  For pediatric patients, not less than approximately 0.6 mL of blood \nwill be collected at each timepoint; therefore, the total volume blood loss for PK \nassessments will be approximately 2.4 mL. \nThe samples from this study are classified as Biological Substance, Category B.  \nPlasma concentrations of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will be measured by \na specific and validated method.  Details on sampling procedures, sample storage, and \nshipment are provided in the Sampling Manual. \n5.5.2 \nPharmacodynamic Assessments \nNasal and throat swabs will be collected from individuals on the days specified in the \nschedule of assessments.  Specimens will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  As \nimmunocompromised patients are expected to shed virus for a longer duration, viral \nsamples will be collected at all visits.  The proportion of patients with viral shedding at \neach visit will be summarized. \n6. \nINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT  \nThe Investigational Medical Product in this study is oseltamivir dry powder (to be \nreconstituted to a concentration of 12 mg/mL or 6 mg/mL [the 6 mg/mL will only be \nused if applicable and not before 2015]) or 75 mg capsules and matching placebo. \nThe Investigational Medicinal Products will be supplied, packaged individually for each \nsubject and labeled in accordance with Roche Standard and local regulation by Roche \nClinical Trial Supply, Basel, Switzerland.  \n \n6.1 \nDOSE AND SCHEDULE OF STUDY DRUG \nOseltamivir will be given twice daily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.  The doses \nneed to be taken at 12 hourly intervals.  Under no circumstances is a patient allowed to \ntake two doses within 7 hours of each other.  \nPatients will be randomized to receive either conventional or double dose of study drug. \nConventional dose: \nChildren ages 1\u221212 years:  Oseltamivir syrup \n\u2264 15 kg   \n \n \n30 mg twice daily \n> 15\u221223 kg   \n \n45 mg twice daily \n> 23\u221240 kg \n \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg  \n \n \n75 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years):  Oseltamivir capsules  \n75 mg twice daily \nPatients randomized to the conventional dose will simultaneously receive matching \nplacebo so as to blind them and the investigator from the double dose arm.  \nDouble dose: \nChildren ages 1\u221212 years:  Oseltamivir syrup  \n\u2264 15 kg   \n \n \n60 mg twice daily \n> 15\u221223 kg   \n \n90 mg twice daily \n> 23\u221240 kg \n \n \n120 mg twice daily \n> 40 kg  \n \n \n150 mg twice daily \nAdults and adolescents (age \u2265 13 years):  Oseltamivir capsules  \n150 mg twice daily  \n6.1.1 \nDose Modifications \nNo dose modifications will be allowed on study. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n39 \n6.2 \nPREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF STUDY DRUG \nOseltamivir will be provided in two forms:  \n1. \nOseltamivir capsules containing 75 mg of active drug and packaging material \nconsisting of pregelatinized starch, povidone, talc, and sodium stearyl fumarate.  All \nparticipants 13 years and older will receive this dosage form.  Oseltamivir capsules \nshould be stored below 25\u00b0C [77\u00b0F].  Do not store refrigerated. \n2. \nA pediatric suspension containing 12 mg oseltamivir per mL or 6 mg oseltamivir \nper mL (the 6 mg/mL will only be used if applicable and not before 2015), of \nreconstituted solution and the following excipients:  sorbitol, titanium dioxide, sodium \nbenzoate, xanthan gum, monosodium citrate, saccharin sodium, and \nPermaseal11900-31 Tutti Frutti (flavor).  All participants 12 years and under will \nreceive this dosage form.  Oseltamivir dry powder for oral suspension [pediatric \nsyrup] should be stored below 30\u00b0C [86\u00b0F]).  Once reconstituted, the suspension \nshould not be used for longer than 10 days if stored at room temperature conditions \n(below 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F).  If stored under refrigerated conditions at 2\u22128\u00b0C (36\u221246\u00b0F) the \nsuspension should not be used for longer than 17 days.  The suspension is not \nsuitable for freezing. \nFor further details, refer to the Tamiflu\u00ae Investigator\u2019s Brochure. \nMatching placebo will be available as capsules and suspension.  Patients in the \nconventional dose arm will get the conventional dose and matching placebo so that they \nare blinded from the double dose arm.  \nEach patient will be dispensed a medication pack that will provide enough medication to \ncover 20 doses.  For patients randomized to the conventional dose arm, the medication \npack will contain a bottle of oseltamivir dry powder or a blister wallet with oseltamivir \ncapsules and matching placebo.  For patients randomized to the double dose arm, the \nmedication pack will contain two bottles of oseltamivir dry powder or two blister wallets \nwith oseltamivir capsules.  Irrespective of the treatment group the patient is randomized \nto, for each dose the patient will take the same amount from both bottles or blister \nwallets provided in the medication pack such that the sum of the amounts from each \nimmediate container constitutes one dose. \nOne dose is to be administered twice per day at approximately 12-hour intervals with a \nlight snack or glass of milk or fruit juice.  The first dose of study drug will be administered \nin the clinic at the time of randomization. \n6.3 \nBLINDING AND UNBLINDING \nRandomization will be administered by a central randomization center.  \nThe Randomization List will not be available at the study center, to the study monitors, \nproject statisticians, or to the project team at Roche.  Emergency codes, or another \nadequate method of unblinding, will be implemented before study start, if the identity of \n \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n40 \nthe test medication is necessary for patient management in the case of a serious \nadverse event.  Any request from the investigator for information about the treatment \nadministered to study patients for another purpose must be discussed with \nRoche/designee.  \nAs per regulatory reporting requirement, Roche/designee will unblind the identity of the \nstudy drug for all unexpected [as per IB] serious adverse events that are considered by \nthe investigator to be related to study drug.  Details of patients who are unblinded during \nthe study will be included in the Clinical Study Report. \nAll other individuals directly involved in this study will remain blinded until the final \nanalysis of the primary parameter.  \nThe randomization will be stratified by transplant status, duration of symptoms, influenza \nvaccination status and age and will be provided by the Roche randomization group for \nthe IVRS vendor.   \n6.4 \nASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE \nAccountability and patient compliance will be assessed by maintaining adequate \u201cdrug \ndispensing\u201d and return records.  \nPatients will be asked to return all used and unused drug supply containers at the end of \nthe treatment as a measure of compliance.  \nA Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should contain the following \ninformation: \n\u2022 \nthe identification of the patient [randomization and medication numbers] to whom \nthe study drug was dispensed \n\u2022 \nthe date[s], quantity of the study drug dispensed to the patient \n\u2022 \nthe date[s] and quantity of the study drug returned by the patient \n \nThis inventory must be available for inspection by the Monitor.  All supplies, including \npartially used or empty containers and the dispensing logs, must be returned to the \nmonitor at the end of the study. \n6.5 \nDESTRUCTION OF STUDY DRUG \nLocal or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used \ninvestigational product for safety reasons.  In these cases, it may be acceptable for \ninvestigational site staff to destroy dispensed investigational product before a monitoring \ninspection provided that source document verification is performed on the remaining \ninventory and reconciled against the documentation of quantity shipped, dispensed, \nreturned, and destroyed.  Written authorization must be obtained from the sponsor or \ndesignee at study start up before destruction. \n \nWritten documentation of destruction must contain the following: \n\u2013 \nIdentity [batch numbers or patient numbers] of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 \nQuantity of investigational product[s] destroyed \n\u2013 \nDate of destruction \n\u2013 \nMethod of destruction \n\u2013 \nName and signature of responsible person [or company] who destroyed \ninvestigational products[s] \n \n7. \nSAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE \n7.1 \nADVERSE EVENTS AND LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES \n7.1.1 \nClinical AEs \nPer the International Conference of Harmonization [ICH], an Adverse Event (AE) is any \nuntoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a \npharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with \nthis treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign [including \nan abnormal laboratory finding], symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use \nof a medicinal [investigational] product, whether or not considered related to the \nmedicinal [investigational] product.  Pre-existing conditions that worsen during a study \nare to be reported as AEs.  Influenza signs and symptoms reported on the patient diary \nwill be summarized as efficacy endpoints and need not be captured as adverse events.  \nHowever, secondary illnesses due to influenza must be reported as adverse events.  \n7.1.1.1 \nIntensity  \nAll clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of \nthe CRF.   \nIntensity of AEs will be graded on a four-point scale [mild, moderate, severe, \nlife-threatening] and reported in detail on the CRF.   \nMild \ndiscomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. \nModerate \ndiscomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity. \nSevere \ninability to work or perform normal daily activity. \nLife Threatening \nrepresents an immediate threat to life.   \n \n7.1.1.2 \nDrug - Adverse Event Relationship \nRelationship of the AE to the treatment should always be assessed by the investigator.  \nDescription of scales can be found in Appendix 4. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n41 \n \n7.1.1.3 \nSerious Adverse Events [Immediately Reportable to Roche] \nCertain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate \nmeasures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report \nsuch events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take \nplace more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list \nof events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning \nof the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: \n\u2022 \nSerious adverse events \n\u2022 \nPregnancies \n \nA Serious Adverse Event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect, or precaution.  It is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 \nis fatal; [results in death; NOTE:  death is an outcome, not an event].  \n\u2013 \nis Life-Threatening [NOTE:  the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer \nto an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more \nsevere]. \n\u2013 \nrequired in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 \nresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 \nis a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 \nis medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \n \nThe full requirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, \nDefinitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to \n(Appendix 5). \n7.1.2 \nTreatment and Follow-up of AEs  \nAEs, especially those for which the relationship to test \u201cdrug\u201d is not \u201cunrelated,\u201d should \nbe followed up until they have returned to baseline status or stabilized.  If a clear \nexplanation is established it should be recorded on the CRF.   \n7.1.3 \nLaboratory Test Abnormalities \nLaboratory test results will appear printed on laboratory reports provided to the site from \nthe central laboratory.  \nAny laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event [SAE] \nshould be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the CRF. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n42 \n \nAny treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result which is clinically significant, \ni.e., meeting one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded as a single \ndiagnosis on the AE page in the CRF: \n\u2022 \nAccompanied by clinical symptoms. \n\u2022 \nLeading to a change in study drug [e.g., dose modification, interruption, or \npermanent discontinuation]. \n\u2022 \nRequiring a change in concomitant therapy [e.g., addition of, interruption of, \ndiscontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy, or \ntreatment]. \n \n7.1.4 \nFollow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values \nIn the event of medically significant unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, the \ntests should be repeated and followed up until they have returned to the normal range \nand/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  If a clear explanation is \nestablished it should be recorded on the CRF.  \n7.2 \nHANDLING OF SAFETY PARAMETERS \n7.2.1 \nReporting of Serious Adverse Events [Immediately Reportable] \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious [as defined in \nSection 7.1.1.3 above] and which occurs during the course of the study, regardless of \nthe treatment arm, occurring from the enrollment visit (start of study screening \nprocedures), must be reported to Roche or designee immediately (i.e., no more than \n24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event [expedited reporting]). \nRelated Serious Adverse Events MUST be collected and reported regardless of the time \nelapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  \nUnrelated Serious Adverse Events must be collected and reported during the study and \nup until the follow-up visit.  \nThe definition and reporting requirements of ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data \nManagement, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be \nadhered to (Appendix 5).  The serious adverse events should be reported in the most \nup-to-date version of the SAE form. \n7.2.2 \nPregnancy  \nA female patient must be instructed to stop taking the test \u201cdrug\u201d and immediately inform \nthe investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.  The investigator should \nreport all pregnancies immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator \nbecomes aware of the pregnancy) to the Sponsor or designee, using the most \nup-to-date version of the pregnancy form.  The investigator should counsel the patient, \nand discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the \nfetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n43 \n \nPregnancies occurring within 28 days of treatment completion should be reported to \nRoche.  \n7.3 \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \nEvents such as convulsions and delirium (including symptoms such as altered level of \nconsciousness, confusion, abnormal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, \nanxiety, nightmares) have been reported during oseltamivir use in patients with influenza, \npredominately in children and adolescents.  In rare cases, these events resulted in \naccidental injury.  The contribution of oseltamivir to those events is unknown.  Such \nevents have also been reported in patients with influenza who were not taking \noseltamivir.  Patients, especially children and adolescents, should be closely monitored \nfor signs of abnormal behavior. \nPlease refer to the attached Investigator\u2019s Brochure for additional warnings, precautions, \nand other reported adverse events. \n8. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN \nFull details of all planned analyses will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis \nPlan (SAP) for the safety and efficacy variables and in the Resistance Plan for the \ndevelopment of resistance.  The methods described below are an outline of the main \nplanned analyses.  For continuous endpoints summary statistics including mean, \nstandard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be derived for each treatment \ngroup.  For categorical data, the number and percentage of events and/or patients for \neach treatment group will be presented. \n8.1 \nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY STUDY ENDPOINTS \n8.1.1 \nPrimary Endpoints \nThe primary endpoints for safety will be descriptive assessments of:  \n\u2022 \nAdverse events \n\u2022 \nPhysical examination  \n\u2022 \nVital signs \n\u2022 \nClinical laboratory evaluations  \n\u2022 \nTissue rejection and/or graft versus host disease in transplant patients \n \nThe primary endpoint of development of resistance will be determined from the \ngenotypic and phenotypic variables measured post baseline and is described further in \nthe Resistance Plan. \n8.1.2 \nSecondary Endpoints \nThe following endpoints will be analyzed descriptively at relevant timepoints. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n44 \n \nThe pharmacodynamics assessments based on nose and throat swabs, collected on the \ndays specified in the schedule of assessments: \n\u2022 \nShedding virus by culture and RT-PCR  \n\u2022 \nViral load by culture (log10TCID50/mL) and quantitative RT-PCR \n\u2022 \nIndividual symptom scores  \n\u2022 \nThe time (hours) from first dose of study drug until resolution of fever  \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis) \nat any time during the study \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of secondary illnesses (otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis) \nat any time during the study that are treated with antibiotics \n\u2022 \nInitiation of treatment with antibiotics after randomization  \n\u2022 \nHospitalization, and for those who are hospitalized, the duration of hospitalization \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of rejection or GVHD \n \nThe following are the model-predicted PK secondary endpoints for oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate: \n\u2022 \nSteady-state area under the concentration\u2013time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12) \n\u2022 \nMaximum plasma concentration (Cmax)  \n\u2022 \nTrough plasma concentration (Ctrough)  \n \nThe following model-predicted PK endpoints may be included, if appropriate:  \n\u2022 \nElimination half-life (t1/2) \n\u2022 \nTime to maximum concentration (tmax) \n\u2022 \nElimination constant (ke) \n\u2022 \nApparent clearance (CL/F) \n\u2022 \nApparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) \n\u2022 \nApparent total clearance of metabolite (CLm) \n\u2022 \nLast measurable concentration (Clast) and time to last measurable concentration (tlast)  \n \n8.2 \nSTATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS  \n8.2.1 \nStatistical Model  \n8.2.1.1 \nTime to Event Variables \nA non-parametric model will be assumed with estimation of medians based on \nKaplan-Meier methods.  Patients without alleviation of symptoms will have their time \ncensored at the last available observation that a complete assessment was made. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n45 \n \n8.2.1.2 \nDichotomous Variables and Viral Load  \nFor the endpoints defined dichotomously in terms of events or symptoms including the \ndevelopment of resistance, it will be assumed that the number of patients experiencing \nthe event or exhibiting the symptom will have a binomial distribution. \nFor the continuous endpoints of viral load at Days 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 15, and 40, no model \nwill be assumed.  \n8.2.2 \nSample Size \nThe sample size has been chosen to provide an adequate number of patients to \nestimate the development of resistance with reasonable precision.  Assuming that 90% \nof enrolled patients will have laboratory-confirmed influenza, there will be 75 patients in \neach treatment arm in the population evaluable for the development of resistance.  The \nfollowing table shows the 95% Pearson-Clopper confidence intervals that would result \nwith a sample size of 75 patients in a treatment arm if certain event rates are observed \nin the study. \nDuring the study, the number of influenza A virus infected patients and the rate of \ndevelopment resistance will be monitored in a blinded fashion in order to ensure a \nreasonable precision for the estimation.  An additional number of patients may be \nenrolled if necessary. \nObserved Rate (%) \n95% Confidence Interval \n0.0 \n0.0%\u22124.8% \n1.3 \n0.0%\u22127.2% \n2.7 \n0.3%\u22129.3% \n5.3 \n1.5%\u221213.1% \n10.7 \n4.7%\u221219.9% \n \nA total of 83 patients will be enrolled per arm and will be evaluable for the assessment of \nsafety.  This number of patients would provide estimates of adverse event rates with \nsimilar precision. \n8.2.3 \nHypothesis Testing  \nFormal hypothesis testing will not be performed; any comparisons between groups will \nbe based on comparison of confidence intervals.  \n8.2.4 \nAnalysis Populations \nThree main patient populations will be used for the analysis of data from this study; the \nSafety Population, the Intent-to treat Population and the Intent-to-Treat Infected \nPopulation.  Detailed definitions of these populations will be given in the SAP.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n46 \n \n8.2.4.1 \nIntent to Treat Population \nAll patients randomized will be included in the intent-to-treat population [Patients will be \nassigned to treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes]. \n8.2.4.2 \nIntent to Treat Infected Population \nAll patients randomized and with laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, excluding \npatients infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline, will be included in the \nintent-to-treat influenza infected population [Patients will be assigned to treatment \ngroups as randomized for analysis purposes]. \nThe ITTI Population will be the primary population for the summary and analysis of the \ndevelopment of resistance and the efficacy variables. \n8.2.4.3 \n Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Patient Population \nThe Pharmacokinetic evaluable patient population (PKEP) population comprises all \npatients in the ITT population who have at least one post-dose drug concentration \nmeasurement at a scheduled visit timepoint.  Patients may be excluded from the PKEP \npopulation if they significantly violate the inclusion or exclusion criteria, deviate \nsignificantly from the protocol, or have unavailable or incomplete data that may influence \nthe PK analysis.  \nDecisions on patient exclusion from the PK analysis will be made prior to database \nclosure by the clinical pharmacologist.  Excluded patients will be documented along with \nthe reason for exclusion. \n8.2.4.4 \nSubpopulations \nA subpopulation of the ITTI population will be defined comprising patients who received \ntheir first dose of study drug within 48 hours of influenza symptom onset for the \ncomparison of efficacy endpoints with the age appropriate placebo treated patients \n(pediatric or adult) from the registration trials. \n8.2.5 \nSafety Data Analysis \nThe safety analysis population will include all patients who receive at least one dose of \nstudy drug and had a safety assessment performed post randomization.  All safety \nvariables will be summarized and presented in tables based on this safety population: \n\u2022 \nAdverse events \n\u2022 \nPhysical examination \n\u2022 \nVital signs \n\u2022 \nClinical laboratory evaluations \n\u2022 \nRejection and/or graft versus host disease \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n47 \n \n \n8.2.6 \nAnalysis of Resistance \nFor the summary of the development of resistance for each treatment arm, \n95% confidence intervals will be provided with the estimated rates.  Further details are \navailable in the Resistance Plan for NV20234.  These data will be summarized in a \nreport separate from the final study report. \n8.2.7 \nEfficacy Analysis \nFor the analysis of time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms, the following two \nassessments will be made independently of each other and without regard to the \noutcomes in each case. \n\u2022 \nComparison to placebo control from pivotal registration trials  \nFrom the integrated efficacy database associated with the oseltamivir \ntreatment approval, a population of placebo-treated patients will be \nestablished that is comparable to the subpopulation of patients in the current \nstudy whose first dose of study drug was within 48 hours of symptom onset.  \nFor this population, a median time to resolution of all clinical influenza \nsymptoms will be determined along with its 95% confidence interval. \nThe median time to resolution of all influenza symptoms will be determined for \neach treatment group, along with its 95% confidence interval.   \n\u2022 \nThe two dose groups will be compared to each other by estimating the difference in \nthe median times to alleviation of symptoms and deriving an associated \n95% confidence interval. \n  \nFor the dichotomous endpoints, the proportion of patients experiencing the event or \nsymptom, and its associated 95% confidence interval will be derived for each treatment \ngroup.  Where possible, the corresponding confidence intervals from the placebo control \npopulation will be presented for comparison to those derived for the active treatment \ngroups in this trial. \nThe continuous secondary endpoint time to resolution of fever will be analyzed as for the \ntime to alleviation of all symptoms.  \n8.2.7.1 \nExclusion of Data from Analysis \nEfficacy data collected from any patient who begins treatment with another antiviral for \ninfluenza (for example, amantadine, rimantadine, laninamivir, peramivir, or zanamavir), \nafter the other antiviral treatment commences, will be excluded from the primary and \nsecondary efficacy analyses.  Such patients will be considered failures to oseltamivir \ntreatment in the analyses.  Further details will be provided in the SAP. \n8.2.7.2 \nInterim Analysis \nNo interim analyses are planned.  \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n48 \n \n8.2.8 \nOther Analyses \nFurther exploratory analyses will be detailed in the SAP. \n8.3 \nPHARMACOKINETIC AND PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSIS \n8.3.1 \nPharmacokinetic Analysis \nThe primary study variables are the model-derived PK parameters:  steady-state AUC, \nCmax, and Ctrough of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. \nIndividual and mean plasma concentrations at each sampling timepoint for oseltamivir \nand oseltamivir carboxylate will be presented by listings and descriptive summary \nstatistics, including means, geometric means, medians, ranges, standard deviations, and \ncoefficients of variation.  Individual and mean concentration-versus-time profiles will be \nplotted on linear and semi-logarithmic scales. \nPlasma concentration data from sparse sampling will be analyzed using an established \npopulation PK model to determine key exposure parameters (e.g., Cmax, Ctrough, and \nAUC).  For immunocompromised children aged 1 to 18 years, plasma oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate concentration will be modeled in NONMEM using a structure \nsimilar to a comprehensive population PK model, which was previously developed using \nplasma data from non-immunocompromised children and adults (ages 1 to 80 years) \n[36].  The basic structure consists of a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption \nand direct conversion of oseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate, while a 1-compartment \nmodel is used to account for the renal elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate from the \nplasma.  Body weight, evaluated using a power function and centered around 70 kg, is a \nstatistically significant predictor of the CL/F for oseltamivir and both CL/F and apparent \nvolume of distribution (Vc/F) for oseltamivir carboxylate.  For oseltamivir carboxylate, \nCrCl is also a significant predictor of CL/F, while Vc/F decreases linearly with age. \n8.3.2 \nPharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis  \nIf feasible, exposure-response relationships [43] will be evaluated between independent \nvariables of exposure (e.g., AUC, Cmin) and dependent variables including continuous \n(area under the viral titer curve, and peak viral titer) and time-to-event (cessation of viral \nshedding) virologic endpoints.  Exploratory PK/PD analyses will be performed using \nappropriate methodologies.  In order to account for potential non-linearity and \nnon-monotonicity, each continuous independent variable (e.g., AUC) will be evaluated in \nits original form, as a categorical variable based on quartiles, as two- and three-group \ncategorical variables. \n9. \nDATA QUALITY ASSURANCE \nThe overall procedures for quality assurance of clinical study data are described in the \nRoche Standard Operational Procedures. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n49 \n \nAccurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross\u2013check of \nthe CRFs against the investigator\u2019s records by the study monitor [source document \nverification] and the maintenance of a drug\u2013dispensing log by the investigator.  \nThe data collected will be entered into the study database from the working copy of the \nCRF faxed from the site. \nA comprehensive validation check program will verify the data and discrepancy reports \nwill be generated accordingly for resolution by the investigator.  As patients complete the \nstudy [or prematurely withdraw] and their signed CRFs become available, a second data \nentry will be performed from the original, signed CRF.  A comparison check will be run to \nidentify and resolve any discrepancies between the first and second data entry. \nThroughout the study the Study Management Team [SMT] will review data according to \nthe SMT Data Review Plan as described in the Data Quality Plan.  \n9.1 \nASSIGNMENT OF PREFERRED TERMS AND ORIGINAL \nTERMINOLOGY \nFor classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by the sponsor to the \noriginal terms entered on the CRF, using the current version of MedDRA (Medical \nDictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology) for adverse events and diseases and \nthe INN (International Non-Proprietary name) drug terms and procedures dictionary for \ntreatments and surgical and medical procedures. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n53 \n \nPART II: ETHICS AND GENERAL STUDY ADMINISTRATION \n11. \nETHICAL ASPECTS \n11.1 \nLOCAL REGULATIONS/DECLARATION OF HELSINKI \nThe investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformance with the \nprinciples of the \u201cDeclaration of Helsinki\u201d or with the laws and regulations of the country \nin which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the \nindividual.  The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in \u201cGuideline for Good \nClinical Practice\u201d ICH Tripartite Guideline [January 1997] or with local law if it affords \ngreater protection to the patient.  For studies conducted in the European \nUnion/European Economic Area countries, the investigator will ensure compliance with \nthe EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC].  For studies conducted in the United States \nor under U.S. IND, the investigator will additionally ensure that the basic principles of \n\u201cGood Clinical Practice\u201d as outlined in the current version of 21 CFR, subchapter D, \npart 312, \u201cResponsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators\u201d, part 50, \u201cProtection of Human \nSubjects\u201d, and part 56, \u201cInstitutional Review Boards\u201d, are adhered to. \nIn other countries where \u201cGuideline for Good Clinical Practice\u201d exists, Roche and the \ninvestigators will strictly ensure adherence to the stated provisions. \n11.2 \nINFORMED CONSENT  \nIt is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator \n[if acceptable by local regulations], to obtain written informed consent from each patient \nparticipating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated \nbenefits, and the potential hazards of the study.  For patients not qualified or incapable \nof giving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legally acceptable \nrepresentative.  In the case where both the patient and his/her legally acceptable \nrepresentative are unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the \nentire informed consent discussion.  After the patient and representative have orally \nconsented to participation in the trial, the witness\u2019 signature on the form will attest that \nthe information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood.  The \ninvestigator or designee must also explain that the patients are completely free to refuse \nto enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason.  The Case Report \nForms [CRFs] for this study contain a section for documenting informed patient consent, \nand this must be completed appropriately.  If new safety information results in significant \nchanges in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and \nupdated if necessary.  All patients [including those already being treated] should be \ninformed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form, and give their consent \nto continue in the study. \nIf children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the study, they should \nalso be informed and should also provide their written consent. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n54 \n \n11.3 \nINDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEES/INSTITUTIONAL \nREVIEW BOARD  \nIndependent Ethics Committees [non-U.S.]:  This protocol and any accompanying \nmaterial provided to the patient [such as patient information sheets or descriptions of the \nstudy used to obtain informed consent] as well as any advertising or compensation given \nto the patient, will be submitted by the investigator to an Independent Ethics Committee.  \nApproval from the committee must be obtained before starting the study and should be \ndocumented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the committee \nmet and granted the approval. \nAny modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the Independent Ethics \nCommittee approval must also be submitted by the investigator to the Committee in \naccordance with local procedures and regulatory requirements. \nWhen no local review board exists, the investigator is expected to submit the protocol to \na regional committee.  If no regional committee exists, Roche will assist the investigator \nin submitting the protocol to the European Ethics Review Committee. \nInstitutional Review Board [U.S.]:  It is the understanding of the sponsor that this \nprotocol [and any modifications] as well as appropriate consent procedures, will be \nreviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board.  This board must operate in \naccordance with the current Federal Regulations.  A letter or certificate of approval will \nbe sent by the investigator to the Sponsor or designee prior to initiation of the study, and \nalso whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made. \n12. \nCONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL \nProtocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between \nan appropriate representative of the sponsor and the investigator [investigator \nrepresentative[s] in the case of a multicenter trial].  Protocol modifications must be \nprepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially reviewed and approved by the \nClinical Science Leader/Clinical Pharmacologist and Biostatistician. \nAll protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Independent Ethics \nCommittee or Institutional Review Board for information and approval in accordance with \nlocal requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required.  Approval must be awaited \nbefore any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an \nimmediate hazard to trial patients, or when the change[s] involves only logistical or \nadministrative aspects of the trial [e.g., change in monitor[s], change of telephone \nnumber[s]. \n13. \nCONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY \nBoth the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  \nShould this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual study \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n55 \n \nbasis after review and consultation.  In terminating the study, Roche and the investigator \nwill assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient\u2019s interests. \n14. \nSTUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS, AND RECORD KEEPING \n14.1 \nINVESTIGATOR'S FILES/RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS \nThe Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of \nthe study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These \ndocuments should be classified into two different separate categories [1] Investigator's \nStudy File, and [2] patient clinical source documents. \nThe Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, Case Report and \nQuery Forms, Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and \ngovernmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, \nstaff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate \ndocuments/correspondence, etc.  \nPatient clinical source documents [usually defined by the project in advance to record \nkey efficacy/safety parameters independent of the CRFs] would include patient \nhospital/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original \nlaboratory reports, ECG, EEG, X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed \ninformed consent forms, consultant letters, and patient screening and enrollment logs.  \nThe Investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least \n15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study.  After that period of time the \ndocuments may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.  \nShould the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them \nto another location, Roche must be notified in advance. \nIf the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site \nfor any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the \nInvestigator and Roche to store these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that \nthey can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where \nsource documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies \nshould be made for storing outside of the site. \n14.2 \nSOURCE DOCUMENTS AND BACKGROUND DATA \nThe investigator shall supply the sponsor or designee on request with any required \nbackground data from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly \nimportant when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are suspected.  In \ncase of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, \nit is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that patient \nconfidentiality is protected. \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n56 \n \n14.3 \nAUDITS AND INSPECTIONS \nThe investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made \navailable to appropriately qualified personnel from the Roche Pharma Development \nQuality Assurance Unit or its designees or to health authority inspectors after \nappropriate notification.  The verification of the CRF data must be by direct inspection of \nsource documents. \n14.4 \nCASE REPORT FORMS \nFor each patient enrolled, a CRF must be completed and signed by the principal \ninvestigator or authorized delegate from the study staff.  This also applies to records for \nthose patients who fail to complete the study [even during a pre-randomization screening \nperiod if a CRF was initiated].  If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be \nnoted on the CRF.  If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a \ntreatment-limiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. \nAll forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink and must be legible.  Errors \nshould be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change \ninitialed and dated by the investigator or his/her authorized delegate.  The investigator \nshould ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported \nto the sponsor or designee in the CRFs and in all required reports. \n15. \nMONITORING THE STUDY \nIt is understood that the responsible Roche monitor [or designee] will contact and visit \nthe investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the various records \nof the trial [CRFs and other pertinent data] provided that patient confidentiality is \nmaintained in accord with local requirements. \nIt will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout \nthe study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and \naccuracy of the data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to \nlaboratory test reports and other patient records needed to verify the entries on the CRF.  \nThe investigator [or his/her deputy] agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that \nany problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. \n16. \nCONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND PATIENT \nRECORDS \nThe investigator must assure that patients\u2019 anonymity will be maintained and that their \nidentities are protected from unauthorized parties.  On CRFs or other documents (both \npaper and electronic) submitted to the sponsor or designee, patients should not be \nidentified by their names but by an identification code.  The investigator should keep a \npatient enrollment log showing codes, names, and addresses.  The investigator should \nOseltamivir\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nProtocol NV20234, Version F \n57 \n \nmaintain documents not for submission to Roche, e.g., patients\u2019 written consent forms, in \nstrict confidence. \n17. \nPUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE \nSECRETS \nThe results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is \nforeseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Roche prior to \nsubmission.  This allows the sponsor or designee to protect proprietary information and \nto provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be \navailable to the investigator. \nIn accord with standard editorial and ethical practice, Roche will generally support \npublication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In \nthis case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. \nAny formal publication of the study in which input of Roche personnel exceeded that of \nconventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and \nthe appropriate Roche personnel.  Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

It is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 \nis fatal; [results in death] [NOTE:  death is an outcome, not an event]. \n\u2013 \nis Life-Threatening    [NOTE:  the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer \nto an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more \nsevere]. \n\u2013 \nrequired in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 \nresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 \nis a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 \nis medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \nMedical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited \nreporting to the sponsor or designee is appropriate in other situations, such as important \nmedical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or \nhospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one \nof the outcomes listed in the definitions above.  These situations should also usually be \nconsidered serious. \nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for \nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; \nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \nAn unexpected AE is one, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the \napplicable product information. \nCausality is initially assessed by the investigator.  For Serious Adverse Events, possible \ncauses of the event is indicated by selecting one or more options.  (Check all that apply)  \n\u2013 \nPre-existing/Underlying disease - specify  \n\u2013 \nStudy treatment \u2013 specify the drug(s) related to the event \n\u2013 \nOther treatment (concomitant or previous) \u2013 specify \n\u2013 \nProtocol-related procedure \n\u2013 \nOther (e.g., accident, new or intercurrent illness) - specify \nThe term severe is a measure of intensity, thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  \nFor example, nausea of several hours' duration may be rated as severe, but may not be \nclinically serious. \nOseltamivir\u2014F.

In addition, a serious adverse event that occurs after this time, if considered \nrelated to test \u201cdrug\u201d, should be reported. \nSuch preliminary reports will be followed by detailed descriptions later, which will include \ncopies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested \nand applicable. \nFor serious adverse events, the following must be assessed and recorded on the AEs \npage of the CRF:  intensity, relationship to test substance, action taken, and outcome to \ndate. \nThe investigator must notify the Ethics Review Committee/Institutional Review Board of \na serious adverse event in writing as soon as is practical and in accordance with \ninternational and local laws and regulations. \nROCHE LOCAL COUNTRY CONTACT for SAEs:  Local Monitor  \nROCHE HEADQUARTERS CONTACT for SAEs:  Clinical Operations/Clinical Science  \nTo ensure the safety of study patients, an Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will \naccess the Roche Medical Emergency List, escalate emergency medical calls, provide \nmedical translation service (if necessary), connect the investigator with a Roche Medical \nMonitor, and track all calls.
