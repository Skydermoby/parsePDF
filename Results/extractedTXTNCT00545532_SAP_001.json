Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n6 \n1. \nBACKGROUND \nStudy NV20234 is a post-authorization commitment (PAC) of Tamiflu\u00ae \nregistrations agreed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and a post-\nmarketing requirement (PMR) of Tamiflu registrations agreed with the US Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA).  It also forms part of the EMA Paediatric \nInvestigational Plan (PIP). \nThis Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) is based on Protocol Version F (18 June \n2014).   \n2. \nSTUDY DESIGN \nStudy NV20234 is a double-blind, randomized, stratified multi-center trial of \nconventional and double dose oseltamivir in immuno-compromised (IC) patients. \nThe conventional dose in adults (\u226518 years of age) and adolescents (from \u226513 to \n<18 years of age) is 75 mg twice daily (BID) for 10 days. In children (from 1 to \n<13 years of age) the conventional doses are 30, 45, or 60 mg BID for 10 days \nbased on body weight. Immunocompromised (IC) patients who develop an \ninfluenza-like illness with confirmed influenza from a positive rapid diagnostic \ntest, PCR, or viral culture will be enrolled during the influenza season. Patients \nwill be stratified by: \n\u25cf \nTransplant type: hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] vs. solid organ \ntransplant [SOT] (Protocol Version A and B) or transplant status yes vs. no \n(Protocol Version C onwards). \n\u25cf \nThe time between onset of influenza symptoms and treatment start (up to 48 \nhours) (\u2264 24 hours vs. >24 hours) (Protocol Version A and B) or the time \nbetween onset of influenza symptoms and treatment start (up to 96 hours) \n(\u2264 48 hours vs.  > 48 hours) (Protocol Version C onwards). \n\u25cf \n Influenza vaccination status for current influenza season (yes vs. no). \n\u25cf \n Age (\u2264 12 years vs. >12 years). \nSee section 4.4.5 for further description of subgroup analyses. \n \n2.1 \nPROTOCOL SYNOPSIS \nThe Protocol Synopsis is in Appendix 1.  For additional details, see the Schedule \nof Assessments in Appendix 2. \n2.2 \nOUTCOME MEASURES \nAll endpoints (safety, resistance, efficacy and PK) are defined in the SAP \n(descriptions of the endpoints are in Section 2 and the statistical methods used to \ndescribe the endpoints are described in Section 4). There are two co-primary \nendpoints \u2013 safety/tolerability and resistance. It is worth noting that the primary \nendpoint of this study changed during the course of the study.  \u2018Time to \nResolution of All Influenza Symptoms\u2019 was the primary endpoint in versions A \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n7 \nand B of the protocol.  However, this endpoint was relegated to a secondary \nendpoint to reflect the change in objectives introduced in Protocol Version C. \nBaseline is defined for all endpoints as the pre-dose reading on Day 1.   \n2.2.1 \nPrimary Efficacy Outcome Measures \nNot applicable as efficacy is not the primary objective.  \n2.2.2 \nSecondary Efficacy Outcome Measures \nSecondary efficacy outcome measures are defined below. \n2.2.2.1 \nSymptoms \n\u25cf \nTime to Resolution (TTR) of All Symptoms in adolescents and adults is \ndefined as the time from treatment initiation to the start of the 24 hour period \nin which all seven symptoms have scores \u2264 1 (mild) and remain \u22641 for at least \n21.5 hours. Patients with symptom scores \u2264 1 at baseline, which remain \u22641 for \nat least 21.5 hours thereafter, will have a TTR of all symptoms set to missing. \nPatients with symptom scores > 1 at baseline followed immediately by \nscores \u22641 for at least 21.5 hours will have a TTR of all symptoms set to zero. \nBaseline (time zero) is defined as the time of symptom scores prior to first \ndose. For any subjects who have baseline scores missing, a subsequent set \nof symptom scores that is <12 hours post dose will be used. In order to \ngauge whether the previous action introduces a bias, a sensitivity analysis \nwill exclude patients who do not meet the strict definition of baseline \nsymptoms. Records in which all baseline symptoms are mild, i.e. \u22641, but any \nrises above 1 after first treatment will be set to missing. Posterior intermittent \ncycles of relapsing and recovery will be ignored. \n\u25cf \nTTR of All Symptoms (children) is defined as the time from treatment \ninitiation to the start of the 24 hour period in which all 18 symptoms items \nhave scores \u22641 (minor or no problem) and remain \u22641 for at least 21.5 hours. If \na score of 4 (\u201cdo not know\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d) occurs at any assessment \nduring the study for any given symptom, the assessment will not be included \nin the calculation of the resolution of all CARIFS symptoms. Patients with \nsymptom scores \u22641 at baseline which remain \u22641 for at least 21.5 hours \nthereafter will have a TTR of all symptoms set to missing. Patients with \nsymptom scores \u22641 at baseline followed immediately by scores \u22641 for at least \n21.5 hours will have a TTR of all symptoms set to zero. As above, records in \nwhich all baseline symptoms are mild, i.e. \u22641, but any rises above 1 after first \ntreatment will be set to missing. Posterior intermittent cycles of relapsing and \nrecovery will be ignored. \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n8 \n\u25cf \nArea Under the Effect-Time Curve (AUE) for all symptoms (adults only). This \nwill be calculated from baseline (symptom score prior to start of study drug \nor, if missing, before 12 h after starting treatment) to the time at which all \nsymptoms are first alleviated, i.e. \u22641. Totals scores will be tracked over time. \nThe AUE of these average scores is then calculated for each subject using \nthe trapezoidal rule. The median of those AUE will be compared between \ngroups using CI. \n\u25cf \nTTR of Individual Symptoms (all patients with baseline symptom scores > 1) \nis defined as the time from treatment initiation to the start of the 24 hour \nperiod at which a specific symptom score is \u22641 and remains \u22641 for at least \n21.5 hours. For children, if a score of 4 (\u201cdo not know\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d) \noccurs at any assessment during the study for any given symptom(s), the \nassessment will not be included in calculating the TTR. Patients with \nsymptom scores \u22641 at baseline which remain \u22641 for at least 21.5 hours \nthereafter will have a TTR set to missing. Patients with symptom scores >1 at \nbaseline followed immediately by scores \u22641 for at least 21.5 hours will have a \nTTR set to zero. \n\u25cf \nThe AUE for Individual symptoms (adults only) will be calculated from \nbaseline (symptom score prior to start of study drug) to the time at which the \nindividual symptom is first alleviated (\u22641). The AUE of the individual symptom \nscore is calculated for each subject using the trapezoidal rule. \n\u25cf \nTime to resolution of fever is defined as the time from treatment initiation to \nthe last time at which temperature was \u226537.8o C (all patients). For patients \nwho did not have a temperature \u226537.8oC at baseline and throughout the \ndosing period, the time to resolution of fever will be missing. For patients who \nhad a temperature of \u226537.8oC at baseline, followed immediately by a \ntemperature of <37.8o C at their first post-baseline assessment, the time to \nresolution of fever will be zero. Patients who still had a temperature \u226537.8o C \nat the end of the follow-up period will be censored at that time point. Patients \nwho withdraw prior to resolution of fever will be censored at the time of \nwithdrawal. \nNote: As the introduction of the electronic diary removed the requirement for the \npatient to record their own baseline temperature, the baseline for these \npatients will be defined as the temperature recording collected at the first site \nvisit. It is recognized that the absence of a true patient recorded temperature, \nusing the same thermometer and body site, will limit interpretation of this \nendpoint.  \n \n2.2.2.2 \nViral load \nViral load is the number of viral particles per mL of blood. It is reported in log10 \nscale and expressed in 1) virus particles/mL (log10 vp/mL) calculated from the \nquantitative RT-PCR assay (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) \nand 2) 50% tissue culture infectious dose (log10 TCID50) obtained after viral \nculture. \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n9 \n\u25cf \nViral load change from baseline over time expressed in log10 vp/mL, where \nbaseline is defined as the pre-dose day 1 result. \n\u25cf \nViral load change from baseline over time expressed in log10 TCID50/mL, \nwhere baseline is defined as pre-dose day 1 result. Log10 TCID50/mL is \ncalculated as: \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4750 = \u2212\ufffd\ud835\udc4b0 \u2212\ud835\udc512\n\ufffd+ \ud835\udc51\u2211\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d=1\n\ufffd, (Ramakrishnan MA, 2016) \nwhere: \nX0 = positive logarithm of the highest dilution at which all quadruplicate \nwells are positive in the haemagglutination assay or NP-ELISA,  \n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc65=\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65\n4, where rx is the number of positive wells (out of 4) at dilution x, \n xp=1 is maximum dilution at which all 4 wells are positive, \nxmin is the dilution at which all four wells are negative for the first time, \nand \nd is the log10 dilution factor, i.e. log1010-1=-1. \nN.B. The data contains two variables: X0 and X1, where \ud835\udc4b1 =\n\u2212\u2211\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d=1\n and X0=-X0 (see above). Thus, programmatically, \n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4750 = \ud835\udc4b0 \u22120.5 + 0.25\ud835\udc4b1 \n\u25cf \nArea under the viral titer curve calculated applying the trapezoidal rule to the \nlog10 TCID50/mL viral load titer. \n\u25cf \nArea under the viral titer curve calculated applying the trapezoidal rule to the \nlog10 vp/mL viral load titer. \n\u25cf \nPeak viral titer per arm defined as the maximum log10 TCID50/mL. \n\u25cf \nPeak viral titer per arm defined as the maximum log10 vp/mL. \n2.2.2.3 \nViral shedding \nTime to cessation of viral shedding is defined as the time from treatment initiation \nto the time of first negative result with no subsequent positive results. Event is \napplicable only to patients infected at baseline. A value of 0.5 or less log10 \nTCID50/mL and a value of 0.26 or less log10 vp/mL for Flu A strains and 0.3 or \nless log10 vp/mL for Flu B strains will be interpreted as a negative result. Any \nsubsequent missing values for either RT-PCR or culture will be assumed to be \nnegative. Patients who did not have the right assay to determine viral shedding \n(Haemagglutination assay or NP-ELISA) will be excluded from this analysis. \n\u25cf \nTime to cessation of viral shedding determined by Haemagglutination assay \nfor H1N1 and Flu B strains or NP ELISA (NucleoProtein Enzyme-Linked \nImmunosorbent Assay) for H3N2 strains after viral culture and expressed in \nlog10 TCID50/mL (50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose). \n\u25cf \nTime to cessation of viral shedding determined by RT-PCR and expressed in \nlog10 virus particles/mL (vp/mL).  \n\u25cf \nIncidence of patients with viral shedding by RT-PCR by visit. \n\u25cf \nIncidence of patients with viral shedding by viral culture by visit. \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n10 \n\u25cf \nIncidence of persistent shedding, defined as <1 log10 vp/mL reduction at end \nof treatment, compared with baseline. \n2.2.2.4 \nSecondary illness \nNote that although the secondary illnesses of interest defined in the protocol do not \ninclude the term LRTC this term will be included to ensure other LRTCs not captured as \npneumonia or bronchitis will be reported. \n\u25cf \nIncidence of any secondary illnesses such as LRTC (otitis media, bronchitis, \npneumonia or sinusitis) for all patients at any time during the study. \n\u25cf \nIncidence of secondary illnesses, i.e. LRTC, for all patients at any time during \nthe study that are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic use for secondary \nillnesses will be selected from the concomitant logs prior to database lock. \nThis selection will be based on a medical decision. Cases will be identified as \nany antibiotic treatment received for the above secondary illnesses.  \n\u25cf \nTime to initiation of treatment with antibiotics from randomisation. \nNote:  Although this endpoint was defined in the protocol using randomization \ndate and time as the start of the time period, the time from treatment \ninitiation will be used to define the start of the time period.  This decision \nhas been made in order to remain consistent with other time to endpoints in \nthis study. The time between randomization and treatment initiation will be \nchecked to ensure time differences across the two treatment groups are \nbalanced.  \n2.2.2.5 \nHospitalisation \n\u25cf \nIncidence of hospitalisations for all patients. Given that patients will be in the \nstudy for a short period, i.e. ~40 days, we envisage a maximum of 1 \nhospitalisation per patient. Thus, probabilities of hospitalisation will be \ncompared across treatment arms. \n\u25cf \nDuration of hospitalisation (in days), for those who are hospitalized, as \nrecorded directly on the Case Report Form (CRF) for all patients. Given that \nthere may be few hospitalisations, this subgroup analysis will only report \nmedian times and ranges by treatment arm. \n \n2.2.3 \nExploratory Efficacy Outcome Measures \nNot applicable. \n2.2.4 \nPharmacokinetic Outcome Measures \nIf estimable, the following model-predicted PK parameters for oseltamivir and \noseltamivir carboxylate will be calculated on the basis of the oseltamivir \nestablished population PK model. \n\u25cf \nSteady-state area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours \n(AUC0-12). \n\u25cf \nMaximum plasma concentration Cmax. \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n11 \n\u25cf \nTrough plasma concentration Ctrough. \nIf appropriate, the following model-predicted parameters may also be included. \n\u25cf \nElimination half-life (t1/2). \n\u25cf \nTime to maximum concentration (tmax). \n\u25cf \nElimination constant (ke). \n\u25cf \nApparent Clearance (CL/F). \n\u25cf \nApparent volume of distribution (Vc/F). \n\u25cf \nApparent total clearance of metabolite (CLm). \n\u25cf \nLast measurable concentration (Clast). \n\u25cf \nTime to last measurable concentration (tlast). \n \n2.2.5 \nSafety Outcome Measures \nThe endpoints used to support the co-primary objective of safety are the \nfollowing: \n\u25cf \nIncidence and severity of AEs (including influenza-associated complications \nand abnormal findings from physical examinations), SAEs, and reasons for \nthe discontinuation of any study medication. All SAEs and AEs will be \ntabulated including their clinical severity. \n\u25cf \nChange from baseline in vital signs (weight, temperature, respiratory rate, \nblood pressure and pulse rate). \n\u25cf \nChange from baseline in laboratory parameters (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, \nurea, creatinine, CBC and differential blood cell count, i.e. neutrophils, \nlymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils). \n\u25cf \nLab abnormalities by baseline and visit status (see SOP COG 3007 for \nexpected normal ranges). \n\u25cf \nIncidence of tissue rejection or GVHD (Graft Versus Host Disease) in \ntransplant patients. \nNote:  Incidence of transplant rejection or GVHD in transplant patients has been \ndefined in the protocol as both a primary and secondary endpoint.  It will be \nreported as a primary safety endpoint. \n \n2.2.6 \nResistance Outcome Measures \nThe following endpoint is used to support the co-primary objective of resistance. \nResistance is defined as the presence of oseltamivir resistance in samples \nidentified by sequencing of the neuraminidase (NA) and haemagglutinin (HA) \ngenes (genotypic resistance) or by oseltamivir IC50 determination by a NA \ninhibition assay, using statistical outlier rules (phenotypic resistance). \nResistance (genotypic, phenotypic and pooled) will be summarized per age \n(adults, paediatrics), dose group, viral type and subtype.  \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n12 \nFor patients who are infected with both A and B virus types or two Flu A viruses \nthe following algorithm will be applied: \n\u25cf \"A\" if RT-PCR A is positive (i.e. not NEGATIVE) and RT-PCR B is \nNEGATIVE at the 1st timepoint with RT-PCR results. \n\u25cf \"B\" if RT-PCR B is positive (i.e. not NEGATIVE) and RT-PCR A is \nNEGATIVE at the 1st timepoint with RT-PCR results. \n\u25cf  \u201cAB\u201d if RT-PCR A and RT-PCR B are positive (i.e. not NEGATIVE) and \nMixed Flu A if both RT-PCRs for Flu A subtyping are positive (i.e. not \nNEGATIVE) at the 1st time point with RT-PCR results. \n\u25cf  \"UNK\" otherwise. \nFor patients with a mixed infection, samples from time points with only one \ndetected Flu type will be included in the overall virology analyses. Entire virology \ndata will be described separately per patient. \n \n2.2.6.1 \nGenotypic resistance \nBaseline and post-baseline genotypic resistance is defined as the presence \nof oseltamivir resistance mutations in the NA or HA genes identified by \nsequencing of influenza viruses isolated from nasopharyngeal samples. \nGenotypic resistance calculation: Presence of genotypic resistance (yes/no), \ntogether with the specific resistance mutations will be identified (see USPI list in \nAppendix 6) for each nasopharyngeal sample and will be listed.  \nNote: a H274Y-specific RT-PCR assay was performed for some H1N1 \nsamples of season 2008-2009 to determine baseline genotypic resistance \nand results will be also included. \n2.2.6.2 \nPhenotypic Resistance \nBaseline and post-baseline phenotypic resistance is defined as the presence \nof phenotypic resistance identified by oseltamivir IC50 determination, using \nstatistical outlier rules and in accordance with the algorithm described in \nsurveillance studies (Sheu TG et al 2008, Okomo-Adhiambo M et al, 2010). \nPhenotypic resistance calculation: The mean IC50 of the baseline (pre dose \nDay 1 result) samples of all patients will be calculated separately for each virus \nsubtype. Extreme outliers will be defined as any baseline or post-baseline IC50 \nvalues > 10-fold the baseline mean IC50. The baseline IC50 distribution statistics \n(i.e. mean, standard deviation [SD], median, 75th percentile [X0.75]) will then be re-\ncalculated excluding any baseline extreme outliers previously identified. Outliers \nwill be defined as any baseline or post-baseline IC50 values less than 10-fold the \nbaseline mean, but more than three interquartile ranges (IQRs) greater than the \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n13 \nbaseline third quartile (X0.75) ( > [X0.75 + {3 \u00d7 IQR}]). Outliers and extreme outliers \nwill be considered to have phenotypic resistance. \nNote: the phenotypic resistance algorithm assumes that the IC50 samples \nare normally distributed. Appropriate transformations will be considered if \nthis assumption is not met. Furthermore, alternative algorithms (e.g., \nfold-changes, pooling of NA subtypes) may be used if the number of IC50 \nsamples per NA subtype is considered small. \n \n2.3 \nDETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE \nThe sample size has been chosen to provide an adequate number of patients to \nestimate the development of resistance (genotypic and/or phenotypic) with \nreasonable precision.  Assuming that 90% of enrolled patients will have \nlaboratory-confirmed influenza, there will be 75 patients in each treatment arm in \nthe population evaluable for the development of resistance.  The following table \nshows the 95% Pearson-Clopper confidence intervals that would result with a \nsample size of 75 patients in a treatment arm if certain event rates are observed \nin the study. \nTable 1 \nExpected confidence intervals associated to specific event rates  \nObserved Rate (%) \n95% Confidence Interval \n0.0 \n0.0-4.8 \n1.3 \n0.0-7.2 \n2.7 \n0.3-9.3 \n5.3 \n1.5-13.1 \n10.7 \n4.7-19.9 \n \nA total of 83 patients will be enrolled per arm and will be evaluable for the \nassessment of safety.  This number of patients would provide estimates of \nadverse event rates with similar precision (see Table 1). \nThe sample size of 75 patients per group will have 66% power to detect a \nclinically relevant difference (CRD) between active treatment and historical \nplacebo of 34 hours in time to resolution of symptoms, assuming a common \nstandard deviation (SD) of 98 hours, using a 2-sided 10% alpha. The CRD and \nSD reflect those used to power the original study (original protocol).This has \nbeen calculated in EAST version 6.0, based on a Wilcoxon sign rank test. As no \nformal hypothesis will be tested in this study, the use of a 2-sided 10% alpha will \nbe reflected by the use of 90% CIs.  \n2.4 \nANALYSIS TIMING \nThe efficacy and safety data will be reported at the end of the study, following \ndatabase lock.  Database lock will occur once the final SAP has been approved \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n14 \nand the database is clean. The analysis population datasets will then be created \nand reviewed prior to release of Treatment Allocation Information (TAI).  \n3. \nSTUDY CONDUCT \n3.1 \nRANDOMIZATION  \nPatients will be randomized 1:1 to conventional oseltamivir or double dose \noseltamivir, stratified according to 4 binary stratification factors. Patients \nrandomized under Protocol versions A and B will be stratified according to \ntransplant (SOT vs. HSCT); time between onset of influenza symptoms and \ntreatment start (\u226424 hours vs. >24 hours); influenza vaccination status for current \ninfluenza season (yes vs. no), and age (\u226412 years vs. >12 years). \nPatients randomized under Protocol C onwards will be stratified according to \ntransplant (yes vs. no), time between onset of influenza symptoms and treatment \nstart (up to 96 hours, \u226448 hours, >48 hours), influenza vaccination status for \ncurrent influenza season (yes vs. no) and by age (\u226412 years vs. >12 years). As \nonly transplant patients were enrolled during Protocol A and B, at this time, the \nrandomization was not stratified by transplant status. \nThe master randomization list is an un-stratified randomization list implemented \nin the Interactive Voice/Web Recognition System (IxRS) using a dynamic block \nallocation algorithm to centrally assign patients to the correct strata. \nFollowing the release of TAI, the treatment assignments from the IxRS listing will \nbe checked against the master randomization list to ensure the correct \ntreatments have been assigned.  Furthermore, the date and time of \nrandomization will be checked against the date and time of first dose to ensure \npatients were randomized prior to receiving treatment.  Any errors noted will be \nlisted as protocol deviations in the clinical study report (CSR). \nAny patients who were assigned to the incorrect strata level at randomization will \nhave the strata information corrected for reporting purposes but the original \nrandomization will remain unaltered. \n3.2 \nINDEPENDENT REVIEW FACILITY \nNot applicable. \n3.3 \nDATA MONITORING \nBlinded reviews of the data will be performed on an ongoing basis by the study \nscientist. \n4. \nSTATISTICAL METHODS \nAll analyses, summaries and listings will be performed using SAS\u00ae software \n(version 9.2 or higher) in a UNIX environment. The data will be listed in the CSR.  \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n15 \nAll endpoints previously defined will be listed and summarized using appropriate \ndescriptive statistics. \n4.1 \nANALYSIS POPULATIONS \nThe main analysis populations are defined below. \n4.1.1 \nIntent To Treat (ITT) Population \nAll patients randomized will be included in the ITT population. Patients will be \nsummarized under the treatment to which they were randomized. This population \nmay be used to summarize efficacy endpoints for the purpose of sensitivity \nanalyses. This population will generate the most conservative effect estimates \nbecause there may be allocation errors, non-infected patients and/or non-\nadherence to treatment. \n4.1.2 \nIntent To Treat infected (ITTi) Population \nAll patients randomized and with central laboratory confirmation of influenza \ninfection, excluding patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza at \nbaseline, will be included in the ITTi population.  \n4.1.3 \nModified Intent To Treat infected (mITTi) Population \nAll patients randomized to a particular treatment, regardless of whether they \nreceived that treatment or not, and received at least one dose of study drug and \nwith central laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, excluding patients \ninfected with oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline, will be included in the \nmITTi population. This population will also be used to summarize all efficacy and \nresistance endpoints because it will render least biased effect estimates. This \npopulation was not defined in the protocol. \nThe definition of oseltamivir-resistant influenza at baseline is defined in Section \n2.2.6.  Decisions on patient exclusion from the ITT, ITTi and mITTi population \nsets will be made by the statistician and study scientist after database closure.  \nExcluded patients will be documented along with the reason for exclusion.  \n4.1.4 \nPharmacokinetic-Evaluable Patient Population \nThe Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Patient (PKEP) population comprises all patients \nin the ITT population have at least one post-dose drug concentration \nmeasurement at a scheduled visit time point.  Patients may be excluded from the \nPKEP population if they significantly violate the inclusion or exclusion criteria, \ndeviate significantly from the protocol, or have unavailable or incomplete data \nthat may influence the PK analysis. \nDecisions on patient exclusion from the PKEP will be made prior to database \nclosure by the clinical pharmacologist based on information supplied by the Data \nacquisition specialist (whether patients in the ITT population have at least one \npost-dose drug concentration measurement at a scheduled visit time point). No \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n16 \nPK data will be shared with the team as this would unblind the study.  Excluded \npatients will be documented along with the reason for exclusion. \n4.1.5 \nSafety Population \nThe safety analysis population will include all patients who receive at least one \ndose of study drug and have had a safety assessment performed post \nrandomization.  All safety variables will be summarized and presented in tables \nbased on this safety population.  Any patients who receive a dose that differs \nfrom the dose to which they were randomized will be reported under their actual \ntreatment. \n4.1.6 \nProtocol Deviations \nMajor protocol deviations will be listed in the CSR. Major protocol deviations will \ninclude those captured during the study conduct (\n file), as well as any \nadditional deviations found as a result of programmatic checks of the following \ncriteria: \n- Patients who received their first study drug dose more than 96 hours from onset \nof symptoms. \n- Patients with randomization errors \u2013 randomized and not dosed, dosed prior to \nrandomization. \n- Use of antiviral treatment for influenza in the 2 weeks prior to randomization \nand during the 10 day treatment phase of the study. \n- Less than 16 of the 20 planned doses (80%) of study drug. \nSensitivity analyses may be carried out excluding any major protocol deviations.  \n4.2 \nANALYSIS OF STUDY CONDUCT \nThe following tables will be summarized by treatment group according to current \nsponsor data standards. \n\u25cf \nSummary of treatment.   \n\u25cf \nSummary of disposition of patients in the Safety, ITT, ITTi, mITTi and PKEP \npopulations. \n\u25cf \nSummary of patients excluded and reasons for exclusions from each of the \nanalysis populations (Safety, ITT, PKEP, ITTi, mITTi). \n\u25cf \nSummary of withdrawals, including the reason for withdrawal (Safety, ITT, \nITTi, mITTi). \n\u25cf \nSummary of concomitant medications split by: immunosuppressive \ntreatment; treatment for influenza-like symptoms; treatment for AEs; other \ntreatments. \nProtocol deviations, as reported directly by sites or captured through \nprogrammatic checks of the database of deviations that occur during study \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n17 \nconduct, will be listed and summarized by randomized treatment accordingly, as \nper Section 4.1.6.  \n \n4.3 \nANALYSIS OF TREATMENT GROUP COMPARABILITY \nBaseline patient characteristics will be summarized by treatment group.  The \nmain population for these baseline summaries will be the mITTi.  However, \nsummaries based on the Safety, ITT and ITTi populations will also be included in \nthe CSR.   \nAll baseline patient characteristics data will be listed.  To assess comparability, \ndescriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group as follows: \n\u25cf \nDemography including age, gender, race and ethnicity. \n\u25cf \nImmunodeficiency conditions at baseline. \n\u25cf \nTransplant history. \n\u25cf \nHistorical CD4 count. \n\u25cf \nInfluenza vaccination status. \n\u25cf \nPrevious or current diseases at baseline (Medical History). \n\u25cf \nPrevious treatments, split by immunosuppressive treatment, treatment for \ninfluenza-like symptoms, and others.  \n\u25cf \nInfluenza infection status: Flu Type (A or B) and Flu A subtype (H1N1, H3N2) \n(mITTi only). \nNo statistical comparisons will be made, as no formal hypothesis is being tested. \n4.4 \nEFFICACY ANALYSIS \nAll efficacy endpoints are considered secondary or exploratory. As no formal \nefficacy hypothesis is being tested, treatment differences presented in any \nefficacy analyses will be reported with associated confidence intervals (CIs) only. \nEfficacy endpoints will be summarized by age group. All summaries and \nanalyses are described below and listed in Appendix 5. All efficacy analyses will \nbe based on the mITTi and ITTi populations. ITT will be presented for the main \nefficacy TTR summary tables (all symptoms and temperature only) to investigate \nthe effect of treatment in a \u201creal world\u201d scenario, i.e. unknown infection status \nand/or adherence. N.B. Regulatory bodies have asked for these outputs in \npivotal studies. \nAll efficacy summaries and analyses will be carried out separately for adults \n(patients \u2265 18 years) and paediatrics (patients <13 years old). Adolescent data \n(patients aged between \u226513 and <18 years old) will be listed as appropriate. \nAs the symptom data are recorded on patient diaries, data errors cannot be \nqueried.  Obvious data errors, i.e. temperature 100oC, will be excluded and \ndocumented. For duplicated data, the worst evaluation will be used to obtain \nconservative estimates. \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n18 \nThe endpoints as described in the protocol have been expanded to give sufficient \ninformation of the derivations required, e.g. symptom scores was the endpoint \ndefined in the protocol but Time To Resolution of symptom scores is how it is \ndescribed in the SAP. \n4.4.1 \nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint \nNot applicable. \n4.4.2 \nSecondary Efficacy Endpoints \n4.4.2.1 \nTime to Event Endpoints \nTime to event endpoints include the following: TTR of all symptoms, TTR of \nindividual symptoms, time to cessation of viral shedding and time to resolution of \nfever. These endpoints will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier tables and \ngraphs. Viral shedding will be studied also per virus strain. The median TTR and \nassociated 95% CIs will be estimated for each of the two treatment groups. The \nexact CIs of the median differences of Hodges-Lehmann (HL) estimators will be \nderived using the PROC NPAR1WAY in SAS. The protocol mentioned \nbootstrapping, however in SAS, bootstrapping calculates differences between \nmedians, when the correct estimator in skewed distributions is the median of \ndifferences (or HL estimator). Asymptotic theory exists to obtain those CI (aka \nMoses CI). \nPatients who have not experienced the event, e.g. resolution of all symptoms, by \nthe last day of contact will be censored at this time. Patients who withdraw from \nthe study without experiencing the event will be censored at the time of \nwithdrawal (see Appendix 7). \n4.4.2.2 \nComparison of TTR of All Symptoms to Historical Control \nIt is unethical to treat IC patients with placebo. Nevertheless, it is important to \nascertain whether treating IC patients for influenza is still better than not treating \nthem. Given the ethical constraint, the next best possible comparison available is \nagainst historical placebo controls. Thus, any difference between these two \ngroups will be due to both IC status (yes/no) and oseltamivir effect. It will not be \npossible to differentiate both effects statistically. Historical controls will come first \nand foremost from pivotal historical oseltamivir studies where otherwise healthy \n(OwH) were enrolled. The main comparison of active treatment with historical \ncontrol placebo will be based on a 1:1 matching of all adult NV20234 patients \nwith OwH placebo patients from the pivotal studies. All patients in the adult mITTi \npopulation will be matched to historical patients (from the pivotal studies) that \nreceived a placebo.  \nThere are three types of matches in order of priority: \n1. Patients will be matched 1:1 within viral strain and then by age with \u00b1 5 \nyears caliper (the lowest limit being 18) and gender. Any remaining \nunmatched individual will be matched by age and gender alone. Only \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n19 \npivotal studies will be used. Outputs in appendix 5 refer to this matching \nrule. \n2. Patients will be strictly matched 1:1 by age as above, gender and \ninfluenza strain. Only pivotal studies will be used. There will probably \nleave more unmatched patients but those matched will be more similar \nthan in 1. \n3. Patients will be matched 1:>1 as in 1 above using pivotal and non-pivotal \nbut relevant historical studies. Additional matching by time between \nsymptoms onset and first treatment (possibly with a caliper) will be used if \ncloser matching is required. This is a sensitivity analysis captured in \nsection 4.4.4. \nIn cases where those matching rules are not sufficient, i.e. more than one patient \nin the 1:1 placebo matching, an additional rule will be the elapsed time from first \nsymptoms to first dose. If several matches are still available in the 1:1 ratio, one \nmatch will be chosen at random (the seed of the random number generator will \nbe kept for reproducibility). \nAny patient from study NV20234 who has not been matched will not be included \nin these analyses. Matches will be done independently for historical placebo and \nhistorical treated. Modifications of the matching rules above may be permitted if \nscientifically required, e.g. matching by time in 3 above requires a window. The \nITTi population in historical studies is equivalent to the current mITTi population. \nThe pivotal studies to be used are: WV15671 (18-65y, OwH, USA, placebo-\nconventional-double) and WV15670 (18-65y, OwH, Europe, Canada, Hong-\nKong, placebo-conventional-double). Potential additional studies include: \nWV15730 (18-65y, OwH), M76001 (13-80y, OwH, placebo-conventional) and \nWV15758 (1-12y, OwH, placebo-conventional). \nA similar comparison may be done between current IC patients and historical \npatients defined as at risk. There may be a 1:1 and 1:>1 matching ratios. The \nhistorical studies with patients at risk include WV15812 (\u226513y, placebo-\nconventional) and WV15872 (\u226512y, placebo-conventional). Additional studies in \nelderly (>65 years of age) are: WV15819, WV15876, WV15978 and WV15707 \n(see Appendix 4). \nThe following median differences in TTR of all symptoms (90% and 95% CIs) will \nbe reported: \n1. Comparison of conventional dose with matched placebo. \n2. Comparison of double dose with matched placebo. \n3. Comparison of combined conventional and double dose with combined \nmatched historical placebo (if the results of the NV20234 dose group \ncomparisons suggest responses are similar). \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n20 \nTo aid interpretation of the results, the median TTR of all symptoms and \nassociated 90% CIs will be plotted against historical placebo responses for a) \nNV20234 conventional dose b) NV20234 double dose c) NV20234 combined \ndose groups.  \nIn addition to the comparison of NV20234 active with placebo patients from the \npivotal studies, a treatment historical control dataset will be created from the \nsame adult treatment studies, matching NV20234 patients randomized to the \nconventional dosing arm with the conventional dose from the adult treatment \nstudies. This will enable an informal comparison of the treatment response of IC \npatients with the treatment response in otherwise healthy patients. Patients will \nbe matched using the same rules as those for historical control. \nThe full specifications for historical control groups can be found in Appendix 4. \nThe final set of historical placebo patients will be confirmed prior to treatment \nunblinding and database lock. \n \n4.4.2.3 \nContinuous Endpoints \nContinuous endpoints will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive \nstatistics N, mean (geometric mean where appropriate), SD, median, and range.  \nThis will apply to: duration of hospitalisation; absolute and change from baseline \nover time in log10 viral load from quantitative RT-PCR (vp/mL), log10 viral load \ntiter from culture (log10 TCID50/mL), AUC viral load titer, peak viral load titer, AUE \ntotal symptom score, and AUE individual symptom scores. \n4.4.2.4 \nBinary Endpoints (Incidences) \nThe proportion of patients experiencing the event will be presented for each of \nthe two treatment groups. This will apply to the patients still shedding virus per \nplanned visit, all secondary illnesses endpoints, and hospitalisations (for viral \nshedding it will be presented by treatment group, age cohort and flu type). \n\u25cf \nIncidence of any secondary illnesses: each patient can have several LRTCs, \ntherefore a table of frequencies of 0 to 4 LRTC will be obtained per treatment \narm. \n\u25cf \nIncidence of secondary illnesses for patients treated with antibiotics: as \nabove, the frequency of LRTC will be obtained by treatment arm. \n\u25cf \nIncidence of initiation of treatment with antibiotics: The probability of antibiotic \nuse will be compared between treatment arms using probability differences \nand confidence intervals of those differences. \n\u25cf \nIncidence of hospitalisations: probabilities of hospitalisation per treatment \narm and their CI\u2019s will be provided. \n\u25cf \nDuration of hospitalisation: given that there may be few hospitalisations, this \nsubgroup analysis will only report median times and ranges by treatment \narm. \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n21 \n4.4.3 \nExploratory Efficacy Endpoints \nDescriptive statistics may be used to further investigate symptom scoring in \nadults and children considering that symptoms of the patient\u2019s underlying \nimmune status and baseline conditions could overlap with influenza-like illness \nsymptoms in this patient population. \n4.4.4 \nSensitivity Analyses \n4.4.4.1 \nEfficacy Analyses using ITTi  \nAll analyses relating to TTR of all symptoms and TTR of individual symptoms, \ndescribed in Section 4.4.2.1, will be repeated using the ITTi population.  \n \n \n4.4.4.2 \nEfficacy Analyses excluding other antiviral patient data \nThe TTR (mITTi) of all symptoms analyses described in Section 4.4.2.1 will be \nrerun excluding any follow-up data collected from those patients who began \ntreatment with another antiviral for influenza, on or after discontinuation of study \ndrug. Note that although Section 8.2.7.1 of the protocol indicates that such \nexclusions should be made for all efficacy analyses, this statement contradicts \nthe definition of the ITT, ITTi and mITTi populations, so the exclusions of antiviral \npatient data will be regarded as a sensitivity analysis rather than the main \nanalysis. Non-immunocompromised patients will be excluded.  \n4.4.4.3 \nAdditional efficacy analyses using alternative historical \ncontrols \nFurther sensitivity analyses of TTR of all symptoms may be carried out using \nalternative historical control datasets as follows: \n1. 1: >1 mapping with OwH patients.  \n2. 1: >1 mapping with At Risk patients. \nThe purpose of the alternative historical control datasets is two-fold:  \n1) Increase the precision on the historical median response by increasing the \nnumber of patients contributing to this sample using a 1 :> 1 mapping \napproach.  \n2) Provide a range of placebo responses that may be considered plausible \nsurrogate responses for an IC untreated population. This is based on the \nevidence of an observed difference in placebo responses for otherwise \nhealthy patients compared with at risk and elderly patients in the \noseltamivir adult treatment database. \nTo allow for potential exploratory analyses of other efficacy endpoints, the \nhistorical control dataset will also include the patient level variables where readily \navailable: baseline creatinine clearance, age, gender, virus type and subtype, \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n22 \ntime to cessation of viral shedding, AUE of symptom scores, AUC of viral titer, \ntime to resolution of individual symptoms. \n4.4.4.4 \nComparison of TTR of All Symptoms to Historical Control  \nThe following Kaplan-Meier analyses will be carried out using the mITTi \npopulation to support the comparison of Study NV20234 treatment response with \nthe historical placebo response with both 1:1 and 1:>1 ratios: \n\u25cf \nThe TTR of all symptoms for adults using only follow-up symptom data \nrecorded up to and including 25 days compared with historical placebo data. \nThis is to investigate the impact of differences in the follow-up observation \nperiods between study NV20234 and the oseltamivir treatment database. \nAdult patients in Study NV20234 who have not experienced resolution of \nsymptoms by day 25 will be censored on day 25. In the historical studies \n(see section 4.4.2.2 above and appendix 4) the final assessment was \nbetween days 17 and 25 post onset. A sensitivity analysis will be carried out \ncomparing results from the previous analyses against an analysis without \ncensoring at 25 days, i.e. using the current final assessment ~40 days after \nonset of symptoms.  \n\u25cf \nThe TTR of all symptoms for patients who had symptoms onset \u226448 \nhours before first dose, for each active treatment group and combined, \ncompared with matched historical control patients. \n4.4.4.5 \nAdditional Secondary Illnesses Analysis \nThe incidence of specified secondary illnesses summaries will be repeated, sub-\nsetting on any LRTC starting on or after study day 3 or at least 48 hours after first \nstudy drug intake and treated with antibiotics. This should exclude pre-existing \nsecondary illnesses that may not be linked to the treatment. These incidences \nwill be repeated for LRTCs regardless of antibiotic use. Antibiotic use for \nsecondary illnesses will be selected from the concomitant medications log prior \nto database lock. These will be identified as antibiotic treatment received for the \nabove secondary illnesses. \n4.4.5 \nSubgroup Analyses \nTo check for comparability of treatment groups across the stratification levels \nused to randomize the study, the TTR of All Symptoms in the mITTi population \nwill be summarized by treatment group split by:  \n\u25cf \nVaccination status (yes vs. no). \n\u25cf \nTransplant status (yes vs. no). \n\u25cf \nTime from symptom onset to time of first dose (\u2264 48 hours vs. > 48 hours). \n\u25cf \nAge (\u226412 vs. >12 years). \nThe stratification by Transplant status was added in Protocol version C. \nA further subgroup analysis of TTR of All Symptoms (mITTi) will be carried out by \ngeographical location. The 5 regions will be North America (USA and Mexico), \nSouth America (Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala), Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n23 \nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine), Western Europe \n(Belgium, Italy, Spain and Israel) and South Africa. A single Kaplan-Meier \nanalysis will be done by geographic region. \n4.4.6 \n Additional analyses not specified in the protocol \nTwo additional analyses for efficacy (TTR and temperature) that were not in the \noriginal protocol have been introduced in the SAP. \n \n4.4.6.1 \nUse of 90% Cis \nIn addition to 95% CI, 90% CI will be also shown when comparing current data \nagainst historical controls. This was agreed jointly by PDCO, CHMP and Roche \nin a briefing document dated \n where the possibility of establishing a \nnew dose recommendation/regimen was discussed. \n \n4.4.6.2 \nRemoval of >48 hour symptom onset to dose restriction \nAlthough the protocol originally specified this comparison would be restricted to \nthose patients who received treatment within 48 hours (\u226448 hours), such analysis \nwill be conducted as a sensitivity analysis only. The rationale for the additional \nanalyses is that there is no direct evidence that dosing more than 48 hours after \nthe start of symptoms will not be effective. Whilst evidence from a large \nobservational study suggests an increased benefit for patients if dosed within 48 \nhours, compared with patients dosed after 48 hours, there is still evidence of \nbenefit if dosed more than 48 hours after symptom onset. In addition, IC patients \ncan have prolonged viral shedding compared to immune-competent patients, \nsuggesting that administration of drug after 96 hours after symptom onset may \nstill provide benefit to these patients by limiting duration of their influenza.  \n \n4.5 \nPHARMACOKINETIC AND PHARMACODYNAMIC ANALYSES \nIndividual and mean plasma concentrations from the oseltamivir population PK \nmodel at each sampling time-point for oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate will \nbe presented by listings and descriptive summary statistics, including means, \ngeometric means, medians, ranges, standard deviations and coefficients of \nvariation. Individual and mean concentration-versus-time profiles will be plotted \non linear and semi-logarithmic scales. \nPlasma concentration data from sparse sampling will be analysed by the clinical \npharmacologist using an established population PK model to determine key \nexposure parameters defined in Section 2.2.4.  Note:  For IC children (\u2264 12 \nyears) and adolescents (> 12 - \u2264 17 years), plasma oseltamivir and oseltamivir \ncarboxylate concentrations will be modeled in NONMEM using a structure similar \nto a comprehensive population PK model which was previously developed using \noseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate plasma concentration data from non-IC \nchildren and adults (ages 1 to 80 years). \nThe PK parameters will be listed and summarized by treatment group using \ndescriptive summary statistics including means, geometric means, medians, \nranges, standard deviations and coefficients of variation. \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F.

Different symbols will be used to differentiate treatment \ngroups. \nAll listings and summaries of plasma concentrations and estimable PK \nparameters will be based on the PKEP population. \nFurther PK and PK/PD analyses may be carried out by the clinical pharmacology \ngroup. This will be reported in a separate report when appropriate. \n4.6 \nSAFETY ANALYSES \nNo formal hypothesis is being tested to support the co-primary objective of \nsafety. Therefore, there will be no formal statistical comparisons between the two \ntreatment groups. Summaries will be based on the Safety Population and will be \nprovided by treatment and split by age: adults (\u226518 years) vs. pool of adolescents \nand children (<18 years). Only tables for adverse event (AE) and serious adverse \nevent (SAE) [summary and incidence by System Organ Class (SOC) and \nPreferred Term (PT)] will be provided separately for adolescents (\u226513 to <18 \nyears) and children (<13 years). \nAll continuous safety outcomes will be given as medians or medians and 95% \nconfidence intervals per treatment arm.

All AEs \nreported on treatment will be considered to be treatment emergent.  \n4.6.3 \nLaboratory Data \nBlood samples for planned central laboratory tests for safety evaluation of clinical \nchemistry and haematology are collected at baseline (pre-dose Day 1) and Day \n11/End of Treatment.  Results will be listed and summarized for the Safety \nPopulation, Adults (\u2265 18 years) separately from adolescents and children (\u226417 \nyears).

If a test was repeated on the same day, the average result will \nbe used in the summary tables. If the scheduled Day 11 laboratory test \nwas taken after the end of treatment, these off treatment results will still be \npresented in the summaries.  \nHistorical and Day 1 (Protocol versions A and B only) creatinine clearance, CD4 \ncounts and white blood cell (WBC) counts will be listed, where available.  CD4 \ncounts will be summarized separately using descriptive summaries for patients \nonly with the inclusion criteria \u201cHIV with a most recent CD4 count <500/mm3 (or \n<25% in children \u2264 5years old) within the last 6 months and, in the investigator\u2019s \nopinion, considered immunocompromised\u201d. \n4.6.4 \nVital Signs \nVital sign measurements including weight, temperature, respiratory rate, blood \npressure (position not specified) and pulse rate are planned on Days 1, 2 or 3, 6, \n8 and Days 11, 15 and 40.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \n \nObjectives \nPrimary \nTo evaluate prospectively the safety and tolerability of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza \nin IC patients under standard and double dose, and characterize the effects of oseltamivir in IC \npatients on the development of resistant influenza virus (see 4.6). \nSecondary \nTo evaluate the effects of conventional and double dose oseltamivir in IC patients on: \n\u25cf The population pharmacokinetics of both oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in IC \npatients with confirmed influenza infection, through the application of established population \npharmacokinetic (PK) models to the sparse plasma concentration data generated. \n\u25cf The virologic course of influenza (proportion shedding and viral loads at different \ntimepoints) \n\u25cf The time to resolution of influenza symptoms \n\u25cf The clinical course of influenza (fever, symptoms, secondary illnesses as evidenced by \notitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinusitis)  \n\u25cf To explore the relationship of metrics of exposure (e.g., AUC, Cmin) to relevant \npharmacodynamic  endpoints \n \nStudy Design \nDescription of Study \nThis is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center trial of twice daily, conventional and double \ndose oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in IC patients.  Patients will be stratified by age \n(<13 vs. >12 years), transplant status (yes vs. no), time since onset of flu symptoms and \ntreatment start (up to 96 hours) (\u2264 48 vs. >48 hours) and vaccination status (yes vs. no). \nNumber of Patients \nA minimum of 166 (83 per arm) to allow an adequate number of influenza A patients per arm; \nincluding 50 transplant recipients and at least 15 paediatric patients.   \nNumber of Centers \nApproximately 125 centers in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres \nOseltamivir (Tamiflu)\u2014F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd \nStatistical Analysis Plan NV20234 \n29 \nTarget Population \nPatients immunocompromised due to a primary or secondary immunodeficiency, 1 year of age \nand older (the paediatric and adolescent patients will be defined as 1 year to less than 18 years of age).  \nThe patients will be positive for influenza by a rapid diagnostic test, PCR or viral culture at \nbaseline. \nLength of Study \nThe study comprises 10 days of treatment with follow up visits approximately 5 and 30 days \nlater as shown in the schedule of assessments.  Study medication will be administered twice \ndaily over 10 days for a total of 20 doses.  A rapid diagnostic test for influenza will be performed \nat the end of the 10 days of treatment.  Patients still having influenza based on the rapid \ndiagnostic test will be treated per the local standard of care by the principal investigator, and \nany medication provided during the follow-up period should be captured in the CRF.   \nProcedures (summary) \nThe key procedures are: \n\u25cf Blood draws for serum chemistry, hematology, serology, and PK assessments (for those \npatients who provide additional consent to participate in the PK assessments). \n\u25cf Nasal and throat swabs for viral culture and RT-PCR. \n \nAssessments of: \nSafety \nThe safety laboratory assessments in this study, including the assessment of serum chemistry \nand hematology will be carried out at a central laboratory.  Serum chemistry assessments \ncomprise AST, ALT, total bilirubin, urea and creatinine.  Hematology assessments include CBC \nand differential count.  The total volume of blood loss for laboratory assessments will be \napproximately 20 mL for the entire duration of the study.  \nProtection of patient confidentiality (Section16) will extend to any data generated from the \nassaying of these samples.  Biological samples taken from all patients may be infectious and \nwill be classified as \u201cdiagnostic specimens\u201d for dispatch purposes. \nWhen clinically indicated, the investigator may draw blood for serum creatinine to be assessed \nat the local laboratory during the study to calculate creatinine clearance \nResistance \nDevelopment of resistance \nEfficacy \nThe efficacy laboratory assessments are used for laboratory confirmation of influenza. These \nare: \nNasal and throat swabs.  Two nasal and one throat swab will be collected as described in the \nSchedule of Assessments.  All swabs are sent to a central laboratory for RT-PCR and viral \ncultures.  Influenza virus shedding will be assessed.   \nAt the end of treatment (Day 11), a rapid diagnostic test is permITTed for the diagnosis of \nongoing influenza. \nInvestigational Medicinal Products \nTest Product: \nOseltamivir/placebo dry powder (to be reconstituted to a concentration of 12 mg/mL or 6 mg/mL \n[the 6 mg/mL will only be used if applicable and not before 2015]) and 75 mg capsules.

Assuming that 90% of enrolled patients \nwill have laboratory-confirmed influenza, there will be 75 patients in each treatment arm in the \npopulation evaluable for the development of resistance.  The following table shows the 95% \nPearson-Clopper confidence intervals that would result with a sample size of 75 patients in a \ntreatment arm if certain event rates are observed in the study. \nDuring the study the number of influenza A virus infected patients and the rate of development \nof resistance will be monitored in a blinded fashion, in order to ensure a reasonable precision \nfor the estimation is maintained.  Additional patients may be enrolled if necessary. \nTable A1.1.

The VAD variables \nwhich denote missing data rules are TESTTYPE AND DATETYPE (refer to the \nefficacy VAD specifications for details).  \nIf symptoms were missing, 0 or 1 at baseline and were subsequently recorded as \nmissing, 0 or 1 for at least 21.5 hours, then the TTA of all symptoms was set to \n",
