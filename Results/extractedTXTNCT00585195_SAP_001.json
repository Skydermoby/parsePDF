INTRODUCTION\nThis document describes the planned statistical analyses for Protocol A8081001 dated \nDecember 5, 2005 and subsequent protocol Amendments #2 - #24 This SAP is meant to \nsupplement the study protocol.  A Supplemental SAP describes any additional analyses \nnot included in this main SAP that are planned for the ALK-positive NSCLC cohort, the \nROS1 marker positive NSCLC patients, and the MET Exon 14 alterations NSCLC \npatients identified in Table 5 of Section 8.2.  Any deviations from this main analysis plan \nor the supplemental analysis plan will be described in the Clinical Study Report.\n2.1. STUDY DESIGN\nStudy A8081001 is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 dose escalation, safety, \npharmacokinetic \n study of PF-02341066 in patients with advanced cancer.  \nThe initial design of the study focused on determining the dose limiting toxicities \n(DLTs), maximum tolerated dose, and recommended dose for Phase 2 studies (RP2D) for \nPF-02341066 administered twice a day (BID).  Assessments of evidence of antitumor \nactivity were also included. \nThe study includes a standard 3 + 3 design 1 for dose escalation component in patients \nwith advanced, solid tumors refractory to standard therapy.  Patients are enrolled in \ncohorts of three patients. The dose escalation component is followed by further \nevaluation of the RP2D in 2 cohorts.  The first RP2D cohort evaluates the potential for \nCYP3A inhibition due to PF-02341066 using midazolam (MDZ) as a probe.  The second \nRP2D cohort is composed of an enriched population and includes molecularly-defined \ngroups of patients who are predicted to have a clinical response to PF-02341066:\n\u2022\nALK-positive NSCLC cohort\nCCI\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 11 of 77\n\uf0b7\nMET amplified NSCLC cohort\n\uf0b7\nROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort\n\uf0b7\nEnriched Other cohort, including NSCLC patients with tumors harboring \nMET Exon 14 alterations (see below)\nIn addition, 2 ALK-negative NSCLC cohorts are evaluated at the RP2D.  A further dose \nescalation cohort was added to evaluate PF-02341066 administered once a day (QD).  \nAlso, 2 drug-drug interaction (DDI) sub-studies were added to assess the effect of the \nco-administration of rifampin, and separately of itraconazole, on the multiple-dose \npharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 BID. \nAlthough patients are enrolled in a single cohort/sub-study, some analyses (eg, analyses \nof ophthalmic data and analyses of hypogonadism data) are based on groups of patients \nwho are drawn from multiple cohort/sub-study enrollments.  Additionally, patients \nenrolled in one cohort may also be analyzed with patients in another cohort based on the \ntumor markers present. \nPatients who enroll in the Enriched Other cohort may well be a very diverse group, \nincluding patients who are positive for ALK chromosomal translocation (except for \npatients with NSCLC) or ALK gene amplification; or positive for known MET kinase \ndomain activating mutations; or having chromosomal translocations/ fusions that lead to \naltered transcriptional regulation of MET and/or HGF; or positive for chromosomal \ntranslocations at the ROS1 gene in other cancer types besides NCSLC; or NSCLC \npatients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations.  In this version of the SAP, \nreferences to handling of data pertaining to the Enriched Other cohort should in general \nbe understood to pertain to appropriately-defined subgroups of the Enriched cohort.  Such \nsubgroups will be defined when there are a sufficient number of patients who can be \nmeaningfully combined based on their tumors and tumor profiles.  At this time only the \nMET Exon 14 alteration subgroup has been identified for specific consideration in the \nEnriched Other cohort.\nNote the aforementioned groups are further defined in Appendix 1.\n2.2. STUDY OBJECTIVES\n1.\nDetermine the safety profile of PF-02341066 including identification of dose \nlimiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\n2.\nDetermine the recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2D) and regimens of \nPF-02341066.\n3.\nDetermine pharmacokinetic profile of PF-02341066 following oral \nadministration including the effect of food.\n4.\nPerform initial evaluation of PF-02341066 related CYP3A4 inhibition using \nmidazolam (MDZ) as a probe.\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 12 of 77\n5.\nDetermine the effect of the co-administration of rifampin on the multiple-dose \nplasma pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066.\n6.\nDetermine the effect of the co-administration of itraconazole on the \nmultiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066.\n \n8.\nDocument any evidence of anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066.\n \n \n10.\nEvaluate the effect of PF-02341066 on parameters related to hypogonadism in \nmales.\n3. INTERIM ANALYSES, FINAL ANALYSES AND UNBLINDING\nThis is an open label, single-arm trial for which no formal interim analysis is planned.  \nThe final analysis will be performed after the last patient last visit; however, earlier \nanalyses of the data may be performed for publication and regulatory reporting purposes.\n4. HYPOTHESIS AND DECISION RULES\nA total of approximately 600 patients will be enrolled in this study including patients in \nthe dose escalation, RP2D, and DDI cohorts (rifampin and itraconazole).\n4.1. DOSE ESCALATION PHASE\nThe number of patients enrolled will depend upon the observed safety profile and study \nobjectives, which will determine the number of patients per dose level, the number of \ndose escalations and the number of cohorts.\nIt is anticipated that approximately 70 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation \nphase of this study to determine both the QD MTD and the BID MTD. \nThe operating characteristics for the dose escalation part of this study design are shown in \nTable 1, which provides the probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each \nunderlying true DLT rate.  For example, for a toxicity that occurs in 5% of patients, there \nis a greater than 95% probability of escalating.  Conversely, for a common toxicity that \noccurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is <5%.\nC\nC\nI\nC\nC\nI\n",

MET-Amplified NSCLC Cohort\nIn order to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with \nMET-amplified NSCLC, patients will be enrolled into one of the following categories:\n\uf0b7\nHigh Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio \u22655.0): as \ndocumented in Amendment # 24 and based on the Protocol Administrative \nClarification Letter (PACL) dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cutoff for \nthis group was revised to \u22654.0.  As per the PACL dated 11 September 2018, this \ngroup was closed to further enrollment. The remaining 14 enrollment slots were \ntransferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations subgroup within the Enriched Other \ncohort.\n\uf0b7\nMedium Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio >2.2 to \n<5.0): as documented in Amendment # 24 and based on the PACL dated 15 May \n2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cutoff for this group was revised to >2.2 to \uf03c4.0; this \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 15 of 77\ngroup was closed to further enrollment.  The remaining 13 enrollment slots were \ntransferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations subgroup within the Enriched Other \ncohort.\n\uf0b7\nLow Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio \u22651.8 to \u22642.2) \nAs documented in Amendment # 22, this category was closed to enrollment as of \nNote to File 12 October 2015; 3 patients had been enrolled at that time.\nFor each category, an ORR of 10% was considered to be uninteresting for further study \nfor this category with 30% considered interesting for further exploration.  Using a Simon \noptimal two-stage design with alpha=0.05 and 80% power, a test of the null hypothesis \nthat p \u2264 10% versus the alternative p \u2265 30% requires 10 evaluable patients in the first \nstage.  If \u2264 1 objective response (CR or PR) is observed in the first 10 patients for any \ncategory, no additional patients in that category will be enrolled.  If 2 or more objective \nresponses are observed in the first stage for any category, the first stage may be expanded \nby enrolling 19 additional patients in that category.  However, upon completion and \nevaluation of the first stage, a decision will be made whether or not to expand to the \nsecond stage in any of the 3 categories investigated.  Within a category, if >5 objectives \nresponses are observed, the null hypothesis will be rejected.\n4.2.1.2. ALK-Negative NSCLC Cohort #1\nThe main objective of this ALK-negative NSCLC cohort was to evaluate the objective \nresponse in this group of patients and to compare with the objective response observed \nfrom ALK-positive NSCLC patients. This objective is now being addressed in the \nALK-negative cohort #2.\nFurther details regarding ALK-negative Cohort #1, including the sample size \ncomputations that were relevant at the time, are presented in the protocol.\n4.2.1.3. ALK-Negative NSCLC Cohort #2\nIn order to further characterize the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in ALK-negative \nNSCLC patients, at least 20 patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  These patients may \nhave been pre-screened by a local ALK test but only those who were determined to have \nALK-negative NSCLC by a central laboratory may be eligible for enrollment.  Initially, \nthe protocol specified that no molecular testing for MET or ROS1 should occur prior to \nenrollment.  As of a Note to File dated 19 June 2012 (at the time only 1 patient had been \nenrolled into this cohort), the requirement that no molecular testing for MET or ROS1 to \noccur prior to enrollment was removed.  Thus, MET or ROS1 testing may have been \nperformed prior to patient entry into this cohort.  However, if the test result for either \nMET or ROS1 was positive, then the patient could not be enrolled into this cohort.\nThe ALK-negative cohort #2 was driven partly by the belief that patients whose tumors \nwere negative by the Investigational Use Only (IUO) test, but positive by the Laboratory \nDeveloped Test (LDT) test, could benefit from PF-02341066 treatment.  Thus, the \nrationale for the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort #2 was to address questions regarding \nactivity in the ALK-negative NSCLC population where patients were \u201cpurely\u201d negative \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 16 of 77\n(ie, if pretesting was done, the local test must be negative and results of the local test \nneeded to be confirmed by the central laboratory before entry into the study). \n4.2.2. RP2D Enriched Other Cohort \nThe RP2D Enriched Other cohort includes all patients in RP2D who do not belong to one \nof the previously defined cohorts.  This enriched population will be used to evaluate the \nanti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with other molecular profiles that confer \nsensitivity to PF-02341066, in particular, patients who are positive for ALK \nchromosomal translocation (except for patients with NSCLC) or ALK gene \namplification; who are positive for known MET kinase domain activating mutations; who \nhave chromosomal translocations/ fusions that lead to altered transcriptional regulation of \nMET and/or HGF; or are positive for chromosomal translocations at the ROS1 gene in \nother cancer types besides NCSLC; or NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET \nExon 14 alterations.  The sample size of the Enriched Other cohort will be dependent \nupon the number of enrolled patients meeting the criteria for this cohort; however it is \nanticipated that approximately 171patients will be enrolled.  RECIST version 1.0 is used \nto assess tumor activity in this cohort. \nIn NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations, an ORR of 10% is \nconsidered to be uninteresting for further study for this group with 30% considered \ninteresting for further exploration.  With 33 evaluable patients, there is at least 90% \npower to test the null hypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 0.10 versus the \nalternative hypothesis that it is greater than 0.10 assuming an alternative target rate of \n0.30 with a one-sided \u03b1=0.05 based on a single stage design using exact test.  The null \nhypothesis will be rejected if \u2265 7 objective responses are observed among the first \n33 evaluable patients.  As of data cutoff date 01 August 2016, 11 confirmed objective \nresponses (CR, PR) were observed in a total of 28 response-evaluable patients with MET \nExon 14-positive NSCLC.  Based on the number of confirmed objective responses \nobserved, the null hypothesis was rejected. The proportion of responders will be \nestimated with better precision if the number of evaluable patients exceeds 33 patients.\n1.\nAs of Amendment 23 (21 February 2017), the sample size in the Enriched Other \ncohort was further increased to a total of 130 patients, including approximately \n50 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  In addition, a separate subgroup of \napproximately 5 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was planned to be enrolled \nin clinical sites in Japan.  \n2.\nAs of the PACL issued 15 May 2017, further enrollment of NSCLC patients into \nthe MET intermediate amplification group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment \nslots were transferred to the Enriched Other cohort to facilitate further enrollment of \npatients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a result, the total enrollment for patients \nwith MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was increased to 68 patients (50 patients + 13 \ntransferred slots + 5 Japanese patients). \n3.\nAs of the PACL issued 07 December 2017, sites were allowed to enroll an \nadditional 13 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC into the Enriched Other \ncohort.  These patients were originally slotted for the broader Enriched Other cohort and \n",

Ophthalmologic Exam Evaluable Set (Protocol Amendment #12 and Beyond)\nStarting with protocol Amendment #12, an ophthalmology exam was to be performed at \nscreening on all new patients; visual acuity, fundoscopy (vitreous body, retina macula, \nretina non-macula [peripheral], optic nerve head, and fundus*), biomicroscopy (cornea, \niris, lens, anterior chamber), and ocular characteristics were to be recorded.  The \nophthalmology examination was to be repeated during the study for patients who report a\nvisual disturbance or had an increase in grade for visual disturbances (for all ongoing \npatients). \n*The fundus (normal/abnormal/not done) was not recorded after protocol \nAmendment #17, which added other expanded ophthalmologic testing.\nOphthalmologic Exam Evaluable Set definitions has been updated to \u201cNSCLC Detailed \nOphthalmologic Exam - ITT Population\u201d and \u201cNSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam \n10 Tests \u2013 Evaluable Population\u201d in section 5.6 below.\n5.6. \u201cEvaluable\u201d Sets For NSCLC Ophthalmologic Analyses (Protocol \nAmendment #17 Through and Including Protocol Amendment #21)\nAll NSCLC patients enrolled under protocol Amendment #17 and beyond were to \nundergo the following expanded set of ophthalmology 10 assessments: \n\uf0b7\nBest corrected visual acuity (BCVA)\n\uf0b7\nRefractive error associated with BCVA\n\uf0b7\nPupil size/symmetry under standardized lighting conditions\n\uf0b7\nSlit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment including lids, conjunctiva, \nsclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris and lens\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 23 of 77\n\uf0b7\nIntraocular inflammation (cell count and aqueous flare)\n\uf0b7\nIntraocular pressure (IOP)\n\uf0b7\nFundoscopy, including vitreous body, retina macular, peripheral retina \nnon-macular, and optic nerve head \n\uf0b7\nDilated fundus photography of the macula, peripheral non-macular and optic \nnerve head\n\uf0b7\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) of the vitreous body and macula \n\uf0b7\nOcular characteristics including eye color and documentation of nevi or \nfreckles on the iris or conjunctiva bulbi \nThese tests were to be performed at screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, and \n2-8 weeks after the last dose of study medication (EOT); at protocol Amendment #20, \nannual examinations following Cycle 3 Day 1 until EOT were added to the schedule.  A \ntotal of at least 30 NSCLC patients are required to complete all exams on both eyes at all \ntimepoints.  While enrollment will continue until at least 30 NSCLC patients are tested \n(all examinations, both eyes) at Cycle 3 Day 1, it may be impractical to obtain complete \ndata at the EOT in this patient population. \nBy the time protocol Amendment #22 was finalized, at least 30 NSCLC patients had \ncompleted all examinations on both eyes at screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle \n3 Day 1.  Protocol Amendment #22 specified that the ophthalmic testing would revert to \nthe types of eye examinations and the schedule proscribed in protocol Amendment #12.  \nAccordingly, following the adoption of protocol Amendment #22, the CRFs used \nfollowing protocol Amendment #17 will be used for all newly enrolled patients, but only \nfor fundoscopy (posterior segment), biomicroscopy anterior segment, ocular \ncharacteristics, and visual acuity and only at screening and when changes are noted.  \nAlthough the tests going forward from protocol Amendment #22 are nominally the same \nas those collected from protocol Amendments #12 through #16, there are some minor \nchanges in the corresponding CRF pages adopted at protocol Amendment #17; the \nprotocol Amendment #17 versions will be used going forward.  The changes are as \nfollows:\n\uf0b7\nFundoscopy posterior segment CRF: \n\uf0b7\nEye structures collected per protocol Amendments #12 through #16:  vitreous \nbody, retina macula, retina non-macula (peripheral), optic nerve head, fundus\n\uf0b7\nEye structures collected per protocol Amendments #17 and beyond:  vitreous \nbody, retina macula, retina non-macula (peripheral), optic nerve head\n\uf0b7\nBiomicroscopy anterior segment CRF:\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 24 of 77\n\uf0b7\nEye structures collected per protocol Amendments #12 through #16:  cornea, \nanterior chamber, iris, lens\n\uf0b7\nEye structures collected per protocol Amendments #17 and beyond:  lids, \nconjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens\nReports of results for some cohorts may include summaries of ophthalmic parameters \nbased on the safety population for that cohort.  For reporting the ophthalmic results \nacross cohorts, the analysis populations are defined below.  The population definitions \nare aligned with the terminology used in the protocol, however the wording will be \nchanged for reporting purposes as appropriate: the word \u201csubject\u201d will replace \u201cpatients\u201d \nto match standard displays, and \u201ccrizotinib\u201d will replace \u201cPF-02341066\u201d for consistency \nin reporting across the program.\nNSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam - ITT Population\nThe NSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam \u2013 ITT population is defined as all NSCLC \npatients enrolled under Study Protocol Amendment #17 through Amendment #21 (except \nthose enrolled in the itraconazole DDI sub-study), who received at least one dose of \nPF-02341066, and who have data for at least one ophthalmology test at any timepoint. \nNSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam 10 Tests \u2013 Evaluable Population \nThe NSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam 10 Test \u2013 Evaluable Population is defined \nas patients included in the NSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam ITT population who \nhave complete screening, C1D15, and C3D1 data for all 10 assessments (visual acuity, \nrefractive error, biomicroscopy including intraocular inflammation (cell count and \naqueous flare), pupillary diameter, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy, color fundus \nphotography, and ocular coherence tomography) for both eyes. \nA patient is considered to have data for the specified ophthalmology test at a visit if the \ncorresponding CRFs for each eye (right and left) report results for all assessments.  The \nsummary on this population, which will form the basis of the submission to support the \npost-marketing requirement, will be performed when there are at least 30 patients with \nscreening, C1D15, and C3D1 data for both eyes on all 10 assessments completed \naccording to the guidelines provided to investigators.  The data available for other visits \nwill be listed.\n5.7. Hypogonadism Testing Results \nMale patients enrolled after IRB/EC approval of protocol Amendment #21 in the \nMET-amplified NSCLC and Enriched Other cohorts were to have additional laboratory \ntests for hypogonadism.  Required tests include: total testosterone, free testosterone, sex \nhormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, \ndihydroepiandosterone sulfate, estradiol, and prolactin.  Blood samples were scheduled to \nbe drawn on C1D1, C1D15, C2D1, C4D1, C6D1, and Day 1 of every 3 cycles thereafter \nas well as at 28 days following the last dose.  Blood draws were to be taken before \nPF-02341066 dosing and between 07:00 and 10:00 a.m. and, for each individual patient, \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 25 of 77\nthe time of the draw was to be as consistent across visits as feasible.  If either total \ntestosterone or free testosterone decreased to a value that is both 25% lower than baseline \nand below the lower limit of normal, then a repeat laboratory test of both parameters was \nto be performed at the next clinic visit to confirm hypogonadism. \nHypogonadism Test Evaluable Population \nThe Hypogonadism Test Evaluable Population is defined as patients included in the \nSafety Population who have complete screening and at least one post baseline visit data \nfor at least the key parameters of total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone \nbinding globulin (SHBG).  \n5.8.

If the \nday of the month is missing for a start date used in a calculation, the 1st of the month \nwill be used to replace the missing day.  Similarly, if both the day and month are \nmissing, the first day of the year is used.  For stop dates, the last day of the month or \nthe last day of the year is used if the day or both the day and month are missing, \nrespectively.  These rules are used unless the calculations result in negative time \ndurations (eg, date of resolution cannot be prior to date of onset).  In these cases, the \ndates resulting in 0 time duration will be used.  For PFS, OS, TTR, and DR, if \nconventions result in a negative duration, duration will be reset to 1 day.  For \nimputations for pharmacokinetic, ECG, and pharmacodynamics analyses, see \nSections 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4.\n7.2. Pharmacokinetics\nConcentrations below the limit of quantification\nIn all data presentations (except listings and plots presenting log-transformed \nconcentrations), concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be set to\nzero.  (In listings and plots using log-transformed measurements BLQ values will be \nreported as \u201c<LLQ\u201d, where LLQ will be replaced with the value for the lower limit of \nquantification.)\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 29 of 77\nDeviations, missing concentrations and anomalous values\nIn summary tables and plots of median profiles, statistics will be calculated with \nconcentrations set to missing if one of the following cases is true:\n1. A concentration has been reported as ND (ie, not done) or NS (ie, no sample)\n2. A deviation in sampling time is of sufficient concern or a concentration has \nbeen flagged anomalous by the pharmacokineticist\nNote that summary statistics will not be presented at a particular time point if more \nthan 50% of the data are missing.\nPharmacokinetic parameters\nActual PK sampling times will be used in the derivation of PK parameters.  Nominal \nPK sampling times may be used if the actual PK times are not recorded.\nIf a PK parameter cannot be derived from a patient\u2019s concentration data, the \nparameter will be coded as NC (ie, not calculated).  (Note that NC values will not be \ngenerated beyond the day that a patient discontinues from the study.)\nIn summary tables, statistics will not be presented for a particular treatment group if \nmore than 50% of the data are NC.  For statistical analyses (ie, analysis of variance), \nPK parameters coded as NC will also be set to missing.\nIf an individual patient has a known biased estimate of a PK parameter (for example \ndue to an unexpected event such as vomiting before all the drug is absorbed in the \nbody), this will be footnoted in summary tables and will not be included in the \ncalculation of summary statistics or statistical analyses.\n7.3. ECG Parameters\nFor analyses of ECG parameters, no values will be imputed for missing data except \nfor averaging of triplicate measurements.  If one or two of the triplicate measurements \nfor an ECG parameter are missing, the average of the remaining two measurements or \nthe single measurement can be used in the analyses.  If all triplicate measurements are \nmissing at a time point for an ECG parameter, no values will be imputed for this time \npoint and no analyses related to this time point will be performed. \n7.4.\n/Pharmacogenomic Parameters\nMissing data for the \n pharmacogenomic parameters will be \ntreated as such and no imputed values will be derived.\nCCI\nCCI\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 30 of 77\n8. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES\n8.1. Statistical Methods\nNo formal hypothesis testing will be performed in this \n study.  Estimates \nand confidence intervals will be generated as indicated, but p-values will not be \ncomputed unless otherwise indicated. \n8.1.1. Analyses of Binary Endpoint\nThe point estimates of the rates of binary endpoints will be provided along with the \ncorresponding exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals using the exact method based \non the F-distribution. \nAssume that each observation has a binary response recorded in variable resp in \ndataset xx.  Then the desired output, along with an output dataset yy, can be computed \nin SAS as shown below. \nproc freq data=xx;\n  table resp / binomial alpha = 0.05;\n  output out= yy binomial;\nrun;\nThe confidence interval will be given for the response category with the lower value \n(0 rather than 1, \u201cN\u201d rather than \u201cY\u201d).  To obtain the CI for the higher value, sort in \ndescending order and use the ORDER=DATA option.\n8.1.2. Analyses of Continuous and Categorical Data\nDescriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and \nmaximum values, will be provided for continuous endpoints.  The number and \npercentage of patients in each category will be presented for categorical variables. \n8.1.3. Analyses of Time-to-Event Endpoints \nTime-to-event endpoints (including DR, PFS, and OS) will be summarized using the \nKaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically when appropriate.  Median event \ntimes (and other quartiles) and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for each quartile will \nbe provided (Brookmeyer R and Crowley JJ). 2 TTR will be summarized using \ndescriptive statistics.\nAssume that the dataset xx has variables duration and censor for each patient, \nrecording the time to event and censoring variable (0=not censored, 1=censored).  \nThe desired output can be generated using SAS PROC LIFETEST, and saved in \ndataset yy, as follows:\nproc lifetest data = xx method =KM conftype = linear;\n  time duration*censor(1);\n  survival out=yy  conftype = linear;\nrun;\nCCI\n",

Adverse Events (AEs)\nAll AEs reported after initiation of treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1) and pre-existing \nconditions that worsen after the initiation of treatment will be considered as treatment \nemergent (Treatment Emergent Adverse Event: TEAE).  AEs will be coded by \nsystem organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to MedDRA \nterminology.  AE severity will be graded according to NCI Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 dated 12 December 2003. \nAn overall summary table of AEs will be provided.  This table will include the \nnumber and percentage of patients who experienced any: AE, serious AE (SAE), \ngrade 3 or 4 AE, grade 5 AE, and discontinued the study associated with an AE.  \nSummaries will be presented by dose level for the Dose Escalation cohort.  \nTreatment-related AEs are those judged by the investigator to have a reasonable \npossibility of being related to the study drug. \nEmphasis in the analyses will be placed on TEAEs.  TEAEs will be summarized by \nMedDRA SOC and PT.  A summary will also be provided by MedDRA SOC, PT and \nmaximum CTC severity grade and by maximum CTC grade group (Grade 1-2, Grade \n3-4, Grade 5), as appropriate.

Patients who withdrew from study treatment \nbecause of an AE will be listed.\nSAEs and treatment-related SAEs will be summarized by MedDRA SOC and PT.  \nPatients who experienced a SAE will be listed. \nThe most commonly experienced AEs (5% or more of patients) will also be \nsummarized by PT.  Similarly, the most commonly experienced SAEs (2% or more of \npatients) will be summarized by PT.\nListings of AEs including detailed information collected for each AE (description of \nevent, onset date/time, duration, seriousness, severity, relationship to study drug, \naction taken, and clinical outcome) will be presented.  This listing will include data \nfor AEs occurring between Day -7 and Cycle 1, Day 1 for patients receiving a dose of \nPF-02341066 prior to Cycle 1 Day1, as is the case for some interaction studies.\n8.2.2.3. Laboratory Data \nLaboratory data values for complete blood counts (hemoglobin, platelets, and WBC \nwith differentials-- neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocyte, monocytes, and basophils) \nand serum chemistry will be summarized for shift changes from baseline as \nappropriate; urinalysis summaries may also be presented.  Shift tables of laboratory \nparameters will also be presented as appropriate.  Lab shift tables may also be \nsummarized separately for Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and > Cycle 2 or other specified periods, \nas appropriate.  An e-DISH scatter plot of maximum ALT vs. maximum total \nbilirubin on study based on the upper limit of normal (ULN) also may be presented to \ncheck for cases of Hy\u2019s Law; a similar plot for maximum AST vs maximum total \nbilirubin on study may also be presented. \n8.2.2.4. Vital Signs  \nVital signs include pulse rate (beats per minute), systolic blood pressure (mmHg), \ndiastolic blood pressure (mmHg), temperature (\u00b0C), and weight (kg).

ECOG Performance Status \nECOG Performance Status data will be summarized.  Shift tables for ECOG \nperformance status from baseline to worst on study will be presented. \n8.2.2.6. 12-Lead ECG \n12-lead ECGs will be performed as per protocol.  The focus of these analyses will be \nto use changes in QTc from baseline to evaluate the frequency of patients \nexperiencing QTc prolongation.\nAt each time point, triplicate data will be averaged and all summary statistics and data \npresentations will use the triplicate averaged data.  Any data obtained from ECGs \nrepeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be averaged along \nwith the preceding triplicates.  QT measurements corrected by heart rate will be used \nfor the data analysis and interpretation.  The commonly used Bazett\u2019s and Fridericia\u2019s \ncorrection methods will be applied.  A study specific correction (QTcS) may also be \napplied.  The exponent for the study specific correction will be derived from a \npopulation modeling (further described in a separate document) and applied to \npresent the descriptive and central tendency analyses described in this SAP.\nDescriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) \nwill be used to summarize absolute values and changes from baseline in heart rate, \nQT, QTc (including but not limited to QTcB and QTcF), PR interval and QRS\ncomplex by dose and nominal postdose time points.  For each patient and by dose, the \nmaximum change from baseline for these parameters will be calculated as well as the \nmaximum post-baseline value across time-points. \nOverall central tendency analysis of the QTc data will be conducted and summarized \nas follows: Summary statistics (including 90% confidence limits) of changes from \nbaseline in QTcB, QTcF, and possibly QTcS will be presented for patients who \nreceived 250 mg BID dosing, as applicable, at each post-treatment time point. \nCategorical analysis of ECG data will also be conducted.  All planned and unplanned \npostdose time points will be counted in these categorical summaries.  Patients with \nQTc values of grade \u2265 3, >500 ms, or with maximum increase from baseline \u226560 ms \nwill separately be listed.\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 37 of 77\nCategorical analysis of the QTcF/QTcB data will be conducted and summarized as \nfollows:\n1. The number and percentage of patients with maximum increase from baseline \nin QTcF/QTcB (<30, 30- <60, and \u2265 60 ms)\n2. The number of and percentage patients with maximum postdose QTcF/QTcB \n(<450, 450-<480, 480- <500, and \u2265500 ms)\n3. PR interval changes from baseline \u2265 50% if absolute baseline value was \n< 200 ms, and \u2265 25% if absolute baseline value was \u2265 200 ms\n4.

Concomitant Medications \nAll medications received during the study will be considered as concomitant \nmedications and will be coded by WHO medical dictionary.  The version of the WHO \ndictionary used may vary by study cohort/sub-study due to changes over time in the \nstandard applied.  Concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class \nand WHO PT.  Because each drug taken by one or more patients is included in the \nsummary for all therapeutic classes in the WHO dictionary, the same concomitant \ndrug treatment may be included in multiple therapeutic classes.\nPatients who received concomitant medications will be listed.\n8.2.2.8. Ophthalmologic Testing (Protocol Amendment #12 \u2013 All Patients)\nThe discussion in this section pertains to analyses performed using the NSCLC \nDetailed Ophthalmologic analysis datasets described in Section 5.5 and 5.6.  As noted \nin that section, reports concentrating on individual cohorts may summarize the \nophthalmologic data based on the cohort-specific safety population.  In those cases, \nthe ophthalmologic summaries may deviate from the details provided below.  In \nparticular, for some cohorts, the overall results taking into consideration both eyes (as \ndistinct from separate results for the right and left eyes) may be omitted, and some \nparameters may not be summarized.\nAs of protocol Amendment #12, the following ophthalmologic examinations will be \nperformed for all patients at screening and repeated during the study when a visual \nchange occurred or when there is an increase in grade for a visual change: visual \nacuity, fundoscopy (vitreous body, retina macula, retina non-macula [peripheral], \noptic nerve head, and fundus), biomicroscopy (slit lamp examination: cornea, iris, \nlens, and anterior chamber), and ocular characteristics (eye color and freckles/nevi).  \nUsing these examinations, the analyses listed in this section will be applied to the \nOphthalmologic Exam Evaluable population.  If there are few patients with data \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 38 of 77\navailable for inclusion in a particular summary (eg, for visits having <10 non-missing \nvalues for the patients included in the report), summaries of those visits may be \nomitted, but all data will be listed. \nIn the following, baseline is defined as the assessment performed at screening.  \nAnalyses for visual acuity at baseline and ocular characteristics at baseline will be \nperformed separately for each eye (right/left).  Analyses for visual acuity worst \nchange from baseline, fundoscopy posterior segment, biomicroscopy (slit lamp) \nexams, and change from baseline in ocular characteristics will be performed \nseparately for each eye (right/left) and overall across eyes.  The overall summary \nrepresents the worst category across both eyes.  Annual and unscheduled assessments \nare included in the evaluation of the worst change from baseline category; when the \nsummary is across both eyes, then the worst scheduled or unscheduled post-baseline \nvalues for either eye is included in the summary.  For analyses of change from \nbaseline in ocular characteristics, the overall summary counts a patient once if there is \na change in either eye.\n\uf0b7\nBCVA\nBaseline: For baseline, the percentage of patients falling into each category \n(20/10, 20/13, etc.) based on Snellen equivalent will be summarized for each eye.  \nAll values for BCVA will be converted to the Snellen equivalent measured in feet \nas needed for summary purposes.  Fractions that are recorded in meters are \nconverted to feet by representing the recorded value as the ratio (20/3.28*y) \nwhere y is the value of the denominator in meters recorded on the CRF and the \nresulting denominator is rounded to the nearest whole number.\nWorst Change from Baseline: The worst change from baseline in BCVA will be \nsummarized for each eye separately and for the total across eyes using the \nfollowing categories: \u2265 3 line loss, 2 line loss, +1/-1 line, and > 1 line increase.  A \nchange in line of \u201c+1/-1 line\u201d represents no change from baseline in visual acuity.  \nThis summary will include patients with both a screening and at least one \npost-baseline assessment.  The overall summary will count patients once in the \nworst change category from baseline across both eyes.\nIf visual acuity at screening is provided as corrected, only corrected visual acuity \ndata are evaluable on study; otherwise changes cannot be assessed.  Similarly, if \nuncorrected visual acuity is collected at screening; on treatment data should be \nconsidered only if uncorrected.\n\uf0b7\nFundoscopy Posterior Segment\nSummaries will be provided separately for each item on the CRF applicable for \nthe group of patients included in the summary.

Expanded Ophthalmologic Testing (Protocol Amendment #17 \u2013 NSCLC \nPatients)\nThe discussion in this section pertains to analyses performed using the NSCLC \nDetailed Ophthalmologic analysis datasets described in Section 5.6.  As noted above, \nreports concentrating on individual cohorts may summarize the ophthalmologic data \nbased on the cohort-specific safety population and the summaries may deviate from \nthose described below.\nThis version of the SAP describes the analyses planned for the resubmission of the \nA8081001 Ophthalmology Report.  The original ophthalmology report (19Jun2014) \nincluded fewer than 30 patients who had completed all 10 tests, and the FDA \nrequested a resubmission including results for at least 30 patients who had complete \ndata.  Version 5 of the Statistical Analysis Plan (12Apr2014) described the analyses \nfor the original report.\nNote that all NSCLC patients enrolled after protocol Amendment #17 approval will \nundergo the following expanded set of 10 ophthalmology assessments: BCVA, \nrefractive error associated with BCVA, pupil size/symmetry under standardized \nlighting conditions, slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, intraocular \ninflammation (cell count and aqueous flare), IOP, fundoscopy, dilated fundus \nphotography, OCT, and ocular characteristics.  These tests are to be performed at \nscreening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, and 2-8 weeks after the last dose of study \nmedication (EOT); at protocol Amendment #20, annual examinations following \nCycle 3 Day 1 until EOT were added to the schedule.  Patients enrolled after approval \nof protocol Amendment #22 were no longer required to undergo the expanded testing, \nas described in Section 5.6.\nA total of at least 30 NSCLC patients are required to complete all examinations \nthrough Cycle 3, Day 1.  Due to patient inability/unwillingness to submit to the EOT \ntesting, it may be impractical to achieve a sample size of 30 at later timepoints.  In \norder to adequately describe the data available at the time of reporting, the following \nanalyses will be repeated for the populations described in Section 5.6 unless \notherwise specified: NSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam - ITT Population and \nNSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam All 10 Tests \u2013 Evaluable Population. \nGiven that NSCLC patients enrolled under protocol Amendment #17 and beyond \ninclude patients with a variety of molecular markers, summaries will also be \npresented overall and across cohorts: ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort, \nMET-amplified NSCLC cohort, ALK-negative NSCLC cohort #2, Rifampin \nsub-study (if NSCLC), and Enriched Other NSCLC cohort (as applicable).  \nAdditional summaries may be presented for separate cohorts. \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 41 of 77\nThe following tests of continuous measures will be summarized separately for right \nand left eyes: refractive error (spherical equivalent), intraocular pressure, optical \ncoherence tomography (center point), and external eye exam (pupillary \ndiameter/symmetry).  The following tests for categorical measures will be \nsummarized separately for right and left eye and summarized for the overall across \neyes: fundoscopy of the posterior segment, biomicroscopy of the anterior segment \n(including anterior chamber grading of aqueous flare and cell count), dilated fundus \nphotography, and optical coherence tomography.  Data at baseline for each \nassessment will be summarized by eye with worst change from baseline presented by \neye and for the overall across eyes.  Unscheduled assessments are included in the \nevaluation of the worst change from baseline category across both eyes.\nThe analyses of visual acuity, fundoscopy of the posterior segment, biomicroscopy of \nthe anterior segment, and ocular characteristics will be performed as described \npreviously for all patients following adoption of protocol Amendment #12 as \ndescribed in Section 5.5 and 5.6. \nAnalyses of additional endpoints are described below:\n\uf0b7\nRefractive error: Using the reported spherical numeric result (in diopters) and \nthe numeric cylinder result (in diopters), the spherical equivalent will be \ncalculated.  The spherical equivalent is defined as: spherical result + \u00bd cylinder \nresult.  The spherical equivalent and change from baseline in spherical equivalent \nwill be summarized using descriptive statistics for each timepoint separately by \neye (right/left).  For each eye, the spherical equivalent will be calculated as \n([0.5 \u00d7 cylinder] + spherical). \n\uf0b7\nExternal eye exam (including pupil size under standard lighting conditions): \nThe pupillary diameter (in millimeters) and change from baseline in pupillary \ndiameter will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each timepoint \nseparately by eye (right/left).

The average intraocular \npressure will be calculated for each patient by timepoint and eye using all \navailable measurements (including repeat measurements).  Using these averages, \ndescriptive statistics will be calculated for intraocular pressure and change from \nbaseline in intraocular pressure at each timepoint separately by eye (right/left).  \nPatients with an intraocular pressure > 22 mmHg will be listed.\n\uf0b7\nDilated fundus photographs (FP):\nBaseline:  For baseline, the percentage of pat Ophthalmologic Testing (Protocol \nAmendment \nients falling into each category of the examination status (normal, abnormal: not \nreported, abnormal: mild, abnormal: moderate, abnormal: severe, not done, not \nreported) will be summarized for each eye structure by eye and for overall across \neyes by each eye structure.  For the overall summary, patients are counted once \nfor the worst category across both eyes at baseline.\nWorst Change from Baseline: For post-baseline results, percentage of patients \nfalling into each category of the worst examination status on study (new \nfinding/worsening of findings, no change, improvement of findings, not done) \nwill be summarized for each eye structure by eye and for the total across eyes by \neach eye structure.

Patients with a center point of > 50 um will be listed.\nIn order to further describe the safety and baseline characteristics associated with \nthese ophthalmologic exams, additional analyses will be performed.  These include a \nsummary of subject disposition, demographic characteristics, treatment emergent \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 43 of 77\nadverse events (all causality) of eye disorders by PT and maximum CTC grade in \ndescending order of frequency, and treatment emergent adverse events \n(treatment-related) related to eye disorders by PT and maximum CTC grade in \ndescending order of frequency.  Similar tables will be generated for all causality AEs \nassociated with permanent treatment discontinuation, those associated with temporary \ntreatment discontinuation, and those associated with dose reduction; separate tables \nfor treatment-related AEs associated with permanent treatment discontinuation, those \nassociated with temporary treatment discontinuation, and those associated with dose \nreduction will also be provided.  In these AE summaries, the PTs associated with the \nSOC of Eye Disorders plus the clustered terms VISION DISORDER and VISUAL \nLOSS will be shown, as applicable; the PTs that define the clustered terms VISION \nDISORDER or VISUAL LOSS will not be individually listed in these tables.  \nHowever, additional tables of all causality and treatment-related AEs by clustered \nterm including the individual PTs within cluster for the VISION DISORDER and \nVISUAL LOSS clustered terms will be provided.

Description of the Itraconazole DDI Sub-study\nThis objective of this sub-study is to evaluate the effects of itraconazole on the \nmultiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066.\nThe study is based on 28-day cycles and is designed to evaluate the effect of \nitraconazole on the multiple-dose PK of PF-02341066 (Figure 1).  Approximately \n25 patients will be enrolled to obtain at least 8 evaluable patients for multiple-dose \nPK.  Patients who are enrolled in the study but not treated may be replaced to obtain \nat least 8 patients evaluable for multiple-dose PK.\nFigure 1.\nPF 02341066 and Itraconazole Schema: Multiple Dose Design\nEach patient is scheduled to receive treatment for two treatment periods in the \nMultiple Dose Design (A followed by B) as described below: \nTreatment Period A (Test): PF-02341066 250 mg QD will be administered \nfrom Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 15 and itraconazole 200 mg QD from \nCycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 1 Day 16 (before Cycle 1 Day \n16 PF-02341066 dosing).\nTreatment Period B (Reference): PF-02341066 250 mg QD will be \nadministered from Cycle 1 Day 16 to Cycle 2 Day 1.\nFollowing Cycle 2 Day 1, PF-02341066 250 mg BID dosing will be initiated for the \nremainder of the patient\u2019s participation. \n",

Handling of Missing Values\nAppendix 5.5.1. Concentrations Below the Limit of Quantitation\nIn all data presentations (except listings), PK concentrations below the limit of \nquantitation (BLQ) will be set to zero.  (In listings BLQ values will be reported as \n\u201c<LLQ\u201d, where LLQ will be replaced with the value for the lower limit of \nquantification.)  \nAppendix 5.5.2. Deviations, Missing Concentrations and Anomalous Values\nIn summary tables and plots of median profiles, statistics will be calculated having set \nPK concentrations to missing if 1 of the following cases is true:\n1. A PK concentration has been reported as ND (ie, not done) or NS (ie, no \nsample).\n2. A deviation in sampling time is of sufficient concern or a PK concentration \nhas been flagged anomalous by the pharmacokineticist.\nNote that summary statistics will not be presented at a particular time point if more \nthan 50% of the data are missing.\nAppendix 5.5.3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters\nActual PK sampling times will be used in the derivation of PK parameters, with the \nfollowing exceptions:  if time of dose is missing, nominal time postdose may be used; \nif sample collection time is missing, the concentration may be excluded from the \nanalysis.\nIf a PK parameter cannot be derived from a patient\u2019s concentration data, the \nparameter will be coded as NC (ie, not calculated).  (Note that NC values will not be \ngenerated beyond the day that a patient discontinues.)\nIn summary tables, statistics will be calculated by setting NC values to missing; \nstatistics will be presented for a particular treatment period with \uf0b33 evaluable \nmeasurements.  For statistical analyses (ie, analysis of variance), PK parameters \ncoded as NC will also be set to missing; analyses will not be performed for a \nparticular parameter if more than 50% of the data are NC.\nIf an individual patient has a known biased estimate of a PK parameter (eg, due to \nmissing dose(s) of PF-02341066 or itraconazole, or an unexpected event such as \nvomiting before all the compound was adequately absorbed in the body), this issue \nwill be footnoted in summary tables and the value will not be included in the \ncalculation of summary statistics or statistical analyses. \n",

INTRODUCTION\nThis document describes the planned statistical analyses for Protocol A8081001 dated \nDecember 5, 2005 and subsequent protocol Amendments #2 - #24 This SAP is meant to \nsupplement the study protocol.  A Supplemental SAP describes any additional analyses \nnot included in this main SAP that are planned for the ALK-positive NSCLC cohort, the \nROS1 marker positive NSCLC patients, and the MET Exon 14 alterations NSCLC \npatients identified in Table 5 of Section 8.2.  Any deviations from this main analysis plan \nor the supplemental analysis plan will be described in the Clinical Study Report.\n2.1. STUDY DESIGN\nStudy A8081001 is an open label, multi-center Phase 1 dose escalation, safety, \npharmacokinetic \n study of PF-02341066 in patients with advanced cancer.  \nThe initial design of the study focused on determining the dose limiting toxicities \n(DLTs), maximum tolerated dose, and recommended dose for Phase 2 studies (RP2D) for \nPF-02341066 administered twice a day (BID).  Assessments of evidence of antitumor \nactivity were also included. \nThe study includes a standard 3 + 3 design 1 for dose escalation component in patients \nwith advanced, solid tumors refractory to standard therapy.  Patients are enrolled in \ncohorts of three patients. The dose escalation component is followed by further \nevaluation of the RP2D in 2 cohorts.  The first RP2D cohort evaluates the potential for \nCYP3A inhibition due to PF-02341066 using midazolam (MDZ) as a probe.  The second \nRP2D cohort is composed of an enriched population and includes molecularly-defined \ngroups of patients who are predicted to have a clinical response to PF-02341066:\n\u2022\nALK-positive NSCLC cohort\nCCI\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 11 of 77\n\uf0b7\nMET amplified NSCLC cohort\n\uf0b7\nROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort\n\uf0b7\nEnriched Other cohort, including NSCLC patients with tumors harboring \nMET Exon 14 alterations (see below)\nIn addition, 2 ALK-negative NSCLC cohorts are evaluated at the RP2D.  A further dose \nescalation cohort was added to evaluate PF-02341066 administered once a day (QD).  \nAlso, 2 drug-drug interaction (DDI) sub-studies were added to assess the effect of the \nco-administration of rifampin, and separately of itraconazole, on the multiple-dose \npharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 BID. \nAlthough patients are enrolled in a single cohort/sub-study, some analyses (eg, analyses \nof ophthalmic data and analyses of hypogonadism data) are based on groups of patients \nwho are drawn from multiple cohort/sub-study enrollments.  Additionally, patients \nenrolled in one cohort may also be analyzed with patients in another cohort based on the \ntumor markers present. \nPatients who enroll in the Enriched Other cohort may well be a very diverse group, \nincluding patients who are positive for ALK chromosomal translocation (except for \npatients with NSCLC) or ALK gene amplification; or positive for known MET kinase \ndomain activating mutations; or having chromosomal translocations/ fusions that lead to \naltered transcriptional regulation of MET and/or HGF; or positive for chromosomal \ntranslocations at the ROS1 gene in other cancer types besides NCSLC; or NSCLC \npatients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations.  In this version of the SAP, \nreferences to handling of data pertaining to the Enriched Other cohort should in general \nbe understood to pertain to appropriately-defined subgroups of the Enriched cohort.  Such \nsubgroups will be defined when there are a sufficient number of patients who can be \nmeaningfully combined based on their tumors and tumor profiles.  At this time only the \nMET Exon 14 alteration subgroup has been identified for specific consideration in the \nEnriched Other cohort.\nNote the aforementioned groups are further defined in Appendix 1.\n2.2.

INTERIM ANALYSES, FINAL ANALYSES AND UNBLINDING\nThis is an open label, single-arm trial for which no formal interim analysis is planned.  \nThe final analysis will be performed after the last patient last visit; however, earlier \nanalyses of the data may be performed for publication and regulatory reporting purposes.\n4. HYPOTHESIS AND DECISION RULES\nA total of approximately 600 patients will be enrolled in this study including patients in \nthe dose escalation, RP2D, and DDI cohorts (rifampin and itraconazole).\n4.1. DOSE ESCALATION PHASE\nThe number of patients enrolled will depend upon the observed safety profile and study \nobjectives, which will determine the number of patients per dose level, the number of \ndose escalations and the number of cohorts.\nIt is anticipated that approximately 70 patients will be enrolled in the dose escalation \nphase of this study to determine both the QD MTD and the BID MTD. \nThe operating characteristics for the dose escalation part of this study design are shown in \nTable 1, which provides the probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each \nunderlying true DLT rate.  For example, for a toxicity that occurs in 5% of patients, there \nis a greater than 95% probability of escalating.  Conversely, for a common toxicity that \noccurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is <5%.\nC\nC\nI\nC\nC\nI\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 13 of 77\nTable 1.\nProbability of Escalation to the Next Dose for Each True Underlying \nDLT Rate at a Dose Level\nTrue Underlying \nDLT Rate (p)\n5%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\nProbability of \nEscalating Dose*\n0.97\n0.91\n0.71\n0.49\n0.31\n0.17\n0.08\n0.03\n0.01\n0.001\n*    Probability of escalation = (1-p)^3 + 3*p*(1-p)^5    \nTable 2 shows the probability of failing to observe toxicity in a sample size of 3 or \n6 patients given various true underlying toxicity rates.

RP2D COHORTS\nThe RP2D cohorts consisted of patients who were to receive the determined \nrecommended phase 2 dose (250 mg BID).

For example, 3 ALK-negative NSCLC patients (in ALK-negative NSCLC \ncohort #2) were also positive for the ROS1 marker and have also been analyzed with \npatients in the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort.  See the Supplemental SAP for \ndetails.  If there are other instances in which it is appropriate to include patients enrolled \nin one cohort in the analysis with patients in another cohort, summaries and analyses \ndescribed below will be modified as appropriate to accommodate different cycle lengths \nor other differences in data collection.  See Appendix 5, for details regarding the \nitraconazole DDI sub-study.\n4.2.1. RP2D NSCLC Cohorts for Molecularly-defined Patient Groups\nSee the Supplemental SAP for detailed descriptions of the analyses for ALK-positive \nNSCLC patients, the ROS1 marker positive NSCLC patients, and the MET Exon 14 \nalterations NSCLC patients.  The Supplemental SAP also includes detail regarding \nevaluation of response for RP2D cohorts that use RECIST 1.04 (ALK-positive NSCLC \ncohort, MET-amplified NSCLC cohort, and ROS1 marker positive NSCLC patients, and \nEnriched Other cohort) and separately for those that use RECIST 1.15 (ALK-negative \nNSCLC cohort #1 and ALK-negative NSCLC cohort #2).\n4.2.1.1. MET-Amplified NSCLC Cohort\nIn order to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with \nMET-amplified NSCLC, patients will be enrolled into one of the following categories:\n\uf0b7\nHigh Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio \u22655.0): as \ndocumented in Amendment # 24 and based on the Protocol Administrative \nClarification Letter (PACL) dated 15 May 2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cutoff for \nthis group was revised to \u22654.0.  As per the PACL dated 11 September 2018, this \ngroup was closed to further enrollment. The remaining 14 enrollment slots were \ntransferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations subgroup within the Enriched Other \ncohort.\n\uf0b7\nMedium Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio >2.2 to \n<5.0): as documented in Amendment # 24 and based on the PACL dated 15 May \n2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cutoff for this group was revised to >2.2 to \uf03c4.0; this \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 15 of 77\ngroup was closed to further enrollment.  The remaining 13 enrollment slots were \ntransferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations subgroup within the Enriched Other \ncohort.\n\uf0b7\nLow Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio \u22651.8 to \u22642.2) \nAs documented in Amendment # 22, this category was closed to enrollment as of \nNote to File 12 October 2015; 3 patients had been enrolled at that time.\nFor each category, an ORR of 10% was considered to be uninteresting for further study \nfor this category with 30% considered interesting for further exploration.  Using a Simon \noptimal two-stage design with alpha=0.05 and 80% power, a test of the null hypothesis \nthat p \u2264 10% versus the alternative p \u2265 30% requires 10 evaluable patients in the first \nstage.  If \u2264 1 objective response (CR or PR) is observed in the first 10 patients for any \ncategory, no additional patients in that category will be enrolled.  If 2 or more objective \nresponses are observed in the first stage for any category, the first stage may be expanded \nby enrolling 19 additional patients in that category.  However, upon completion and \nevaluation of the first stage, a decision will be made whether or not to expand to the \nsecond stage in any of the 3 categories investigated.  Within a category, if >5 objectives \nresponses are observed, the null hypothesis will be rejected.\n4.2.1.2. ALK-Negative NSCLC Cohort #1\nThe main objective of this ALK-negative NSCLC cohort was to evaluate the objective \nresponse in this group of patients and to compare with the objective response observed \nfrom ALK-positive NSCLC patients. This objective is now being addressed in the \nALK-negative cohort #2.\nFurther details regarding ALK-negative Cohort #1, including the sample size \ncomputations that were relevant at the time, are presented in the protocol.\n4.2.1.3. ALK-Negative NSCLC Cohort #2\nIn order to further characterize the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in ALK-negative \nNSCLC patients, at least 20 patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  These patients may \nhave been pre-screened by a local ALK test but only those who were determined to have \nALK-negative NSCLC by a central laboratory may be eligible for enrollment.  Initially, \nthe protocol specified that no molecular testing for MET or ROS1 should occur prior to \nenrollment.  As of a Note to File dated 19 June 2012 (at the time only 1 patient had been \nenrolled into this cohort), the requirement that no molecular testing for MET or ROS1 to \noccur prior to enrollment was removed.  Thus, MET or ROS1 testing may have been \nperformed prior to patient entry into this cohort.  However, if the test result for either \nMET or ROS1 was positive, then the patient could not be enrolled into this cohort.\nThe ALK-negative cohort #2 was driven partly by the belief that patients whose tumors \nwere negative by the Investigational Use Only (IUO) test, but positive by the Laboratory \nDeveloped Test (LDT) test, could benefit from PF-02341066 treatment.  Thus, the \nrationale for the ALK-negative NSCLC cohort #2 was to address questions regarding \nactivity in the ALK-negative NSCLC population where patients were \u201cpurely\u201d negative \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 16 of 77\n(ie, if pretesting was done, the local test must be negative and results of the local test \nneeded to be confirmed by the central laboratory before entry into the study). \n4.2.2. RP2D Enriched Other Cohort \nThe RP2D Enriched Other cohort includes all patients in RP2D who do not belong to one \nof the previously defined cohorts.  This enriched population will be used to evaluate the \nanti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with other molecular profiles that confer \nsensitivity to PF-02341066, in particular, patients who are positive for ALK \nchromosomal translocation (except for patients with NSCLC) or ALK gene \namplification; who are positive for known MET kinase domain activating mutations; who \nhave chromosomal translocations/ fusions that lead to altered transcriptional regulation of \nMET and/or HGF; or are positive for chromosomal translocations at the ROS1 gene in \nother cancer types besides NCSLC; or NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET \nExon 14 alterations.  The sample size of the Enriched Other cohort will be dependent \nupon the number of enrolled patients meeting the criteria for this cohort; however it is \nanticipated that approximately 171patients will be enrolled.  RECIST version 1.0 is used \nto assess tumor activity in this cohort. \nIn NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations, an ORR of 10% is \nconsidered to be uninteresting for further study for this group with 30% considered \ninteresting for further exploration.  With 33 evaluable patients, there is at least 90% \npower to test the null hypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 0.10 versus the \nalternative hypothesis that it is greater than 0.10 assuming an alternative target rate of \n0.30 with a one-sided \u03b1=0.05 based on a single stage design using exact test.  The null \nhypothesis will be rejected if \u2265 7 objective responses are observed among the first \n33 evaluable patients.  As of data cutoff date 01 August 2016, 11 confirmed objective \nresponses (CR, PR) were observed in a total of 28 response-evaluable patients with MET \nExon 14-positive NSCLC.  Based on the number of confirmed objective responses \nobserved, the null hypothesis was rejected. The proportion of responders will be \nestimated with better precision if the number of evaluable patients exceeds 33 patients.\n1.\nAs of Amendment 23 (21 February 2017), the sample size in the Enriched Other \ncohort was further increased to a total of 130 patients, including approximately \n50 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  In addition, a separate subgroup of \napproximately 5 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was planned to be enrolled \nin clinical sites in Japan.  \n2.\nAs of the PACL issued 15 May 2017, further enrollment of NSCLC patients into \nthe MET intermediate amplification group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment \nslots were transferred to the Enriched Other cohort to facilitate further enrollment of \npatients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a result, the total enrollment for patients \nwith MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was increased to 68 patients (50 patients + 13 \ntransferred slots + 5 Japanese patients). \n3.\nAs of the PACL issued 07 December 2017, sites were allowed to enroll an \nadditional 13 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC into the Enriched Other \ncohort.  These patients were originally slotted for the broader Enriched Other cohort and \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 17 of 77\nwere now assigned specifically to patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a \nresult, the total enrollment of the Enriched Other cohort subset of patients with MET \nExon 14-positive NSCLC increased to 81 patients (68 [defined in point 2 above] + 13 \npatients).  \n4.\nAs of the PACL issued 11 September 2018, further enrollment of NSCLC patients \ninto the MET high amplification group was closed and the remaining 14 enrollment slots \nwere transferred to the MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC subgroup within the Enriched \nOther cohort. As a result, the total enrollment for patients with MET Exon 14-positive \nNSCLC was increased to 103 patients (81 [defined in point 3 above] +14+8 [additional \nslots that were allowed without exceeding the total overall study enrollment of \napproximately 600 patients]).\n5.\nAs of the Investigator Communication Letter dated January 7, 2019, further \nenrollment of NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations was \nclosed.\n4.2.3. RP2D Midazolam Interaction Cohort\nThe MDZ Interaction cohort was used to evaluate the potential for CYP3A inhibition due \nto PF-02341066 using MDZ as a probe.  Eight evaluable patients will be required for the \nMDZ interaction sub-study in the RP2D cohort.  The effect of multiple doses of \nPF-02341066 on MDZ will be evaluated by estimating the AUC0-last ratio of MDZ in \npresence of PF-02341066 and MDZ alone.  Based on data from previous single dose \nMDZ studies conducted at Pfizer, it is estimated that the within-patient coefficient of \nvariation (CV) for the AUC0-\uf0a5data is 25%.  The standard deviation of the difference in \nlog-transformed data is then estimated to be 0.348 [(sqrt 2) *(sqrt(ln(1+ CV2)))].  If the \nestimated AUC ratio of MDZ (with PF-02341066 vs without PF-02341066) is 2 (a 100% \nincrease), then 8 patients will ensure that the width of the 90% confidence interval for the \nratio will be no longer than 1.12, with 80% probability.  (See Table 3)  A probable 90% \nconfidence interval is calculated to be: (1.52, 2.64).

RP2D Rifampin DDI Sub-study\nCo-administration of a single 250 mg PF-02341066 dose with rifampin (600 mg QD), a \nstrong CYP3A inducer, resulted in 81.8% and 68.5% decreases in PF-02341066 AUCinf\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 18 of 77\nand Cmax, respectively, compared to when PF 02341066 was given alone.  This study was \nproposed to evaluate the effect of rifampin (600 mg QD) on multiple-dose PK of \nPF-02341066 after repeated 250 mg BID dosing.  A sample size of 8 evaluable patients, \nwho complete full PK sampling for PF-02341066 on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1, \nis recommended for the rifampin DDI sub-study in the RP2D cohort.  A total of \napproximately 25 patients will be enrolled into this cohort to obtain the 8 evaluable \npatients (to account for loss of patients due to early discontinuations, inadequate dosing, \netc.)  Eight evaluable patients will provide 90% confidence intervals for the difference \nbetween treatments of \u00b1 0. 276 on the natural log scale for steady state AUC (AUCss), \nwith 80% coverage probability.  An approximately 36% decrease in PF-02341066 AUCss \nis anticipated when co-administered with rifampin. (See Table 4)  Table 4 presents the \nwidth of 90% confidence intervals for the AUC ratio for different estimated effects \nassuming a within-patient coefficient of variation (CV) of 25%.

Ophthalmologic Exam Evaluable Set (Protocol Amendment #12 and Beyond)\nStarting with protocol Amendment #12, an ophthalmology exam was to be performed at \nscreening on all new patients; visual acuity, fundoscopy (vitreous body, retina macula, \nretina non-macula [peripheral], optic nerve head, and fundus*), biomicroscopy (cornea, \niris, lens, anterior chamber), and ocular characteristics were to be recorded.  The \nophthalmology examination was to be repeated during the study for patients who report a\nvisual disturbance or had an increase in grade for visual disturbances (for all ongoing \npatients). \n*The fundus (normal/abnormal/not done) was not recorded after protocol \nAmendment #17, which added other expanded ophthalmologic testing.\nOphthalmologic Exam Evaluable Set definitions has been updated to \u201cNSCLC Detailed \nOphthalmologic Exam - ITT Population\u201d and \u201cNSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam \n10 Tests \u2013 Evaluable Population\u201d in section 5.6 below.\n5.6. \u201cEvaluable\u201d Sets For NSCLC Ophthalmologic Analyses (Protocol \nAmendment #17 Through and Including Protocol Amendment #21)\nAll NSCLC patients enrolled under protocol Amendment #17 and beyond were to \nundergo the following expanded set of ophthalmology 10 assessments: \n\uf0b7\nBest corrected visual acuity (BCVA)\n\uf0b7\nRefractive error associated with BCVA\n\uf0b7\nPupil size/symmetry under standardized lighting conditions\n\uf0b7\nSlit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment including lids, conjunctiva, \nsclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris and lens\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 23 of 77\n\uf0b7\nIntraocular inflammation (cell count and aqueous flare)\n\uf0b7\nIntraocular pressure (IOP)\n\uf0b7\nFundoscopy, including vitreous body, retina macular, peripheral retina \nnon-macular, and optic nerve head \n\uf0b7\nDilated fundus photography of the macula, peripheral non-macular and optic \nnerve head\n\uf0b7\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) of the vitreous body and macula \n\uf0b7\nOcular characteristics including eye color and documentation of nevi or \nfreckles on the iris or conjunctiva bulbi \nThese tests were to be performed at screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, and \n2-8 weeks after the last dose of study medication (EOT); at protocol Amendment #20, \nannual examinations following Cycle 3 Day 1 until EOT were added to the schedule.  A \ntotal of at least 30 NSCLC patients are required to complete all exams on both eyes at all \ntimepoints.  While enrollment will continue until at least 30 NSCLC patients are tested \n(all examinations, both eyes) at Cycle 3 Day 1, it may be impractical to obtain complete \ndata at the EOT in this patient population. \nBy the time protocol Amendment #22 was finalized, at least 30 NSCLC patients had \ncompleted all examinations on both eyes at screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle \n3 Day 1.  Protocol Amendment #22 specified that the ophthalmic testing would revert to \nthe types of eye examinations and the schedule proscribed in protocol Amendment #12.  \nAccordingly, following the adoption of protocol Amendment #22, the CRFs used \nfollowing protocol Amendment #17 will be used for all newly enrolled patients, but only \nfor fundoscopy (posterior segment), biomicroscopy anterior segment, ocular \ncharacteristics, and visual acuity and only at screening and when changes are noted.  \nAlthough the tests going forward from protocol Amendment #22 are nominally the same \nas those collected from protocol Amendments #12 through #16, there are some minor \nchanges in the corresponding CRF pages adopted at protocol Amendment #17; the \nprotocol Amendment #17 versions will be used going forward.  The changes are as \nfollows:\n\uf0b7\nFundoscopy posterior segment CRF: \n\uf0b7\nEye structures collected per protocol Amendments #12 through #16:  vitreous \nbody, retina macula, retina non-macula (peripheral), optic nerve head, fundus\n\uf0b7\nEye structures collected per protocol Amendments #17 and beyond:  vitreous \nbody, retina macula, retina non-macula (peripheral), optic nerve head\n\uf0b7\nBiomicroscopy anterior segment CRF:\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 24 of 77\n\uf0b7\nEye structures collected per protocol Amendments #12 through #16:  cornea, \nanterior chamber, iris, lens\n\uf0b7\nEye structures collected per protocol Amendments #17 and beyond:  lids, \nconjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens\nReports of results for some cohorts may include summaries of ophthalmic parameters \nbased on the safety population for that cohort.  For reporting the ophthalmic results \nacross cohorts, the analysis populations are defined below.

The \nsummary on this population, which will form the basis of the submission to support the \npost-marketing requirement, will be performed when there are at least 30 patients with \nscreening, C1D15, and C3D1 data for both eyes on all 10 assessments completed \naccording to the guidelines provided to investigators.  The data available for other visits \nwill be listed.\n5.7. Hypogonadism Testing Results \nMale patients enrolled after IRB/EC approval of protocol Amendment #21 in the \nMET-amplified NSCLC and Enriched Other cohorts were to have additional laboratory \ntests for hypogonadism.  Required tests include: total testosterone, free testosterone, sex \nhormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, \ndihydroepiandosterone sulfate, estradiol, and prolactin.  Blood samples were scheduled to \nbe drawn on C1D1, C1D15, C2D1, C4D1, C6D1, and Day 1 of every 3 cycles thereafter \nas well as at 28 days following the last dose.  Blood draws were to be taken before \nPF-02341066 dosing and between 07:00 and 10:00 a.m. and, for each individual patient, \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 25 of 77\nthe time of the draw was to be as consistent across visits as feasible.  If either total \ntestosterone or free testosterone decreased to a value that is both 25% lower than baseline \nand below the lower limit of normal, then a repeat laboratory test of both parameters was \nto be performed at the next clinic visit to confirm hypogonadism. \nHypogonadism Test Evaluable Population \nThe Hypogonadism Test Evaluable Population is defined as patients included in the \nSafety Population who have complete screening and at least one post baseline visit data \nfor at least the key parameters of total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone \nbinding globulin (SHBG).  \n5.8.

If the \nday of the month is missing for a start date used in a calculation, the 1st of the month \nwill be used to replace the missing day.  Similarly, if both the day and month are \nmissing, the first day of the year is used.

These rules are used unless the calculations result in negative time \ndurations (eg, date of resolution cannot be prior to date of onset).  In these cases, the \ndates resulting in 0 time duration will be used.  For PFS, OS, TTR, and DR, if \nconventions result in a negative duration, duration will be reset to 1 day.

(In listings and plots using log-transformed measurements BLQ values will be \nreported as \u201c<LLQ\u201d, where LLQ will be replaced with the value for the lower limit of \nquantification.)\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 29 of 77\nDeviations, missing concentrations and anomalous values\nIn summary tables and plots of median profiles, statistics will be calculated with \nconcentrations set to missing if one of the following cases is true:\n1. A concentration has been reported as ND (ie, not done) or NS (ie, no sample)\n2. A deviation in sampling time is of sufficient concern or a concentration has \nbeen flagged anomalous by the pharmacokineticist\nNote that summary statistics will not be presented at a particular time point if more \nthan 50% of the data are missing.\nPharmacokinetic parameters\nActual PK sampling times will be used in the derivation of PK parameters.  Nominal \nPK sampling times may be used if the actual PK times are not recorded.\nIf a PK parameter cannot be derived from a patient\u2019s concentration data, the \nparameter will be coded as NC (ie, not calculated).  (Note that NC values will not be \ngenerated beyond the day that a patient discontinues from the study.)\nIn summary tables, statistics will not be presented for a particular treatment group if \nmore than 50% of the data are NC.  For statistical analyses (ie, analysis of variance), \nPK parameters coded as NC will also be set to missing.\nIf an individual patient has a known biased estimate of a PK parameter (for example \ndue to an unexpected event such as vomiting before all the drug is absorbed in the \nbody), this will be footnoted in summary tables and will not be included in the \ncalculation of summary statistics or statistical analyses.\n7.3. ECG Parameters\nFor analyses of ECG parameters, no values will be imputed for missing data except \nfor averaging of triplicate measurements.  If one or two of the triplicate measurements \nfor an ECG parameter are missing, the average of the remaining two measurements or \nthe single measurement can be used in the analyses.  If all triplicate measurements are \nmissing at a time point for an ECG parameter, no values will be imputed for this time \npoint and no analyses related to this time point will be performed. \n7.4.\n/Pharmacogenomic Parameters\nMissing data for the \n pharmacogenomic parameters will be \ntreated as such and no imputed values will be derived.\nCCI\nCCI\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 30 of 77\n8. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES\n8.1. Statistical Methods\nNo formal hypothesis testing will be performed in this \n study.  Estimates \nand confidence intervals will be generated as indicated, but p-values will not be \ncomputed unless otherwise indicated. \n8.1.1. Analyses of Binary Endpoint\nThe point estimates of the rates of binary endpoints will be provided along with the \ncorresponding exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals using the exact method based \non the F-distribution. \nAssume that each observation has a binary response recorded in variable resp in \ndataset xx.  Then the desired output, along with an output dataset yy, can be computed \nin SAS as shown below. \nproc freq data=xx;\n  table resp / binomial alpha = 0.05;\n  output out= yy binomial;\nrun;\nThe confidence interval will be given for the response category with the lower value \n(0 rather than 1, \u201cN\u201d rather than \u201cY\u201d).  To obtain the CI for the higher value, sort in \ndescending order and use the ORDER=DATA option.\n8.1.2. Analyses of Continuous and Categorical Data\nDescriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and \nmaximum values, will be provided for continuous endpoints.

Analyses of Time-to-Event Endpoints \nTime-to-event endpoints (including DR, PFS, and OS) will be summarized using the \nKaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically when appropriate.  Median event \ntimes (and other quartiles) and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for each quartile will \nbe provided (Brookmeyer R and Crowley JJ). 2 TTR will be summarized using \ndescriptive statistics.\nAssume that the dataset xx has variables duration and censor for each patient, \nrecording the time to event and censoring variable (0=not censored, 1=censored).  \nThe desired output can be generated using SAS PROC LIFETEST, and saved in \ndataset yy, as follows:\nproc lifetest data = xx method =KM conftype = linear;\n  time duration*censor(1);\n  survival out=yy  conftype = linear;\nrun;\nCCI\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 31 of 77\n8.2. Statistical Analyses\nTable 5 displays cohorts/subgroups that will be referenced in the following sections.  \nAnalyses will be performed separately for these cohorts/subgroups unless otherwise \nspecified.  Additional subgroup analyses (eg, by race) will be provided, as \nappropriate.\nAppendix 1 provides definitions of the cohorts/subgroups in Table 5 based on the \nCRF.

See the Supplemental SAP for details. \n***This cohort is defined as all patients in RP2D who are not in one of the other RP2D cohorts. \nThe above cohorts are defined for enrollment purpose, but the cohorts are not \nnecessarily mutually exclusive for purposes of analysis.  A patient who is enrolled to \na specific cohort (eg, an ALK-negative NSCLC cohort) at the time of study entry may \nsubsequently be determined through molecular testing to be positive for a marker \nrelevant to another cohort (eg, ROS1 marker positive NSCLC or MET amplified \nNSCLC).  In this case, such patients may be pooled in the other cohort and/or \nsummarized as a subgroup within their initial cohort as appropriate as long as the \npatient meets the definitions as described in Appendix 1 for the relevant cohort for \nanalysis.\nFor the High Dose Escalation, MET amplified NSCLC, MET Exon 14 NSCLC, \nEnriched Other cohorts, all efficacy and safety analyses will be conducted separately \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 32 of 77\nwithin each cohort according to the previous sections in this SAP and supplemental \nSAP. \nFor the cohorts that were previously reported and with ongoing patients at the time of \nprevious data cutoff including ALK Positive NSCLC, ALK negative NSCLC #1, \nALK negative NSCLC #2, ROS 1 marker positive NSCLC, Rifampin DDI, \nItraconazole DDI, all previously reported efficacy analyses were included in the \nCSRs associated with these cohorts.  There will be no updated efficacy analyses for \nthese cohorts.  The safety analyses including patient disposition, demographic and \nbaseline characteristics, treatment administration, protocol deviation, primary \ndiagnosis, AE, SAE, permanent discontinuation, temporary discontinuation, dose \nreduction, death, e-DISH plots, lab shift summaries, vital sign and ECG summaries \nwill be updated in the final CSR. \n8.2.1. Standard Analyses\nThe safety analysis set will be used for all standard analyses except for the overall \ndisposition table which will be presented for all enrolled patients. \nDescriptive statistics will be used to summarize study conduct, patient disposition, \nbaseline characteristics, and treatment administration/compliance.  Analyses will be \npresented separately based on the cohorts in Table 5. \nStudy Conduct and Patient Disposition \nAn accounting of the study patients will be tabulated.  The number and percentage of \npatients in each of the cohorts listed in Table 5 will be presented. \nReasons for discontinuations during the treatment period will be summarized based \non the Subject Summary CRF.  Patients discontinuing during the treatment period will \nalso be listed along with the reasons for discontinuation.  Disposition by cycle will \nalso be presented for specific cohorts, as appropriate.\nDemographics and Baseline Characteristics \nDemographic characteristics including age, age category (<65, \u226565), gender, race, \nheight (cm), and weight (kg) will be summarized.  Weight is based on information \ncollected at screening from the demography CRF page. \nBaseline and disease characteristics will be summarized including smoking \nclassification, primary diagnosis, time (years) from primary diagnosis to first day of \ndosing, current disease stage, histological classification, ECOG performance status, \nprior therapy, and medical history (past/present); best response to prior therapy may \nalso be summarized.  Time (years) from primary diagnosis to Day 1 of study is \ncalculated as first dose date minus date of primary diagnosis plus 1 divided by \n365.25.  For ECOG performance status, baseline is the Cycle 1 Day 1 value, unless it \nis missing, in which case the screening value is used.\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 33 of 77\nFor the RP2D cohorts summaries of prior therapy may include the following:\n1. number of prior regimens [categories 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026, K-1, \u2265 K, as appropriate]\n2. number of prior metastatic regimens [categories as appropriate, see above] \n3. prior radiation therapy [yes/no]\n4. prior cancer surgery [yes/no] \n5. type of prior treatment regimen (neoadjuvant/adjuvant, advanced/metastatic)\n6. type of prior metastatic therapy (eg, platinum-based therapies, EDFR TKIs, \nother TKIs, hormonal as available in the data, with subcategories \nneoadjuvant/adjuvant, advanced/metastatic, as applicable for the data being \nsummarized)\n7. best response to prior metastatic therapy by type of therapy, as appropriate \nTreatment Administration/Compliance\nStudy drug administration will be described in terms of the following items, as \nappropriate (cohort/sub-study specific details below):\n1. total number of cycles started\n2. the median number (range) of cycles started\n3. duration of treatment (weeks or months)\n4. duration of treatment categories\n5. dose reductions\n6. dose interruptions\n7. dose intensity\n8. dose intensity by cycle\nReports for different RP2D cohorts and sub-studies will include different summaries:\nALK-negative NSCLC #1 cohort: \nitems 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nALK-negative NSCLC #2 cohort: \nitems 1-6\nALK-positive NSCLC cohort: \nitems 1-4, 6-8\nMET-amplified NSCLC cohort: \nitems 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort:                items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nMET Exon 14 alteration NSCLC patients: \nitems 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nEnriched Other cohort:\nitems 1-7, as appropriate\n(Note that the Enriched Other cohort may be summarized in various \nsubsets of patients with similar characteristics; different subsets may \nhave different reporting requirements.)\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 34 of 77\nRifampin sub-study: \nitems 1, 2, 5, 6\n(with period-specific summaries as appropriate)\nItraconazole sub-study: \nitems 1, 2, 5, 6\n(with period-specific summaries as appropriate)\n8.2.2.

Adverse Events (AEs)\nAll AEs reported after initiation of treatment (Cycle 1, Day 1) and pre-existing \nconditions that worsen after the initiation of treatment will be considered as treatment \nemergent (Treatment Emergent Adverse Event: TEAE).  AEs will be coded by \nsystem organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to MedDRA \nterminology.  AE severity will be graded according to NCI Common Terminology \nCriteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 dated 12 December 2003. \nAn overall summary table of AEs will be provided.  This table will include the \nnumber and percentage of patients who experienced any: AE, serious AE (SAE), \ngrade 3 or 4 AE, grade 5 AE, and discontinued the study associated with an AE.  \nSummaries will be presented by dose level for the Dose Escalation cohort.  \nTreatment-related AEs are those judged by the investigator to have a reasonable \npossibility of being related to the study drug. \nEmphasis in the analyses will be placed on TEAEs.  TEAEs will be summarized by \nMedDRA SOC and PT.  A summary will also be provided by MedDRA SOC, PT and \nmaximum CTC severity grade and by maximum CTC grade group (Grade 1-2, Grade \n3-4, Grade 5), as appropriate.  Tables may also be presented for Cycle 1 and Cycle \n>1 or other periods, as specified in Appendix 2.  A summary of TEAEs by PT \n(decreasing frequency) will also be presented.  The aforementioned summaries will \nalso be presented by relationship to study drug.  Summary tables may also be \ngenerated for clustered adverse events which are events which combine several PTs \nassociated with an event of interest (eg, events associated with visual disturbance).  \nThe clustered events are described in a list in the product\u2019s Safety Review Plan \nmaintained by the Sponsor.\nPatient deaths will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage of \npatients for each cause of death.  Deaths will be presented separately \u201con-treatment\u201d \nand during follow-up.  Deaths that occurred on or after first dose of study medication \nand within 28 days after the last dose of study medication are defined as on-treatment \ndeaths.  Patients who died will also be listed.\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 35 of 77\nSummaries will also be provided for AEs associated with dose reduction, dose \ninterruptions, AEs associated with discontinuation of treatment, and SAEs associated \nwith discontinuation of treatment.  Patients who withdrew from study treatment \nbecause of an AE will be listed.\nSAEs and treatment-related SAEs will be summarized by MedDRA SOC and PT.  \nPatients who experienced a SAE will be listed. \nThe most commonly experienced AEs (5% or more of patients) will also be \nsummarized by PT.  Similarly, the most commonly experienced SAEs (2% or more of \npatients) will be summarized by PT.\nListings of AEs including detailed information collected for each AE (description of \nevent, onset date/time, duration, seriousness, severity, relationship to study drug, \naction taken, and clinical outcome) will be presented.  This listing will include data \nfor AEs occurring between Day -7 and Cycle 1, Day 1 for patients receiving a dose of \nPF-02341066 prior to Cycle 1 Day1, as is the case for some interaction studies.\n8.2.2.3. Laboratory Data \nLaboratory data values for complete blood counts (hemoglobin, platelets, and WBC \nwith differentials-- neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocyte, monocytes, and basophils) \nand serum chemistry will be summarized for shift changes from baseline as \nappropriate; urinalysis summaries may also be presented.  Shift tables of laboratory \nparameters will also be presented as appropriate.  Lab shift tables may also be \nsummarized separately for Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and > Cycle 2 or other specified periods, \nas appropriate.  An e-DISH scatter plot of maximum ALT vs. maximum total \nbilirubin on study based on the upper limit of normal (ULN) also may be presented to \ncheck for cases of Hy\u2019s Law; a similar plot for maximum AST vs maximum total \nbilirubin on study may also be presented. \n8.2.2.4. Vital Signs  \nVital signs include pulse rate (beats per minute), systolic blood pressure (mmHg), \ndiastolic blood pressure (mmHg), temperature (\u00b0C), and weight (kg).  Descriptive \nstatistics will be presented by timepoint for each vital sign and for change from \nbaseline. \nThe number and percent of patients meeting the criteria for each of the following \ncategories during the study will also be presented:\n\uf0b7\nPulse Rate\nOn-study values: maximum >120 bpm or minimum <50 bpm\nChange from baseline (increase or decrease) of \uf0b330 bpm\n\uf0b7\nBlood Pressure\nChange from baseline (increase or decrease) in SBP of \uf0b340 mmHg\nChange from baseline (decrease) in SBP of \uf0b360 mmHg\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 36 of 77\nChange from baseline in DBP (increase or decrease) of \uf0b320 mmHg\nChange from baseline in DBP (decrease) of \uf0b340 mmHg\n\uf0b7\nBody Weight\nPercent change from baseline (increase or decrease) of \uf0b310%\nPatients who have a cardiac pacemaker implanted prior to enrollment will be \nexcluded from all summaries of pulse rate.  All data will be listed, and an appropriate \nfootnote will be added to all relevant displays if there are any patients removed from \nsummaries due to a cardiac pacemaker.\n8.2.2.5. ECOG Performance Status \nECOG Performance Status data will be summarized.  Shift tables for ECOG \nperformance status from baseline to worst on study will be presented. \n8.2.2.6. 12-Lead ECG \n12-lead ECGs will be performed as per protocol.  The focus of these analyses will be \nto use changes in QTc from baseline to evaluate the frequency of patients \nexperiencing QTc prolongation.\nAt each time point, triplicate data will be averaged and all summary statistics and data \npresentations will use the triplicate averaged data.  Any data obtained from ECGs \nrepeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be averaged along \nwith the preceding triplicates.  QT measurements corrected by heart rate will be used \nfor the data analysis and interpretation.  The commonly used Bazett\u2019s and Fridericia\u2019s \ncorrection methods will be applied.  A study specific correction (QTcS) may also be \napplied.  The exponent for the study specific correction will be derived from a \npopulation modeling (further described in a separate document) and applied to \npresent the descriptive and central tendency analyses described in this SAP.\nDescriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) \nwill be used to summarize absolute values and changes from baseline in heart rate, \nQT, QTc (including but not limited to QTcB and QTcF), PR interval and QRS\ncomplex by dose and nominal postdose time points.  For each patient and by dose, the \nmaximum change from baseline for these parameters will be calculated as well as the \nmaximum post-baseline value across time-points. \nOverall central tendency analysis of the QTc data will be conducted and summarized \nas follows: Summary statistics (including 90% confidence limits) of changes from \nbaseline in QTcB, QTcF, and possibly QTcS will be presented for patients who \nreceived 250 mg BID dosing, as applicable, at each post-treatment time point. \nCategorical analysis of ECG data will also be conducted.  All planned and unplanned \npostdose time points will be counted in these categorical summaries.  Patients with \nQTc values of grade \u2265 3, >500 ms, or with maximum increase from baseline \u226560 ms \nwill separately be listed.\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 37 of 77\nCategorical analysis of the QTcF/QTcB data will be conducted and summarized as \nfollows:\n1. The number and percentage of patients with maximum increase from baseline \nin QTcF/QTcB (<30, 30- <60, and \u2265 60 ms)\n2. The number of and percentage patients with maximum postdose QTcF/QTcB \n(<450, 450-<480, 480- <500, and \u2265500 ms)\n3. PR interval changes from baseline \u2265 50% if absolute baseline value was \n< 200 ms, and \u2265 25% if absolute baseline value was \u2265 200 ms\n4. QRS complex changes from baseline \u2265 50% if absolute baseline value was \n< 100 ms, and \u2265 25% if absolute baseline value was \u2265 100 ms\nIndividual patient ECG data listings (including a listing of qualitative results) will be \ngenerated. \n8.2.2.7. Concomitant Medications \nAll medications received during the study will be considered as concomitant \nmedications and will be coded by WHO medical dictionary.  The version of the WHO \ndictionary used may vary by study cohort/sub-study due to changes over time in the \nstandard applied.  Concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class \nand WHO PT.  Because each drug taken by one or more patients is included in the \nsummary for all therapeutic classes in the WHO dictionary, the same concomitant \ndrug treatment may be included in multiple therapeutic classes.\nPatients who received concomitant medications will be listed.\n8.2.2.8. Ophthalmologic Testing (Protocol Amendment #12 \u2013 All Patients)\nThe discussion in this section pertains to analyses performed using the NSCLC \nDetailed Ophthalmologic analysis datasets described in Section 5.5 and 5.6.  As noted \nin that section, reports concentrating on individual cohorts may summarize the \nophthalmologic data based on the cohort-specific safety population.  In those cases, \nthe ophthalmologic summaries may deviate from the details provided below.  In \nparticular, for some cohorts, the overall results taking into consideration both eyes (as \ndistinct from separate results for the right and left eyes) may be omitted, and some \nparameters may not be summarized.\nAs of protocol Amendment #12, the following ophthalmologic examinations will be \nperformed for all patients at screening and repeated during the study when a visual \nchange occurred or when there is an increase in grade for a visual change: visual \nacuity, fundoscopy (vitreous body, retina macula, retina non-macula [peripheral], \noptic nerve head, and fundus), biomicroscopy (slit lamp examination: cornea, iris, \nlens, and anterior chamber), and ocular characteristics (eye color and freckles/nevi).  \nUsing these examinations, the analyses listed in this section will be applied to the \nOphthalmologic Exam Evaluable population.  If there are few patients with data \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 38 of 77\navailable for inclusion in a particular summary (eg, for visits having <10 non-missing \nvalues for the patients included in the report), summaries of those visits may be \nomitted, but all data will be listed. \nIn the following, baseline is defined as the assessment performed at screening.  \nAnalyses for visual acuity at baseline and ocular characteristics at baseline will be \nperformed separately for each eye (right/left).  Analyses for visual acuity worst \nchange from baseline, fundoscopy posterior segment, biomicroscopy (slit lamp) \nexams, and change from baseline in ocular characteristics will be performed \nseparately for each eye (right/left) and overall across eyes.  The overall summary \nrepresents the worst category across both eyes.  Annual and unscheduled assessments \nare included in the evaluation of the worst change from baseline category; when the \nsummary is across both eyes, then the worst scheduled or unscheduled post-baseline \nvalues for either eye is included in the summary.  For analyses of change from \nbaseline in ocular characteristics, the overall summary counts a patient once if there is \na change in either eye.\n\uf0b7\nBCVA\nBaseline: For baseline, the percentage of patients falling into each category \n(20/10, 20/13, etc.) based on Snellen equivalent will be summarized for each eye.  \nAll values for BCVA will be converted to the Snellen equivalent measured in feet \nas needed for summary purposes.  Fractions that are recorded in meters are \nconverted to feet by representing the recorded value as the ratio (20/3.28*y) \nwhere y is the value of the denominator in meters recorded on the CRF and the \nresulting denominator is rounded to the nearest whole number.\nWorst Change from Baseline: The worst change from baseline in BCVA will be \nsummarized for each eye separately and for the total across eyes using the \nfollowing categories: \u2265 3 line loss, 2 line loss, +1/-1 line, and > 1 line increase.  A \nchange in line of \u201c+1/-1 line\u201d represents no change from baseline in visual acuity.  \nThis summary will include patients with both a screening and at least one \npost-baseline assessment.  The overall summary will count patients once in the \nworst change category from baseline across both eyes.\nIf visual acuity at screening is provided as corrected, only corrected visual acuity \ndata are evaluable on study; otherwise changes cannot be assessed.  Similarly, if \nuncorrected visual acuity is collected at screening; on treatment data should be \nconsidered only if uncorrected.\n\uf0b7\nFundoscopy Posterior Segment\nSummaries will be provided separately for each item on the CRF applicable for \nthe group of patients included in the summary.  Patients enrolled under protocol \nAmendments #12 - #16 had slightly different testing than those enrolled under \nprotocol Amendment #17 or later; see Section 5.5 and 5.6.\nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 39 of 77\nBaseline: For baseline, percentage of patients falling into each category of the \nexamination status (normal, abnormal: not reported, abnormal: mild, abnormal: \nmoderate, abnormal: severe, not done, not reported) will be summarized for each \neye structure by eye and for the overall across eyes.  \u201cAbnormal: Not Reported\u201d \nincludes patients who reported \u201cabnormal\u201d results but with missing severity.  \n\u201cNot Done\u201d includes patients who marked the \u201cNot done\u201d check box on the CRF \npage for the exam.  \u201cNot Reported\u201d includes patients for which the CRF page was \ncompleted but there are missing results for the specific summary.  For the overall \nsummary, patients are counted once in the worst category across both eyes at \nbaseline.\nWorst Change from Baseline: For post-baseline results, percentage of patients \nfalling into each category of the worst examination status on study (new \nfinding/worsening of findings, no change, improvement of findings, not done) \nwill be summarized for each eye structure by eye and for the overall across eyes.  \nFor the total summary, patients are counted once in the worst category across both \neyes on study. \n\uf0b7\nBiomicroscopy (Slit Lamp) Examination Results\nSummaries will be provided separately for each item on the CRF applicable for \nthe group of patients included in the summary.  Patients enrolled under protocol \nAmendments #12 - #16 had slightly different testing than those enrolled under \nprotocol Amendment #17 or later; see Section 5.5 and 5.6.\nBaseline: For the baseline, percentage of patients falling into each category of the \nexamination status (normal, abnormal: not reported, abnormal: mild, abnormal: \nmoderate or abnormal: severe, not done, not reported) will be summarized for \neach eye structure by eye and for the total across eyes.  For the overall summary, \npatients are counted once in the worst category across both eyes at baseline.\nWorst Change from Baseline: For post-baseline results, percentage of patients \nfalling into each category of the worst examination status on study (new \nfinding/worsening of findings, no change, improvement of findings, not done) \nwill be summarized for each eye structure by eye and for the overall across eyes.  \nFor the overall summary, patients are counted once in the worst category across \nboth eyes on study. \n\uf0b7\nOcular Characteristics\nBaseline: The number and the percentage of patients in each group of iris color \nwill be calculated for each eye.  In addition, whether or not a patient has nevi or \nfreckles on the iris (yes/no/not reported) and separately on the conjunctiva bulbi \n(yes/no/not reported) will be summarized.\nChange from Baseline: The change from baseline in ocular characteristics will \nbe presented by eye and for the total across eyes.  Patients are counted once in \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 40 of 77\neach category if there is a change in: eye color, nevi or freckles (on iris), and nevi \nor freckles (on conjunctiva bulbi).  For the overall summary, patients are counted \nonce if there is a change in either eye in the aforementioned categories.  Patients \nare counted as having a change in nevi or freckles if \u201cNo\u201d was reported at \nbaseline and \u201cYes\u201d was reported at a subsequent visit during the study.\n8.2.2.9. Expanded Ophthalmologic Testing (Protocol Amendment #17 \u2013 NSCLC \nPatients)\nThe discussion in this section pertains to analyses performed using the NSCLC \nDetailed Ophthalmologic analysis datasets described in Section 5.6.  As noted above, \nreports concentrating on individual cohorts may summarize the ophthalmologic data \nbased on the cohort-specific safety population and the summaries may deviate from \nthose described below.\nThis version of the SAP describes the analyses planned for the resubmission of the \nA8081001 Ophthalmology Report.  The original ophthalmology report (19Jun2014) \nincluded fewer than 30 patients who had completed all 10 tests, and the FDA \nrequested a resubmission including results for at least 30 patients who had complete \ndata.  Version 5 of the Statistical Analysis Plan (12Apr2014) described the analyses \nfor the original report.\nNote that all NSCLC patients enrolled after protocol Amendment #17 approval will \nundergo the following expanded set of 10 ophthalmology assessments: BCVA, \nrefractive error associated with BCVA, pupil size/symmetry under standardized \nlighting conditions, slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, intraocular \ninflammation (cell count and aqueous flare), IOP, fundoscopy, dilated fundus \nphotography, OCT, and ocular characteristics.  These tests are to be performed at \nscreening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, and 2-8 weeks after the last dose of study \nmedication (EOT); at protocol Amendment #20, annual examinations following \nCycle 3 Day 1 until EOT were added to the schedule.  Patients enrolled after approval \nof protocol Amendment #22 were no longer required to undergo the expanded testing, \nas described in Section 5.6.\nA total of at least 30 NSCLC patients are required to complete all examinations \nthrough Cycle 3, Day 1.  Due to patient inability/unwillingness to submit to the EOT \ntesting, it may be impractical to achieve a sample size of 30 at later timepoints.  In \norder to adequately describe the data available at the time of reporting, the following \nanalyses will be repeated for the populations described in Section 5.6 unless \notherwise specified: NSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam - ITT Population and \nNSCLC Detailed Ophthalmologic Exam All 10 Tests \u2013 Evaluable Population. \nGiven that NSCLC patients enrolled under protocol Amendment #17 and beyond \ninclude patients with a variety of molecular markers, summaries will also be \npresented overall and across cohorts: ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort, \nMET-amplified NSCLC cohort, ALK-negative NSCLC cohort #2, Rifampin \nsub-study (if NSCLC), and Enriched Other NSCLC cohort (as applicable).  \nAdditional summaries may be presented for separate cohorts. \nProtocol A8081001\nStatistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0\nThis Document is Company Confidential \nPage 41 of 77\nThe following tests of continuous measures will be summarized separately for right \nand left eyes: refractive error (spherical equivalent), intraocular pressure, optical \ncoherence tomography (center point), and external eye exam (pupillary \ndiameter/symmetry).

The initial design of the study focused on determining the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose, and recommended dose for Phase 2 studies (RP2D) for PF-02341066 administered twice a day (BID).  Assessments of evidence of antitumor activity were also included. The study includes a standard 3 + 3 design 1 for dose escalation component in patients with advanced, solid tumors refractory to standard therapy.  Patients are enrolled in cohorts of three patients. The dose escalation component is followed by further evaluation of the RP2D in 2 cohorts.  The first RP2D cohort evaluates the potential for CYP3A inhibition due to PF-02341066 using midazolam (MDZ) as a probe.  The second RP2D cohort is composed of an enriched population and includes molecularly-defined groups of patients who are predicted to have a clinical response to PF-02341066:\u2022ALK-positive NSCLC cohortCCIProtocol A8081001Statistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0This Document is Company Confidential Page 11 of 77\uf0b7MET amplified NSCLC cohort\uf0b7ROS1 marker positive NSCLC cohort\uf0b7Enriched Other cohort, including NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations (see below)In addition, 2 ALK-negative NSCLC cohorts are evaluated at the RP2D.  A further dose escalation cohort was added to evaluate PF-02341066 administered once a day (QD).  Also, 2 drug-drug interaction (DDI) sub-studies were added to assess the effect of the co-administration of rifampin, and separately of itraconazole, on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 BID. Although patients are enrolled in a single cohort/sub-study, some analyses (eg, analyses of ophthalmic data and analyses of hypogonadism data) are based on groups of patients who are drawn from multiple cohort/sub-study enrollments.  Additionally, patients enrolled in one cohort may also be analyzed with patients in another cohort based on the tumor markers present. Patients who enroll in the Enriched Other cohort may well be a very diverse group, including patients who are positive for ALK chromosomal translocation (except for patients with NSCLC) or ALK gene amplification; or positive for known MET kinase domain activating mutations; or having chromosomal translocations/ fusions that lead to altered transcriptional regulation of MET and/or HGF; or positive for chromosomal translocations at the ROS1 gene in other cancer types besides NCSLC; or NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations.  In this version of the SAP, references to handling of data pertaining to the Enriched Other cohort should in general be understood to pertain to appropriately-defined subgroups of the Enriched cohort.  Such subgroups will be defined when there are a sufficient number of patients who can be meaningfully combined based on their tumors and tumor profiles.  At this time only the MET Exon 14 alteration subgroup has been identified for specific consideration in the Enriched Other cohort.Note the aforementioned groups are further defined in Appendix 1.",

                        "Content": " The RP2D Enriched Other cohort includes all patients in RP2D who do not belong to one of the previously defined cohorts.  This enriched population will be used to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with other molecular profiles that confer sensitivity to PF-02341066, in particular, patients who are positive for ALK chromosomal translocation (except for patients with NSCLC) or ALK gene amplification; who are positive for known MET kinase domain activating mutations; who have chromosomal translocations/ fusions that lead to altered transcriptional regulation of MET and/or HGF; or are positive for chromosomal translocations at the ROS1 gene in other cancer types besides NCSLC; or NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations.  The sample size of the Enriched Other cohort will be dependent upon the number of enrolled patients meeting the criteria for this cohort; however it is anticipated that approximately 171patients will be enrolled.  RECIST version 1.0 is used to assess tumor activity in this cohort. In NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations, an ORR of 10% is considered to be uninteresting for further study for this group with 30% considered interesting for further exploration.  With 33 evaluable patients, there is at least 90% power to test the null hypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal to 0.10 versus the alternative hypothesis that it is greater than 0.10 assuming an alternative target rate of 0.30 with a one-sided \u03b1=0.05 based on a single stage design using exact test.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if \u2265 7 objective responses are observed among the first 33 evaluable patients.  As of data cutoff date 01 August 2016, 11 confirmed objective responses (CR, PR) were observed in a total of 28 response-evaluable patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  Based on the number of confirmed objective responses observed, the null hypothesis was rejected. The proportion of responders will be estimated with better precision if the number of evaluable patients exceeds 33 patients.1.As of Amendment 23 (21 February 2017), the sample size in the Enriched Other cohort was further increased to a total of 130 patients, including approximately 50 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  In addition, a separate subgroup of approximately 5 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was planned to be enrolled in clinical sites in Japan.  2.As of the PACL issued 15 May 2017, further enrollment of NSCLC patients into the MET intermediate amplification group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment slots were transferred to the Enriched Other cohort to facilitate further enrollment of patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a result, the total enrollment for patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was increased to 68 patients (50 patients + 13 transferred slots + 5 Japanese patients). 3.As of the PACL issued 07 December 2017, sites were allowed to enroll an additional 13 patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC into the Enriched Other cohort.  These patients were originally slotted for the broader Enriched Other cohort and Protocol A8081001Statistical Analysis Plan: Final v10.0This Document is Company Confidential Page 17 of 77were now assigned specifically to patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC.  As a result, the total enrollment of the Enriched Other cohort subset of patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC increased to 81 patients (68 [defined in point 2 above] + 13 patients).  4.As of the PACL issued 11 September 2018, further enrollment of NSCLC patients into the MET high amplification group was closed and the remaining 14 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC subgroup within the Enriched Other cohort. As a result, the total enrollment for patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was increased to 103 patients (81 [defined in point 3 above] +14+8 [additional slots that were allowed without exceeding the total overall study enrollment of approximately 600 patients]).5.As of the Investigator Communication Letter dated January 7, 2019, further enrollment of NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations was closed.",

Within each patient group, survival follow-up will continue until 1 year after the last patient\u2019s last dose.  As of protocol Amendment #23, survival follow-up was extended for ROS1 marker positive NSCLC patients, NSCLC patients with tumors haboring MET gene amplification, and MET Exon 14 alterations to 2 years after the last patient in each of these cohorts has discontinued PF-02341066 treatment.Response will be derived based on the investigator assessment according to the rules described in Appendices 5 and 6 of the Supplemental SAP for the following groups: ",
