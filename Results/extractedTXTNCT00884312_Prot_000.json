Only subjects who have adequately completed a \nprior carfilzomib study will be eligible for the current study.\nSafety endpoints will consist of the following: (1) all reported \nGrades 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), (2) all reported peripheral \nneuropathy AEs (Grades 1\u20134), (3) all serious adverse events (SAEs), \nand (4) Grades 1\u20134 AEs leading to either a missed carfilzomib dose, \ncarfilzomib dose reduction, or discontinuation.  In the event of a \ntoxicity leading to a dose reduction or discontinuation, pertinent \nlaboratory measurements and concomitant medications will be \ncollected and monitored as unscheduled visits.\nEfficacy endpoints will include time to tumor progression (TTP), \nprogression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).  Data on \nthe first subsequent treatment regimen following carfilzomib study \ndiscontinuation will also be collected.\nSTUDY \nPOPULATION\nApproximately 100 subjects from approximately 50 sites in the United \nStates and Canada will be eligible for participation in the extended \ncarfilzomib therapy study.  Additional subjects may be enrolled \nshould the number of eligible subjects exceed 100.\nINCLUSION \nCRITERIA\nSubjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible \nto enroll in this study:\nDisease Related\n1. Previous completion of a carfilzomib study within 90 days prior to \nfirst dose of study drug for Protocol PX-171-010.\n2. Disease Assessments performed within 30 days prior to first dose \nof study drug for Protocol PX-171-010.\nEthical/Other\n3. Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and \ninstitutional guidelines.\n4. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative \nserum or urine pregnancy test, with a sensitivity of at least \n50 mIU/mL, within 3 days prior to first dose of study drug for \nProtocol PX-171-010.\nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 11 of 60\nConfidential\n5. Subjects must agree to adhere to the study visit schedule and other \nstudy requirements and receive outpatient treatment and \nlaboratory monitoring at the institution that administers the drug.\nEXCLUSION \nCRITERIA\nSubjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not \neligible to be enrolled in this study:\nDisease Related\n1. Administration of an intervening chemotherapy between the time \nof previous carfilzomib study termination and first dose of study \ndrug for Protocol PX-171-010.\nConcurrent Conditions\n2. Pregnant or lactating females.\n3. Diagnosis of a new malignancy of a different tumor type.\nPROCEDURES\nAfter screening, eligibility determination, and enrollment; subjects \nwill receive carfilzomib according to the doses and schedules as \nsummarized in the Study Treatment section of the Synopsis.  Standard \nmonitoring for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity is outlined \nin Section 6.2.  Subjects may continue carfilzomib treatment until \ndisease progression and discussion with Onyx Medical Monitor,\ndiagnosis of new malignancy, unacceptable toxicity, Investigator \ndiscretion, voluntary withdrawal, or commercial availability of \ncarfilzomib.\nSafety Measures. A complete blood count (CBC) including platelets \nand basic metabolic chemistry panel (eg, Chem 7 or 8) will be \nperformed on Day 1 of each cycle.  Other general safety monitoring \n(eg, physical examinations, imaging, specialty tests, etc.) shall be in \naccordance with institutional guidelines and as clinically indicated. \nThese data will not be routinely collected.\nEfficacy Measures. Tumor measurements and efficacy assessments \nwill be in accordance with the methods employed in the subject\u2019s \nprior carfilzomib study.  For subjects participating in a carfilzomib \ntrial without prior tumor measurements and efficacy assessments \n(eg, PX-171-008), tumor assessments employing standard institutional \nmethods will be conducted at the time of screening for the current \nstudy.  Disease assessments (eg, extent of disease measurements and \nobjective response category) will occur within 30 days prior to \nenrollment to determine eligibility, at least every 3 months throughout \nstudy participation, and at end of study.  Refer to Appendix D\u2013E for \nResponse Criteria.\nFor subjects with multiple myeloma (MM) entering the extended\nstudy with a partial response (PR), minimal response (MR), or stable \ndisease (SD); bone marrow biopsies for cytogenetic and fluorescence \nin situ hybridization (FISH) evaluation will be optional at screening.  \nA bone marrow biopsy in these subjects will also be optional at end of \nstudy for cytogenetic and FISH evaluation if the reason for study \nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 12 of 60\nConfidential\ndiscontinuation is disease progression.  For subjects with MM \nentering the extended study with stringent complete response (sCR), \ncomplete response (CR), or very good partial response (VGPR), a \nbone marrow biopsy for cytogenetic and FISH analyses will also be \noptional upon the establishment of disease progression.\nSTUDY \nTREATMENT\nCarfilzomib will be administered intravenously (IV), using the same \nmethod, dose level and frequency as administered in the last cycle of \nthe subject\u2019s previous carfilzomib study; carfilzomib doses will be \nadministered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle (or the \nsame dose level and frequency as administered at the last visit of the \nprior carfilzomib study) until disease progression and discussion with \nthe Onyx Medical Monitor, diagnosis of new malignancy, \nunacceptable toxicity, Investigator discretion, voluntary withdrawal, \nor commercial availability of carfilzomib.  Each dose will consist of \nCarfilzomib for Injection administered on a mg/m2 basis.  Subjects \nwith a body surface area (BSA) > 2.2 m2 will receive a dose based \nupon a 2.2 m2 BSA.  Dosing will be continued or modified based \nupon clinical and laboratory findings.\nDecreased carfilzomib dosing frequency to include dosing on Days 1, \n2, 15 and 16 (eg, every other week dosing schedule), will be permitted \nat the discretion of the Investigator; the Onyx Therapeutics Medical \nMonitor may be consulted as needed. Carfilzomib dose reductions for \ntoxicity, to a minimum dose of 11 mg/m2, will be permitted following \ndiscussion with the Medical Monitor, as needed.  Missed doses of \ncarfilzomib will not be made up.\nDose escalations above the original dose level are permitted.  \nFor subjects with evidence of disease progression, the Onyx Medical \nMonitor must be consulted prior to the dose escalation or termination \nfrom study.\nAcyclovir or valacyclovir should be given to all subjects with a \nhistory of herpes simplex or zoster, per institutional prophylaxis \nguidelines, unless contraindicated.\nPRIMARY \nENDPOINT\n\uf0b7Safety\nSECONDARY \nENDPOINTS\n\uf0b7Overall Survival (OS)\n\uf0b7Progression Free Survival (PFS)\n\uf0b7Time to Progression (TTP)\nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 13 of 60\nConfidential\nSTATISTICAL \nMETHODS\nSafety Analyses:  Safety data analysis will be conducted on all \nsubjects receiving at least 1 dose of study treatment.

Carfilzomib is structurally \nand mechanistically different from the dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor \nbortezomib, which is currently approved for use in the treatment of patients with multiple \nmyeloma (Demo 2005, Velcade 2008).  In preclinical studies, carfilzomib demonstrates \npotent anti-tumor activity in a variety of tumor models, including multiple myeloma (MM)\n(Demo 2007, Ivancsits 2006, Kuhn 2007).\n1.2\nPHASE 1 AND 2 EXPERIENCE WITH CARFILZOMIB IN \nHEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES (Carfilzomib IB 2010, Stewart 2007, \nOnyx Data on File)\nPhase 1 clinical trials of carfilzomib have been conducted in subjects with hematological \ntumors, including MM, Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \n(NHL), and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.  In a completed study (PX-171-001), carfilzomib dosing \nranged from 1.2 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days (QDx5) followed by \n9 days\u2019 rest, in cycles repeated every 14 days.  Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) associated \nwith the highest dose (20 mg/m2) were Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and Grade 3 febrile \nneutropenia, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 15 mg/m2.\nIn a completed Phase 1 Study PX-171-002, doses ranging from 1.2 mg/m2 to 27 mg/m2 are \nadministered on consecutive day dosing (QDx2) twice weekly for 3 weeks, followed by \n12 days rest, in cycles repeated every 28 days.  DLTs observed at the highest dose \n(27 mg/m2) included thrombocytopenia and hypoxia, therefore the MTD was established at \n20 mg/m2.  Observations of fever, chills, and rigors, and an elevated creatinine (Grade 2) \nobserved on Day 2 of the 27 mg/m2 cohort prior to dosing in this part of the study, led to the \ndevelopment of a stepped-up dosing regimen wherein carfilzomib administration is initiated \nwith a dose at 20 mg/m2 followed by escalation to 27 mg/m2 after the first cycle.\nThe most common non-hematologic toxicity events reported from the Phase 1 studies are \ngenerally mild, low-grade nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, headache, and constipation.  A Grade 3 \nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 15 of 60\nConfidential\nor 4\u2013thrombocytopenia may occur in subjects with preexisting low platelets, with recovery \noccurring between treatments.  Grade 3 or higher neutropenia and anemia have also been \nreported, but less frequently than thrombocytopenia.\nObjective responses including partial responses (PRs) (50%\u201390% decreases in M-protein) \nand minimal responses (MRs) (25%\u201349% decreases in M-protein) were seen in several \nsubjects with plasma cell dyscrasias in both studies.  The responses have been durable with \nPRs on average of 9 months.  In addition, both MM and NHL subjects have had stable \ndisease (SD), exceeding 1 year in some cases.  Carfilzomib has also shown activity against \nrefractory MM, solid tumors, and 1 mantle cell lymphoma subject with gastrointestinal \nlymphoma involvement that achieved an unconfirmed complete response (CRu).\nThe use of carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is being \nevaluated in a Phase 1b dose escalation Study PX-171-006 in relapsed MM subjects.  \nThe study will evaluate the MTD of this combination regimen.\nTwo Phase 2 studies are ongoing, one for relapsed refractory MM and another in MM \nsubjects relapsed following 1\u20133 prior therapies.  In these studies, tumor lysis syndrome \n(TLS) has been observed in 4 of 77 subjects treated at the 20 mg/m2 dose.  Guidelines for the \ninvestigator were subsequently implemented for the prevention and management of TLS in \nongoing studies.\nIn May 2009, a MM arm was added to the PX-171-007 study to explore carfilzomib given as \na 30-minute infusion.  MM subjects receiving carfilzomib administered over 30 minutes have \ndose escalated to 20/36 mg/m2 (4 subjects) and 20/45 mg/m2 (3 subjects) without \ndose-limiting toxicities.\n1.3\nPHASE 1 AND 2 EXPERIENCE WITH CARFILZOMIB IN SOLID \nTUMORS (Carfilzomib IB 2010, Stewart 2007, Onyx Data on File)\nCarfilzomib is also being studied as a single agent in a Phase 1b/2 Study PX-171-007 in \nadvanced stage solid tumor subjects who have failed available therapies. Subjects are treated \nwith carfilzomib on the QDx2 schedules using the stepped-up dosing regimen previously \ndescribed.  A Phase 1b dose escalation portion has been completed, demonstrating that \nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 16 of 60\nConfidential\nadministration of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1and 2 followed by 36 mg/m2 on subsequent days is \nwell tolerated.\nA Simon 2-stage open label study of 70 patients with 5 cohorts was initiated as the Phase 2 \nportion in April 2008.  The cohorts were stratified according to solid tumor disease type.  \nThe objective of this portion of the trial was to estimate overall response to 4 cycles of \ncarfilzomib.  This portion would only proceed to stage 2 if 1 PR or better occurred after \n16 weeks in a cohort.\nSeventy-nine patients had been enrolled on study through May 2009 in the Phase 1 \n(14 patients) and Phase 2 (65 patients) parts.  The median number of carfilzomib cycles given \nwas 2 (range 1-12). Of the 1064 doses administered ~68% were at the 36 mg/m2 dose level.  \nOne PR was observed in a renal cell patient; 11 patients achieved stable disease.  The most \ncommon AEs included fatigue, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and constipation.  There was a \nlow incidence of peripheral neuropathy and severe hematologic toxicity.\nDose escalation to evaluate and determine an MTD with a 30-minute infusion of carfilzomib \nis ongoing in patients with solid tumors and multiple myeloma. At this time, there is limited \nsafety data available to comment on differences, if any, associated with a 30-minute infusion \nversus a 10-minute infusion of carfilzomib.\nA drug-drug interaction Study PX-171-008 has been initiated where 15 subjects with \nadvanced solid tumors will be assessed to determine the effect of carfilzomib on the \npharmacokinetics of midazolam, a sensitive substrate for human CYP3A4. In addition, renal \nand biliary excretions will be assessed in this study.\nThe safety data from the solid tumor study indicate that the non-hematologic toxicities are \nsimilar to those seen in the Phase 1 studies.  The most common events reported regardless of \nrelationship to study drug are fatigue, diarrhea, and headache.\nFurther information about the Phase 1 and 2 studies is presented in the Investigator\u2019s \nBrochure (IB).\nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 17 of 60\nConfidential\n1.4\nEXTENDED CARFILZOMIB TREATMENT STUDY RATIONALE\nFor all of the aforementioned primary carfilzomib treatment studies, the maximum duration \nof treatment ranges from 1 to 18 cycles.  The purpose of the extended carfilzomib treatment \nstudy is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term carfilzomib treatment for patients \nwho have completed a carfilzomib study.\n1.5\nDOSE RATIONALE\nCarfilzomib will be administered intravenously (IV) using the same method, dose level and \nfrequency as administered in the last cycle of the subject\u2019s previous carfilzomib study.  \nA carfilzomib dosing schedule on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle (or the same \ndose level and frequency as administered at the last visit of the prior carfilzomib study) will \nbe employed and evaluated for long-term safety and efficacy.  Subjects will remain at the \nsame dose level and frequency as their previous study because the dose has been shown to be \ntolerable in the individual subject.\nThe option will be available to reduce the dosing frequency to Days 1, 2, 15, and 16 of a \n28-day cycle (eg, twice a week, every other week).  Reductions in dosing frequency will be \nmade at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.\nDose escalations beyond the original dose level up to the maximum tolerated dose \nestablished in primary carfilzomib studies may be permitted following discussion with the \nMedical Monitor for subjects whose disease progresses on the extended carfilzomib \ntreatment regimen.\nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 18 of 60\nConfidential\n2\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES\n2.1\nOBJECTIVE\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term or continuing carfilzomib dosing in subjects \nwho have completed a previous carfilzomib treatment study.\n3\nEXPERIMENTAL PLAN\n3.1\nSTUDY DESIGN\nThis is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study of carfilzomib to monitor the safety and \nefficacy of long-term or continuing carfilzomib therapy for subjects who previously \ncompleted a primary carfilzomib treatment study.  Only subjects who have completed a prior \ncarfilzomib treatment study will be eligible for the current study.\nSafety endpoints will consist of the following: (1) all reported Grades 3 and 4 adverse events \n(AEs), (2) all reported peripheral neuropathy AEs (Grades 1\u20134), (3) all serious adverse \nevents (SAEs), and (4) Grades 1\u20134 AEs leading to either a missed carfilzomib dose, \ncarfilzomib dose reduction, or discontinuation.  In the event of a toxicity leading to a dose \nreduction or discontinuation, pertinent laboratory measurements and concomitant \nmedications will be collected and monitored as unscheduled visits.\nEfficacy endpoints will include time to tumor progression (TTP), progression-free survival \n(PFS), and overall survival (OS).  Data on the first subsequent treatment regimen following \nextended carfilzomib therapy study discontinuation will also be collected.\n3.2\nNUMBER OF CENTERS\nApproximately 50 study centers in the United States (US) and Canada will be eligible for \nparticipation in the current study.

It is \nrecommended that electrolyte abnormalities judged as clinically significant by the Principal \nInvestigator (or qualified designee) be corrected to \u2264 Grade 1 or baseline.  Renal function and \nserum creatinine should be monitored prior to dosing.  Carfilzomib must be held if a subject \npresents with a CrCl < 15 mL/min with the following exception:  for subjects with CrCl \n<15 mL/min at study entry, study drug must be held if CrCl drops \u2265 50% from baseline. \nSubjects who develop an active infection requiring systemic treatment should not be dosed \nwith carfilzomib until the infection has resolved and the treatment course has been \ncompleted.  Subjects with \u2265 Grade 3 neutropenia should not be treated with carfilzomib.\nCarfilzomib dosing must be held for Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with bleeding.  If platelet \ncounts do not recover, the dose of carfilzomib may be reduced or held according to the Dose \nReductions/Adjustments rules outlined in Section 6.2.2.  For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia \nwithout evidence of active bleeding, platelet transfusions may be used per study site policies \nand at the discretion of the Investigator or treating physician.\nCarfilzomib treatment can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation, sometimes \nrequiring the use of antiemetics or antidiarrheals.

Samples for cytogenetic and FISH analysis will also be optional for \nall MM subjects who discontinue study due to PD.  Bone marrow cytogenetic and FISH \nanalyses will be carried out at the site\u2019s local laboratory, per standard of practice, or in a \nCentral Reference Laboratory.\n8\nSTUDY DISCONTINUATION\nSubjects may withdraw from the study at any time.  Subjects who discontinue from the study \nwill be monitored for AEs as described in Appendix C (NCI-CTCAE Version 3.0).\nThe Sponsor, Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. may elect to discontinue the study at any time.\nThe Investigator may remove a subject from the study for the following reasons:\n\uf0b7\nNoncompliance with study procedures\n\uf0b7\nNeed of treatment with medications not allowed by the study protocol\n\uf0b7\nSubject no longer consents to participate in the study\n\uf0b7\nIntercurrent illness that interferes with study assessments\n\uf0b7\nIncidence or severity of AEs in this study indicates a potential health hazard to\nthe subject\n\uf0b7\nConfirmation of PD, and discussion with the Medical Monitor\nOnyx Therapeutics or designee must be notified within 24 hours if a subject is withdrawn \nfrom the study.\nIf the reason for withdrawal is the occurrence of an AE, the subject will be followed by the \nInvestigator until such events resolve, stabilize, and, according to the Investigator\u2019s \njudgment, there is no need of further follow-up.  The reason for withdrawal from the study \nwill be documented in the CRF.\nIf a subject is withdrawn for PD, the date of the laboratory test or procedure indicating \ndisease progression will be used as the date of PD.  The CRFs must have appropriate source \nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 34 of 60\nConfidential\ndocumentation to demonstrate that a subject has progressed.  Bone marrow aspirate or biopsy \nsamples for cytogenetic analysis are optional for all MM subjects who discontinue due to PD.\n9\nADVERSE EVENTS\n9.1\nADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITIONS\nAn AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered an investigational \nproduct and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.\nAn unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity of which is not \nconsistent with the current Investigator\u2019s Brochure or prescribing information for a marketed \ncompound. Also, reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a \nknown, already documented AE constitute unexpected AEs. For example, an event more \nspecific or more severe than described in the Investigator\u2019s Brochure would be considered \n\u201cunexpected\u201d.\nAn AE therefore can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laboratory finding), \nsymptom, or disease temporally associated with participation in an investigational study, \nwhether or not considered treatment-related.  In addition to new events, any increase in the \nseverity or frequency of a pre-existing condition that occurs after the subject signs a consent \nform for participation is considered an AE.  This includes any side effect, injury, toxicity, or \nsensitivity reaction.\nWhenever possible, the CTCAE Version 3.0 (see Appendix D) should be used to describe the \nevent and for assessing the severity of AEs.  Any event representing a change in the CTCAE \ngrade needs to be reported on the AE CRF.  This includes any change in a laboratory value.\nFor AEs not adequately addressed in the CTCAE, the severity table below may be used:\n",

Subjects must agree to adhere to the study visit schedule and other \nstudy requirements and receive outpatient treatment and \nlaboratory monitoring at the institution that administers the drug.\nEXCLUSION \nCRITERIA\nSubjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not \neligible to be enrolled in this study:\nDisease Related\n1. Administration of an intervening chemotherapy between the time \nof previous carfilzomib study termination and first dose of study \ndrug for Protocol PX-171-010.\nConcurrent Conditions\n2. Pregnant or lactating females.\n3. Diagnosis of a new malignancy of a different tumor type.\nPROCEDURES\nAfter screening, eligibility determination, and enrollment; subjects \nwill receive carfilzomib according to the doses and schedules as \nsummarized in the Study Treatment section of the Synopsis.  Standard \nmonitoring for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity is outlined \nin Section 6.2.  Subjects may continue carfilzomib treatment until \ndisease progression and discussion with Onyx Medical Monitor,\ndiagnosis of new malignancy, unacceptable toxicity, Investigator \ndiscretion, voluntary withdrawal, or commercial availability of \ncarfilzomib.\nSafety Measures. A complete blood count (CBC) including platelets \nand basic metabolic chemistry panel (eg, Chem 7 or 8) will be \nperformed on Day 1 of each cycle.  Other general safety monitoring \n(eg, physical examinations, imaging, specialty tests, etc.) shall be in \naccordance with institutional guidelines and as clinically indicated. \nThese data will not be routinely collected.\nEfficacy Measures. Tumor measurements and efficacy assessments \nwill be in accordance with the methods employed in the subject\u2019s \nprior carfilzomib study.  For subjects participating in a carfilzomib \ntrial without prior tumor measurements and efficacy assessments \n(eg, PX-171-008), tumor assessments employing standard institutional \nmethods will be conducted at the time of screening for the current \nstudy.  Disease assessments (eg, extent of disease measurements and \nobjective response category) will occur within 30 days prior to \nenrollment to determine eligibility, at least every 3 months throughout \nstudy participation, and at end of study.  Refer to Appendix D\u2013E for \nResponse Criteria.\nFor subjects with multiple myeloma (MM) entering the extended\nstudy with a partial response (PR), minimal response (MR), or stable \ndisease (SD); bone marrow biopsies for cytogenetic and fluorescence \nin situ hybridization (FISH) evaluation will be optional at screening.  \nA bone marrow biopsy in these subjects will also be optional at end of \nstudy for cytogenetic and FISH evaluation if the reason for study \nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 12 of 60\nConfidential\ndiscontinuation is disease progression.  For subjects with MM \nentering the extended study with stringent complete response (sCR), \ncomplete response (CR), or very good partial response (VGPR), a \nbone marrow biopsy for cytogenetic and FISH analyses will also be \noptional upon the establishment of disease progression.\nSTUDY \nTREATMENT\nCarfilzomib will be administered intravenously (IV), using the same \nmethod, dose level and frequency as administered in the last cycle of \nthe subject\u2019s previous carfilzomib study; carfilzomib doses will be \nadministered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle (or the \nsame dose level and frequency as administered at the last visit of the \nprior carfilzomib study) until disease progression and discussion with \nthe Onyx Medical Monitor, diagnosis of new malignancy, \nunacceptable toxicity, Investigator discretion, voluntary withdrawal, \nor commercial availability of carfilzomib.  Each dose will consist of \nCarfilzomib for Injection administered on a mg/m2 basis.  Subjects \nwith a body surface area (BSA) > 2.2 m2 will receive a dose based \nupon a 2.2 m2 BSA.  Dosing will be continued or modified based \nupon clinical and laboratory findings.\nDecreased carfilzomib dosing frequency to include dosing on Days 1, \n2, 15 and 16 (eg, every other week dosing schedule), will be permitted \nat the discretion of the Investigator; the Onyx Therapeutics Medical \nMonitor may be consulted as needed. Carfilzomib dose reductions for \ntoxicity, to a minimum dose of 11 mg/m2, will be permitted following \ndiscussion with the Medical Monitor, as needed.  Missed doses of \ncarfilzomib will not be made up.\nDose escalations above the original dose level are permitted.  \nFor subjects with evidence of disease progression, the Onyx Medical \nMonitor must be consulted prior to the dose escalation or termination \nfrom study.\nAcyclovir or valacyclovir should be given to all subjects with a \nhistory of herpes simplex or zoster, per institutional prophylaxis \nguidelines, unless contraindicated.\nPRIMARY \nENDPOINT\n\uf0b7Safety\nSECONDARY \nENDPOINTS\n\uf0b7Overall Survival (OS)\n\uf0b7Progression Free Survival (PFS)\n\uf0b7Time to Progression (TTP)\nOnyx Therapeutics, Inc.\nProtocol PX-171-010, Amendment 3\nCarfilzomib for Injection\nPage 13 of 60\nConfidential\nSTATISTICAL \nMETHODS\nSafety Analyses:  Safety data analysis will be conducted on all \nsubjects receiving at least 1 dose of study treatment.  Analyses will \nconsist of data summaries for reported AEs.  The number and \npercentage of subjects experiencing 1 or more AEs will be \nsummarized by dose, relationship to study drug, and severity.\nDisease Response Analyses:  Response to treatment will be tabulated \nusing the criteria employed in the subject\u2019s prior carfilzomib \ntreatment study.\nFor subjects participating in a carfilzomib trial without explicit tumor \nmeasurements and defined response criteria (eg, PX-171-008), \nresponse to treatment will be tabulated using the appropriate method \n(eg, RECIST criteria for solid tumors). Response to treatment will be \nbased on the tumor assessment conducted at the time of screening for \nthe current study.\nThe distribution of subjects by response category will be made by \ndisease cohort.  Time-to-event endpoints will be evaluated with the \nuse of the Kaplan-Meier method and plots will be provided.

The cohorts were stratified according to solid tumor disease type.  \nThe objective of this portion of the trial was to estimate overall response to 4 cycles of \ncarfilzomib.  This portion would only proceed to stage 2 if 1 PR or better occurred after \n16 weeks in a cohort.\nSeventy-nine patients had been enrolled on study through May 2009 in the Phase 1 \n(14 patients) and Phase 2 (65 patients) parts.  The median number of carfilzomib cycles given \nwas 2 (range 1-12). Of the 1064 doses administered ~68% were at the 36 mg/m2 dose level.  \nOne PR was observed in a renal cell patient; 11 patients achieved stable disease.  The most \ncommon AEs included fatigue, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and constipation.  There was a \nlow incidence of peripheral neuropathy and severe hematologic toxicity.\nDose escalation to evaluate and determine an MTD with a 30-minute infusion of carfilzomib \nis ongoing in patients with solid tumors and multiple myeloma. At this time, there is limited \nsafety data available to comment on differences, if any, associated with a 30-minute infusion \nversus a 10-minute infusion of carfilzomib.\nA drug-drug interaction Study PX-171-008 has been initiated where 15 subjects with \nadvanced solid tumors will be assessed to determine the effect of carfilzomib on the \npharmacokinetics of midazolam, a sensitive substrate for human CYP3A4. In addition, renal \nand biliary excretions will be assessed in this study.\nThe safety data from the solid tumor study indicate that the non-hematologic toxicities are \nsimilar to those seen in the Phase 1 studies.  The most common events reported regardless of \nrelationship to study drug are fatigue, diarrhea, and headache.\nFurther information about the Phase 1 and 2 studies is presented in the Investigator\u2019s \nBrochure (IB).\n",
