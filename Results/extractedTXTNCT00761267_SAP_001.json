Other minor changes have been made to bring the SAP in agreement with Protocol Amendment 3.This SAP is an amendment of version 2.0. The changes have been made to bring the SAP in agreement with protocol Amendment 4.  The primary changes for Protocol Amendment 4 allow enrolment of subjects with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis.This SAP is an amendment of version 3.0. The changes have been made to tighten up the definition of the global response endpoint.This SAP is an amendment of version 4.0. The changes have been made to conduct additional analysis with subjects who completed study treatment.This SAP is an amendment of version 5.0. This amendment reflects the changes that were made in protocol amendments 8 and 9, which include expansion of enrolment criteria to include infants (aged 1 month - < 2 years) who do not have microbiologically confirmed Candida but who are at high risk of candidiasis, analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters of polysorbate 80, and addition of an interim analysis.",

        "Content": "Anidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal activity against Candida species. In the United States, anidulafungin is approved for the treatment of candidaemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis). In Canada and Europe, anidulafungin carries a similar indication and is approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia in adult non-neutropenic patients. To date, there are no clinical studies evaluating anidulafungin in paediatric subjects with invasive Candida infection. This study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of anidulafungin in subjects 1 month to <18 years of age with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC). Exposure-response relationships of anidulafungin and polysorbate 80 will also be assessed in a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis.",

(eg, the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic visualization of yeast, hyphae or pseudohyphae from a sample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  Subjects may enroll and initiate study 090177e18f1c6d30\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 13:03 (GMT)Protocol <A8851008> (A885), PF-03910960\nStatistical Analysis Plan\nPage 6\ntreatment prior to culture confirmation of Candida sp. If culture confirmation is not \nobtained, subjects may remain in the study and receive study treatment at the discretion of \nthe investigator. Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study \ntreatment, the subject will be required to return for the 2-week and 6-week follow-up visits.\nIn order to accelerate the availability of PK and safety data in the lowest age group (1 month \nto < 2 years), the study population is broadened only in this age group to include children at \nrisk for invasive candidiasis. Thus, eligibility criteria have been modified in Amendment 9 \nto additionally allow enrollment of infants (aged 1 month - < 2 years) who do not have \nmicrobiologically confirmed Candida but who are at high risk of candidiasis, and for whom \nthe investigator considers antifungal therapy with at least 5 days of IV anidulafungin to be \nappropriate.\nAll subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  On Day 1, subject is to \nreceive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive a \ndaily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day 2 onwards.  Subjects \nwill receive treatment (either solely anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed by oral \nfluconazole) for a minimum duration of 14 days from the time of the last negative culture \n(defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by at least 24 hours, \nfollowing the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptom of \ncandidemia or invasive candidiasis.  \nSubjects without microbiologically confirmed Candida infection will be treated with \nIV anidulafungin at the discretion of the investigator to a maximum of 35 days.  Subjects \nmay be switched to oral fluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after at least \n5 days of IV anidulafungin treatment.  \nIn subjects with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis who require continued \ntreatment beyond the maximum total treatment duration (49 days), this treatment will be \nconsidered outside the context of this clinical trial and study drug will not be supplied by the \nSponsor.  For the purpose of study treatment evaluation, Day 35 (for subjects who require \ncontinued IV treatment) or Day 49 (for subjects who required continued oral therapy) will be \nconsidered the last day of study drug treatment.  These subjects are also required to return for \nthe 2-week and 6-week follow-up visit following the last dose of study drug.\nAt selected investigator sites, anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first \n6 subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age to confirm whether or not the recommended \ndosing regimen contained within the protocol for this age group is appropriate.  \nEfficacy will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and \nmicrobiological response) of success, failure or indeterminate at the EOIVT, EOT, 2-week \nFU and 6-week FU visits. Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed \nat the FU visits. Safety will be evaluated through assessment of adverse events and \nmonitoring of clinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry), temperature, and \nphysical examination results. All subjects will be followed for safety through the 6-week FU \nvisit.\n090177e18f1c6d30\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 13:03 (GMT)\nProtocol <A8851008> (A885), PF-03910960Statistical Analysis PlanPage 7",

The objective will be accomplished by presenting frequencies and percentages of global success for each time point overall and by age category (1 month - <2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 - <18 years). Objective 2: To explore pharmacokinetic parameters of anidulafungin in children aged 1 month to <2 years following IV infusion of anidulafungin (AUC24 and Cmax).This pharmacokinetic objective will be addressed in a separate analysis plan.Objective 3: To explore pharmacokinetic parameters of polysorbate 80 following IV infusion of anidulafungin (area under curve over dosing interval (AUC24) and peak concentration (Cmax).This pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) objective will be addressed in a separate analysis plan.090177e18f1c6d30\\Approved\\Approved On: 09-Aug-2018 13:03 (GMT)Protocol <A8851008> (A885), PF-03910960Statistical Analysis PlanPage 8Objective 4: To explore the exposure-response (safety and efficacy endpoints) relationship of anidulafungin using a nonlinear mixed effects approach as appropriate, including exploring the association between PK-PD index (eg, AUC/MIC) and efficacy endpoints.This pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) objective will be addressed in a separate analysis plan.Objective 5: To assess rates of relapse (recurrence) at the Week 2 and Week 6 FU visits.The objective will be accomplished by presenting the frequencies and percentages of relapse(recurrence) for each follow up visit overall and by age category (1 month - <2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 - <18 years).Objective 6: To assess rates of new infection at the Week 2 and Week 6 FU visits.The objective will be accomplished by presenting the frequencies and percentages of emerging infection for each follow up visit overall and by age category (1 month - <2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 - <18 years).Objective 7: To assess all-cause mortality during study therapy and FU visits.The objective will be accomplished by presenting the proportion of deaths due to all causes for each time point overall and by age category (1 month - <2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 - <18 years) at EOIVT, EOT and 2 week and 6 week follow-up visits.
