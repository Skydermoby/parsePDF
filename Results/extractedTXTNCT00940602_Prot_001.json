                "Title": "Amendment 5",
                "Content": " Amendment rationale At the time of this amendment, 192 patients have been randomized in the study and 175 patients failed screening. The purpose of amendment 5 is to clarify exclusion criteria and provide guidance regarding dose modifications, concomitant medications, and contraception as detailed below. The exclusion criteria and dose modification guidelines were updated to exclude patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C). In addition, guidance on treating patients who develop moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) during the trial and immediate discontinuation if severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome occurs is being provided, in alignment with the Exjade prescribing information. Guidance is included on the use of contraception. Effective contraception is required in alignment with the Exjade prescribing information. Highly effective contraception was inadvertently added to amendment 4 of this protocol. Embryo-fetal development animal studies did not show evidence of teratogenicity and there were no developmental effects noted at doses that were not toxic to the maternal animals. Guidance is updated in this amendment to correct this administrative error. Additional guidance was added regarding treatment discontinuation of patients with creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min or serum creatinine > 2 time the age appropriate ULN, and caution in patients with creatinine clearance between 40 and less than 60 mL/min, in alignment with the Exjade prescribing information. Guidance was added regarding the concomitant administration of deferasirox with compounds metabolized through CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP1A2; and the concomitant use of UGT inducers and bile acid sequestrants in alignment with the Exjade prescribing information. Clarification to the visit schedule, adverse events, and collection and reporting bone marrow assessments was also added. In addition, modification in hematologic improvement analysis was provided for clarification. Changes to the protocol amendment 5 Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. Changes to Protocol Synopsis \u2022 Inclusion/exclusion criteria: Child-Pugh Class B and C were added as hepatic diseases which would prevent study treatment. Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 9 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nChanges to Section 5.1 Inclusion criteria \n\u2022 Contraception requirements were modified to clarify that effective contraception methods \nare required in line with the known safety profile of deferasirox. The Highly effective \nmethods were removed as their addition was an administrative error in the previous \namendment (4). \nChanges to Section 5.2 Exclusion criteria \n\u2022 Child-Pugh Class B and C were added to \u201cSystemic diseases which would prevent study \ntreatment\u201d as hepatic conditions that would prevent study treatment. \nChanges to Section 6.7.1.3 Elevations in serum creatinine \n\u2022 Caution regarding treatment of patients with creatinine clearance between 40 and less than \n60 mL/min, and guidance for discontinuation of study medication in case serum creatinine \nis >2 times the age-appropriate upper limit or if creatinine clearance <40 mL/min, were \nadded. \nChanges to Section 6.7.1.6 Skin Rash \n\u2022 Guidance was included requiring immediate and permanent discontinuation of study drug \nif Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is suspected. Sections 6.7.1.6.1 and 6.7.1.6.2 were added to \nseparate Stevens-Johnson syndrome from other rashes. \nChanges to Section 6.7.1.7 Elevated liver function tests \n\u2022 Title of this section was changed from \u201cElevated liver function tests\u201d to \u201cLiver function \nabnormalities\u201d. \n\u2022 Dose modification rules were added related to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh \nClass B). In the event Child Pugh B criteria are met, study drug dosing will be interrupted. \nIf liver disease prognosis improves, study medication can be introduced at 10 mg/kg/day \nor 50% of the previous dose, whichever is less. At the Investigator\u2019s discretion, the dose \nmay then be increased by 5 mg/kg/day every 2 weeks to a maximum of 50% of the \npatient\u2019s previous dose. \n\u2022 Guidance was included requiring immediate and permanent discontinuation of study drug \nif Child Pugh Class C is suspected. \nSections 6.7.1.8, 6.7.1.9 and 6.7.1.10 added \n\u2022 Guidance was added for dose modifications related to auditory (decreased hearing) and \nocular (lens opacities) disturbances, hypersensitivity reactions, and cytopenias, to reflect \nthe Exjade prescribing information. \nChanges to Section 6.7.4 Other concomitant medications \n\u2022 Section 6.7.4.1 \u201cConcomitant therapy requiring caution and/or action\u201d was added. \n\u2022 Section 6.7.4.1 \u201cThe concomitant administration of deferasirox and vitamin C has not \nbeen formally studied. Doses of vitamin C up to 200 mg/d have not been associated with \nadverse consequences\u201d was moved from Section 6.7.4 to Section 6.7.4.1. \n\u2022 Section 6.7.4.1 \u201cAluminum containing antacid therapies should be avoided because they \nmay bind to deferasirox\u201d was moved from Section 6.7.4 to Section 6.7.4.1. \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 10 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \n\u2022 Section 6.7.4.1 cautions that taking study drug in combination with medications with \nknown ulcerogenic potential may increase the risk of gastrointestinal irritation and \nbleeding. \n\u2022 Section 6.7.4.1 cautions that deferasirox may potentially decrease serum levels of \nsubstances metabolized through CYP3A4 and may increase serum concentrations of \nsubstances metabolized through CYP2C8. \n\u2022 Section 6.7.4.1 cautions that concomitant administration of deferasirox with CYP1A2 \nsubstrates that have a narrow therapeutic index is not recommended. If deferasirox and \ntheophylline are used concomitantly, monitoring or theophylline dose reductions should \nbe considered. \n\u2022 Section 6.7.4.1 cautions that the use of bile acid sequestrants decreases deferasirox \nsystemic exposure. \n\u2022 Section 6.7.4.1 cautions that the use of potent UGT may result in a decrease in deferasirox \nefficacy. \nChanges to Section 6.7.6.1 End of Treatment \n\u2022 Additional reasons for study drug discontinuation were added to align with newly released \neCRF. \nChanges to Section 6.7.6.2 Study evaluation completion \n\u2022 Additional reasons for the end of study evaluation were added to align with newly \nreleased eCRF. \nChanges to Table 7-1 Visit evaluation schedule \n\u2022 A column and footnote were added to the table to show and describe the timing and \nrequirements for the 28-day follow up (Visit 501). Footnotes \u201cb\u201d through \u201cd\u201d were \namended to account for the addition of the visit description. \n\u2022 Evaluation period was altered to show that it begins on visit 502. \n\u2022 Minor change to footnote #4. \u201cHematological response\u201d was changed to \u201chematological \nimprovement\u201d. \n\u2022 Urine pregnancy test was added for women of child bearing potential at the End of \nTreatment visit (777). \nChanges to Section 7.5.1 Adverse events \n\u2022 Clarification was added that MDS is not an adverse event in this study. MDS is a required \ncondition for study entry and disease progression (including MDS progression and \nprogression to AML) is a secondary efficacy endpoint. \nChanges to Section 7.5.5.5 Pregnancy Test \n\u2022 Urine pregnancy testing will be performed locally at the End of Treatment visit and if \nmenses are delayed for more than 7 days in a female patient capable of becoming pregnant. \nChanges to Table 7-2 Laboratory evaluations \n\u2022 Urine pregnancy testing added to table for the End of Treatment visit (777) for female \npatients capable of becoming pregnant. \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 11 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nChanges to Section 7.5.9 Bone marrow biopsy \n\u2022 Title of this section was changed from \u201cBone marrow biopsy\u201d to \u201cBone marrow biopsy or \naspirate\u201d and clarification added regarding bone marrow assessments for Disease \nprogression including MDS progression and progression to AML. \nChanges to Section 10.5.1.1 Secondary efficacy variables and related analyses \n\u2022 Clarification was added that the last pre-treatment hemoglobin value measured prior to the \nfirst dose of study medication will be used as the pre-treatment hemoglobin value (If 2 \npre-treatment Hemoglobin values are available and each is at least 7 days after any \ntransfusion, an average of the 2 values will be used to determine the pre-treatment \nhemoglobin value). \u201cOnly RBC transfusions given for hemoglobin levels of equal to or \nless than 9 g/dL pre-treatment\u201d was changed to \u201call RBC transfusions regardless of pre-\ntransfusion hemoglobin level\u201d will count in the RBC transfusion response evaluation\u201d. \n\u201cOnly the first episode of HI\u201d was changed to \u201call episodes of HI\u201d in the patient will be \nconsidered. \n\u2022 Clarification was added for bone marrow collected by biopsy or aspirate. \nIRB/IEC \nA copy of this amended protocol will be sent to the Institutional Review Board \n(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committee (IECs) and Health Authorities. \nThe changes described in this amended protocol require IRB/IEC approval prior to \nimplementation.

                "Content": " Amendment 4 Amendment rationale The purpose of amendment 4 is to adjust the sample size, statistical analysis, and duration of the study and to add two secondary endpoints. Editorial and administrative changes are being made to ensure consistency and clarity in the protocol as a result of these changes. Since the initiation of this study in November 2009 the enrollment projections of 630 patients could not be met and as of July 2013 only 124 patients were enrolled. A reduction in the sample size to 210, which is based on the enrollment projection until December 2014, will support a timely completion of the study. The sample size of 210 patients does not provide sufficient power for testing statistical hypotheses. The statistical analysis has been revised accordingly to concentrate on evaluating the treatment effect of deferasirox relative to placebo, and the study phase designation has been changed to Phase II. The end of the study is no longer defined by the number of events for the primary endpoint, instead, the study will continue for three years from the date the last patient is enrolled. The individual patient treatment duration of at least three years remains unchanged. Overall survival has been changed from key secondary to secondary endpoint because of the reduction in sample size and statistical power. Two secondary endpoints have been added to assess the efficacy of treatment: \u2022 Hematologic improvement (HI) in terms of erythroid response The International Working Group 2006 (IWG 2006) criteria for hematologic improvement-erythroid (HI-E) as defined by improvement in hemoglobin levels or reduction in transfusion requirement are both particularly relevant in transfusion-dependent patients with MDS (Cheson 2006). \u2022 Frequency and rate of infections requiring intravenous (IV) antimicrobials Infections are recognized as a cause of morbidity and mortality in MDS patients and the reduction of infections which require intravenous antimicrobials is therefore of relevance for those patients (Dayyani 2010). Iron availability is known to be essential for proliferation of microbes and the development of infections (Schaible 2004). The effect of chelation therapy or placebo on the frequency of infections requiring IV antimicrobials will be evaluated. As of July 2013, 124 patients had been enrolled in the study. Data will be available to support the analysis of the additional secondary endpoints for patients enrolled prior to the implementation of amendment 4. Upon approval of the amendment, patients will sign a new consent form and continue the appropriate visit schedule. Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 13 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nChanges to the protocol amendment 4 \nChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the \nprotocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. \nChanges to Protocol Synopsis \n\u2022 Study phase: The study phase was changed from phase III to phase II. \n\u2022 Purpose/rationale: The purpose of the study was changed to evaluate clinical benefit \ninstead of demonstrating superiority. \n\u2022 Objectives: The primary objective was changed from statistical comparison to descriptive \nevaluation of the effect of deferasirox and placebo with regard to event-free survival. \nOverall survival was changed from key secondary to secondary endpoint. Hematological \nfunction expressed in transfusion requirements was incorporated in the added hematologic \nimprovement endpoint based on IWG criteria. MDS progression and progression to AML \nwas renamed to disease progression. Frequency of infections requiring IV antimicrobials \nwas added. \n\u2022 Endpoints (efficacy, safety): Overall survival was changed from key secondary to \nsecondary endpoint. Hematological function expressed in frequency/total amount of blood \ntransfusions was incorporated in the added endpoint of proportion of patients with \nhematologic improvement. Time to MDS progression and progression to AML was \nrenamed to time to disease progression. Frequency and rate of infections requiring IV \nantimicrobials was added. \n\u2022 Study design: Interim analyses were removed. The recruitment period was updated from a \nduration of 24 months to completion of recruitment in December 2014. The duration of \nstudy is no longer events driven. The study will be completed 3 years after the last patient \nis enrolled. \n\u2022 Population: The number of patients to be enrolled has been changed to at least 210. \n\u2022 Efficacy evaluation(s): Hematologic improvement was added to be evaluated. \n\u2022 DMC: Text related to the conduct of the interim analyses has been removed as well as the \npossibility to prematurely stop the study for evidence of a favorable risk/benefit \nrelationship of deferasirox compared to placebo. \n\u2022 Statistical methods and data analysis: As there will be no key secondary endpoint, the \nanalysis done for the per protocol analysis set was removed. The description related to the \nsignificance level and control of the overall type I error was removed as was any mention \nof the interim analyses. The confirmatory significance test was removed.

In addition, sites are required to update and submit for approval a revised \nInformed Consent that takes into account the changes described in this amended protocol. \nAmendment 3 \nAmendment rationale \nThe purpose of amendment 3 is to modify some of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, to \nmodify the liver function component of the composite endpoint, to incorporate the specific \nwording regarding the sponsor standard Interactive Response Technology (IRT) eligibility \ncriteria, and to correct typographical errors and inconsistencies. \nThe inclusion/exclusion criteria are being modified to address the most common reasons for \nthe 60% screen failure rate observed among patients that are being screened for the study and \nare in alignment with the study steering committee discussions. This would also allow MDS \npatients that are more commonly seen in the real-world setting as described by the \ninvestigators to be enrolled, hence allowing more patients to participate in the study. The \nupper limit of serum ferritin inclusion criterion is being removed so that patients qualify for \ninclusion if their serum ferritin is >1000 mcg/L. The liver transaminases ALT/AST exclusion \ncriterion is being changed from >2.5 x ULN at screening to ALT/AST > 3.5 x ULN at \nscreening. The bilirubin exclusion criterion is being changed from total bilirubin > ULN at \nscreening to total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN at screening. The serum creatinine exclusion criterion \nis being changed from serum creatinine > 1.2 x ULN at screening to serum creatinine > 1.5 x \nULN at screening. \nThe change in ALT/AST exclusion criterion is supported by an analysis of pooled data from \nMDS patients enrolled in four studies (Studies A0108 A2204 A2409 US02) that show that \npatients with elevated ALT values up to and including 3.5 X ULN at study entry were not at \nhigher risk of notable ALT increase when treated with deferasirox. The shift table below \nshows that only 1 out of 38 (2.6%) treated patients who had baseline ALT >ULN and \u22643.5 \u00d7 \nULN worsened to >3.5 x ULN to 5 \u00d7 ULN at the end of treatment, whereas 15 patients \n(39.5%) remained at >ULN to \u22643.5 x ULN and 22 patients (57.9%) improved to \u2264ULN. \nBaseline ALT was >3.5 x ULN - 5 \u00d7 ULN in one patient and >5 \u00d7 ULN in another, and both \npatients improved to >ULN - \u22643.5 x ULN at end of treatment. This change in ALT/AST \nexclusion criteria is further supported by previously published data in MDS patients showing \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 17 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nthat the decrease in serum ferritin with deferasirox treatment is associated with a decrease in \nALT indicating a possible association between reduction of iron overload and improvement in \nliver function (Gatterman 2010) \nThe serum creatinine exclusion criterion is slightly increased from >1.2 x ULN to > 1.5 ULN \naccording to the CTCAE grade 1 which is supported by data from the US03 study. \nAmong patients with normal (Grade 0) creatinine at baseline (N = 149), 48 patients (32.2%) \nhad shifts to Grade 1 and 4 patients (2.7%) had shifts to Grade 2. A total of 12 patients having \na Grade 1 serum creatinine at baseline had a Grade 2 value post-baseline; this represented \n54.5% of the 22 patients with a Grade 1 baseline value. Thus, the incidence of treatment \nemergent shifts from baseline in serum creatinine levels was 37.4% (64/171). Shifts of more \nthan one grade occurred for just those patients with a normal baseline. \nThe component of the composite endpoint defining liver function impairment as reflected by \nALT or AST changes is being modified in correspondence with the change in ALT/AST \nexclusion criterion from being > 2 x the baseline value and > 3 x ULN to > 2 x the baseline \nvalue and > 3.5 x ULN. The part of the component related to total bilirubin is left unchanged. \nThe component of the secondary efficacy endpoint defining \u201ctime to first occurrence of serum \nferritin\u201d has been modified to correspond with the change in the serum ferritin inclusion \ncriterion. \nShift table of ALT (U/L) from baseline value to end of study value (Pooled MDS \ndata (A0108 A2204 A2409 US02) - Per Protocol Set) \n \nEnd of study \n \nBaseline \n\u2264 ULN \n> ULN \u2013 \n\u2264 3.5 \u00d7 ULN \n> 3.5 \u00d7 ULN \u2013 \n\u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN \n> 5 \u00d7 ULN \n> 5 \u00d7 ULN \nand > 2 \u00d7 BL \nTotal \n \nn (%) \nn (%) \nn (%) \nn (%) \nn (%) \nn (%) \n\u2264 ULN \n28 (90.3) \n3 (9.7) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n31 (100.0) \n> ULN \u2013 \n\u2264 3.5 \u00d7 ULN \n22 (57.9) \n15 (39.5) \n1 (2.6) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n38 (100.0) \n> 3.5 \u00d7 ULN \u2013 \n\u2264 5 \u00d7 ULN \n0 (0.0) \n1 (100.0) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n1 (100.0) \n> 5 \u00d7 ULN \n0 (0.0) \n1 (100.0) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n1 (100.0) \nTotal \n50 (70.4) \n20 (28.2) \n1 (1.4) \n0 (0.0) \n0 (0.0) \n71 (100.0) \nAs of this amendment, 42 patients have been enrolled in the study, 81 have failed screening. \nWith the implementation of this amendment, more patients are expected to meet the eligibility \ncriteria to participate in the study. \nThe most frequent reason for screen failure due to laboratory assessment are summarized in \nthe table on the next page. \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 18 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nReason for screen failure due to laboratory assessment \nReason for Screen failure \nNumber of Patients \nALT or AST >2.5 x ULN \n15 \nTotal Bilirubin > ULN \n17 \nFerritin > 3500 mcg/L \n5 \nFerritin < 1000 mcg/L \n14 \nSerum Creatinine > 1.2 x ULN \n1 \nCreatinine Clearance < 40 ml/min \n5 \nSignificant Proteinuria \n4 \nChanges to the protocol amendment 3 \nChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the \nprotocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. \nChanges to List of Abbreviations \n\u2022 Abbreviations updated to reflect additions and deletions \nChanges to Protocol Synopsis and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (Sections 5.1 & 5.2) \n\u2022 The inclusion and exclusion criteria have been modified to remove the upper limit of \nserum ferritin at screening, to increase the ALT or AST exclusion criterion to > 3.5 x ULN \nat screening, to increase the bilirubin exclusion criterion to 1.5xULN at screening, and to \nincrease the serum creatinine exclusion criterion to 1.5 x ULN at screening. \nChanges to Section 3.1.1 Endpoints for primary objective \n\u2022 ALT or AST > 2 times the baseline value and >3.5 times ULN \nChanges to Section 4 Study design \n\u2022 Table 4-1 changed to Figure 4-1 \nNew study design figure included \n\u2022 A screening period lasting up to 35 days with two screening visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2 at \nleast 14 days apart) will be used to assess patient eligibility. \n\u2022 After 3 months of treatment, at the dose of 20mg/kg/day, dose may be adjusted by 5 to \n10 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/kg/day based on serum ferritin response. \nChanges to Section 5 Population \n\u2022 Male or female patients, > 18 years of age with low/int-1 MDS, as determined by IPSS \nscore, who have serum ferritin >1000 mcg/L at screening \nChanges to Section 5.1 Inclusion Criteria \n\u2022 Serum ferritin will be measured at Screening Visit 1 and Screening Visit 2 (at least 14 \ndays apart) and the mean value will be used for eligibility criteria. \nChanges to Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria \n\u2022 Serum creatinine will be measured at Screening Visit 1 and Screening Visit 2 (at least 14 \ndays apart) and the mean value will be used for eligibility criteria. \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 19 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nChanges to Section 6.1.2.1 Study Drug \nAfter 3 months of treatment at the dose of 20 mg/kg/day, the dose can be adjusted by 5 or \n10 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/kg/day based on serum ferritin response. \nChanges to Section title 6.7.1.3 \n\u2022 Elevations in serum creatinine \nChanges to Section 6.7.6 Premature patient withdrawal \n\u2022 If such withdrawal occurs, or if the patient fails to return for visits, the investigator must \ndetermine the primary reason for a patient\u2019s premature withdrawal from the study and \nrecord this information on the Study Evaluation Completion (778) eCRF and notify \nIVRS. \nChanges to Section 7 Visit schedule and assessments \n\u2022 Following registering in IRT for screening, patient eligibility will be checked once all \nscreening procedures are completed.

The notable changes to the inclusion criteria include allowing patients \ninto the trial that have been previously iron chelated for no more than six months \ncumulatively (such as daily deferasirox (Exjade) or deferiprone or 5x/week deferoxamine \nfrom only including those who were chelation na\u00efve. The minimum number of transfused \nunits of blood is being changed from 20 units to 15 units and patients entering the study must \nbe transfused with at least 8 units of PRBC annually from 8 times annually. The serum \ncreatinine entry criteria is being changed from requiring serum creatinine >ULN at screening \nto serum creatinine >1.2x ULN at screening. The exclusion criteria of prior diagnosis of liver \ncirrhosis is being defined as either an established diagnosis or diagnosis by liver biopsy or \ncentral ultrasound reading. The exclusion criteria pertaining to left ventricular ejection \nfraction <50% by echocardiography must be confirmed by the central reading facility used in \nthis trial. Lastly, patients with a history of another malignancy within the past five years, with \nthe exception of basal cell skin carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ, has been expanded to \ninclude completely resected colonic polyps carcinoma in situ. \nThe visit evaluation schedule is being revised to clarify the procedures required at the week \n260 visit (end of treatment visit) to allow for local laboratories to be used for weekly \nassessments that are required at the initiation of treatment and at the time of dose adjustments, \nas well to as to note that those patients who have a diagnosis of diabetes requiring treatment \nwith medication do not require a 2 hour fasting glucose tolerance test to be performed. \nThe screening visit period is being revised to allow for a 35 day screening window. This \namendment also serves to outline the details of the screening visit and further define \nlate/missed visits. \nThis first center was initiated on 1-December-2009 in Canada.

The notable changes are that the maximum \nserum ferritin level for inclusion is being raised from 2500 to 3500 mcg/L with a concurrent \nincrease of the maximum number of transfused units of blood from 50 to 75. Additionally, the \nexclusion criteria of more than 3 years from diagnosis of MDS is being changed to more than \n3 years from the time the patient became transfusion dependent. \nThe visit evaluation schedule is being revised to clarify the need for baseline BNP assessment \nand for a baseline chest x-ray, as well as to allow for local laboratories to be used for weekly \nserum creatinine assessments that are required at the initiation of treatment and at the time of \ndose adjustments. \nThe composite primary endpoint is being updated to include transformation to AML as one of \nthe parameters that composes the primary endpoint. Based upon recent data (Sanz 2008), iron \noverload may play a role in AML transformation in patients with MDS as patients with serum \nferritin levels of \u22651000 ng/ml had a significantly higher rate of AML transformation than \npatients with serum ferritin levels of < 1000 mg/ml. Given that progression to AML is an \nextremely significant medical event in terms of both morbidity and mortality, it is appropriate \nto include as part of the composite primary endpoint. \nChanges to the protocol Amendment 1 \nChanges to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the \nprotocol using strike-through red font for deletions, red (bold) for insertions. \nChanges to List of Abbreviations \n\u2022 Abbreviations updated to reflect additions and deletions \nChanges to Endpoint section \n\u2022 The composite primary endpoint has been updated to include transformation to AML as \none of the parameters that compose the primary endpoint. \nChanges to Secondary Endpoint section \n\u2022 This section has been amended to further define the progression of AML. \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 24 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nChanges to Section Protocol Synopsis, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria \n\u2022 Criteria have been amended to allow for an expanded weight range, to increase the upper \nlimit of Serum Ferritin and to increase the number of transfusions.

CICL670A2302 Study phase II Study title A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of deferasirox in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (Low/Intermediate-1 Risk) and transfusional iron overload.  Background Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis in one or more cell lineages and has the potential to evolve to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment goals for patients with low/int-1 risk MDS primarily involve managing cytopenias. While specific therapies and the use of growth factors may alleviate transfusion requirements in some patients, 60-80% of patients do not respond and require ongoing platelet and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions due to impaired hematopoiesis. In many patients, this leads to chronic RBC transfusion therapy and the development of secondary iron overload (IO). Liver dysfunction, cirrhosis and endocrinopathies have been described in multi-transfused MDS patients (even with a short-term duration of transfusion), where even mild liver function abnormalities have been associated with marked hepatic iron overload and portal fibrosis on biopsy (Schafer 1981, Jaeger 1992). Cardiac complications of iron overload secondary to long-term transfusion therapy are well-described in \u03b2-thalassemia major, but have not yet been well-described for the MDS population. Iron chelation therapy (ICT) has a long history in transfusion-dependent patients with hemoglobinopathies, primarily \u03b2-thalassemia major, with demonstrated improvement in organ dysfunction and survival in patients who are compliant with therapy (Olivieri 1997). Use of deferoxamine (DFO) in iron-overloaded MDS patients has been reported to improve organ dysfunction (Jensen 2003, Schafer 1985), and even improve cytopenias (Jensen 1996). With the use of ICT, there have also been reports of improvements in glucose metabolism in iron-overloaded thalassemia major patients (Farmaki 2006), and reduced insulin requirements in MDS patients (Schafer 1985). However, poor patient compliance associated with the necessity of repeated subcutaneous infusions, as well as the potential for increased bruising/bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia and/or platelet dysfunction are significant problems with DFO, particularly with elderly MDS patients. Therefore, the need exists for an iron chelator which could be administered via the more convenient oral route.  Iron overload may impact survival in MDS, which is especially relevant for low-risk patients. A recent retrospective analysis of 467 MDS patients demonstrated that cardiac failure and liver cirrhosis constituted 51% and 8%, respectively, of the non-leukemic causes of death (Malcovati 2005).  Moreover, secondary iron overload, reflected by a serum ferritin level greater than 1,000 ng/mL, was associated with a poorer overall survival (OS). Recent, uncontrolled studies suggest a benefit of ICT upon survival in MDS (Leitch 2007, Rose 2010, Sanz 2008). Leitch et al. reported results of a retrospective review of 178 MDS patients (60% with low/int-1 MDS).  Eighteen patients received ICT for a median of 15 months. In low/int-1 patients, the median OS was 40 months for those not receiving ICT compared with a median OS not reached at 160 months for patients receiving ICT. Also, 80% of patients receiving ICT survived to 4 years from the time of diagnosis compared to 44% without ICT. In a non-randomized, prospective 2 year follow-up of 165 MDS patients (59% low/int-1 risk) in an outpatient setting, Rose reported a median survival from time of diagnosis of 115 months in patients receiving ICT compared with 51 months in those who did not receive ICT. Sanz reported that the development of iron overload and transfusion dependency were strongly associated with AML transformation risk in MDS.These studies included patients with a wide range of transfusional iron intake, time since diagnosis of MDS and co-morbidities.  Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 29 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \n \nDeferasirox (Exjade\u00ae) is approved for the treatment of transfusional iron overload in over \n90 countries. Data on 47 MDS patients were included in the registration dossier (Study \nCICL670A0108). Efficacy was demonstrated based on changes in serum ferritin and liver \niron content. \n \nThe relationship between serum ferritin levels and clinical outcome is well described in \npatients with \u03b2-thalassemia (Cappellini 2006), but has not been well described in a \nprospective study until now. \n \nPurpose/rationale \nUse of iron chelation therapy has demonstrated benefits in terms of morbidity and \nmortality for chronically-transfused thalassemia patients with iron overload. Recent \nretrospective data (Leitch 2007, Rose 2010, Sanz 2008) suggest that overall survival \nmay be improved in adult patients with MDS who receive iron chelation therapy. The \npurpose of this study is to evaluate in low/int-1 risk MDS patients, treated as per \nstandard practice, the clinical benefit of deferasirox versus placebo, while rigorously \nmonitoring relevant clinical parameters (cardiac and liver function and transformation to \nAcute Leukemia AML) potentially affected by iron overload complications. \n \nObjectives \nThe primary objective is to evaluate deferasirox and placebo for event-free survival (a \ncomposite primary endpoint including death and non-fatal events related to cardiac and \nliver function, and transformation to AML) in low and int-1 risk MDS patients with \ntransfusional iron overload. \nThe secondary objectives are to evaluate: \n\u25cf Hematologic improvement (HI) in terms of erythroid response \n\u25cf Overall survival \n\u25cf Change in endocrine function (thyroid and glycemic control) \n\u25cf Disease progression (which includes MDS progression and progression to AML) \n\u25cf Change in serum ferritin level \n\u25cf Change in cardiac function \n\u25cf Frequency of infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials \n\u25cf Safety, in particular to assess the levels of increased risk for pre-specified adverse \nevents (renal dysfunction, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and \nlaboratory abnormalities) that would be clinically unacceptable in the context of the level \nof benefit that is likely to be provided by iron chelation using deferasirox in MDS patients \nwith iron overload (see Fleming 2008 for general approach). \n \nEndpoints (efficacy, \nsafety) \nComposite primary endpoint (event-free survival): \nTime from date of randomization to date when death or any of the non-fatal events \ndefined below has been reached (event-free survival): \n\u25cf Death \n\u25cf Non-fatal event: \n1.

(Matsuda 2005). \n \nThe study will continue for 3 years from the date the last patient is enrolled. \n \nThe end of study treatment may occur if a patient meets any non-fatal component of the \ncomposite primary endpoint (confirmed by the EAC). His/her individual randomized study \ntreatment will be unblinded and discontinued at that time. The subsequent iron chelation \ntreatment is subject to patient\u2019s and the investigator\u2019s decision. Patients will continue to \nbe followed every 6 months for iron chelation therapies and overall survival once he/she \ndiscontinues from the study treatment. \n \nPatients who discontinue study treatment without meeting a non-fatal component of the \ncomposite primary endpoint will continue to be evaluated every 3 months. Once patients \nstop study evaluations they will be followed for at least every 6 months for overall \nsurvival and any iron chelation therapies they are receiving up to the end of study. \n \nThe EAC is responsible for ensuring whether pre-specified endpoint criteria were met for \nall non-fatal events. The role of the EAC is to ensure that all events that have been \nreported by the sites are judged uniformly using the same criteria.

The FAS will be the primary analysis set for all statistical \nanalyses of efficacy. \n\u25cf The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS and comprises all \nrandomized patients whose first administered study medication was in accordance with \nthe randomized assignment, and without protocol deviations regarding inclusion criteria \nwith respect to underlying disease (e.g., low or intermediate-1 MDS according to IPSS \nand serum ferritin > 1000 mcg/L at screening). The PPS will be used as the secondary \nanalysis set to perform statistical analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint. \n\u25cf The Safety Analysis Set includes all randomized patients who received at least one \ndose of study medication. Patients will be analyzed according to the study treatment they \nactually received (defined as the study medication administered first) and according to \nstrata information recorded in the (e)CRF. All statistical analyses of safety and tolerability \nwill be based on the Safety Analysis Set. \nSignificance level: \nNo confirmatory hypothesis tests will be performed.

Therefore, two-sided 95% \nconfidence intervals for risk (or hazard, if applicable) ratios will be calculated. Incidences \nof treatment emergent (serious) adverse events (including combinations of MedDRA \nterms as defined by Standardized MedDRA Queries) will be summarized by treatment \ngroup. Laboratory data will be summarized using descriptive statistics and shift tables \n(using CTCAE classification where available) by treatment group. \nSample size: \nThe sample size of 210 patients randomized in a ratio of 2:1 in favor of deferasirox is \nbased on the enrollment projection. \nNovartis Confidential Page 36 Amended Protocol Version 05 (Clean)  Protocol No. CICL670A2302  ",

                "Title": "Overview of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)",
                "Content": " Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis in one or more cell lineages and by potential for evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment goals for patients with lower risk MDS primarily involve managing cytopenias. While specific therapies and the use of growth factors may alleviate transfusion requirements in some patients, 60-80% of patients do not respond and require ongoing platelet and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions due to impaired hematopoiesis. In many patients, this leads to chronic RBC transfusion therapy, and the development of secondary iron overload (IO). Liver dysfunction, cirrhosis and endocrinopathies have been described in multi-transfused MDS patients (even with a short-term duration of transfusion), where even mild liver function abnormalities have been associated with marked hepatic iron overload and portal fibrosis on biopsy (Schafer 1981, Jaeger 1992). Cardiac complications of iron overload secondary to long-term transfusion therapy are well-described in \u03b2-thalassemia major, but have not yet been well-described for the MDS population. Iron chelation therapy (ICT) has a long history in transfusion-dependent patients with hemoglobinopathies, primarily \u03b2-thalassemia major, with demonstrated improvement in organ dysfunction and survival in patients who are compliant with therapy (Olivieri 1997). Use of deferoxamine (DFO) in iron-overloaded MDS patients has been reported to improve organ dysfunction (Jensen 2003, Schafer 1985), and even improve cytopenias (Jensen 1996). With the use of ICT, there have also been reports of improvements in glucose metabolism in iron-overloaded thalassemia major patients (Farmaki 2006), and reduced insulin requirements in MDS patients (Schafer 1985). However, poor patient compliance associated with the necessity of repeated subcutaneous infusions, as well as the potential for increased bruising/bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia and/or platelet dysfunction are significant problems with DFO, particularly with elderly MDS patients. Therefore, the need exists for an iron chelator which could be administered via the more convenient oral route. Iron overload may impact survival in MDS, which is especially relevant for low-risk patients. A recent retrospective analysis of 467 MDS patients demonstrated that cardiac failure and liver cirrhosis constituted 51% and 8%, respectively, of the non-leukemic causes of death (Malcovati 2005). Moreover, secondary iron overload, reflected by a serum ferritin level greater than 1,000 ng/mL, was associated with a poorer overall survival (OS). Recent, uncontrolled studies suggest a benefit of ICT upon survival in MDS (Leitch 2007, Rose 2010, Sanz 2008). Leitch et al. reported results of a retrospective review of 178 MDS patients (60% with low/int-1 MDS). Eighteen patients received ICT for a median of 15 months. In low/int-1 patients, the median OS was 40 months for those not receiving ICT compared with a median OS not reached at 160 months for patients receiving ICT. Also, 80% of patients receiving ICT survived to 4 years from the time of diagnosis compared to 44% without ICT. In a nonrandomized, prospective 2 year follow-up of 165 MDS patients (59% low/int-1 risk) in an outpatient setting, Rose reported a median survival from time of diagnosis of 115 months in patients receiving ICT compared with 51 months in those who did Novartis Confidential Page 37 Amended Protocol Version 05 (Clean)  Protocol No. CICL670A2302  not receive ICT. Both studies included patients with a wide range of transfusional iron intake, time since diagnosis of MDS and co-morbidities. Sanz reported that the development of iron overload and transfusion dependency were strongly associated with AML transformation risk in MDS A recent review of safety data in 584 MDS patients pooled from Novartis-sponsored clinical trials confirms the current safety profile of deferasirox in the approved label regarding the most frequent adverse events associated with deferasirox such as gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and renal disorders (increased blood creatinine). The overall profile of adverse events in the reviewed population was consistent with the clinical features of MDS such as age-related co-morbidities, MDS-related clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.

                "Content": " Deferasirox (ICL670, Exjade\u00ae) is an N-substituted bis-hydroxyphenyl-triazole, a representative of a new class of tridentate iron chelators (Nick 2003) that has been developed by Novartis for treating transfusional iron overload. Two molecules of deferasirox form a complete complex with Fe3+. The high potency of deferasirox in mobilizing tissue iron and promoting iron excretion was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo model systems (Nick 2003). Deferasirox is eliminated from the body by hepatic glucuronidation and biliary excretion. Preclinical studies also revealed that deferasirox did not affect fertility and it is neither teratogenic nor carcinogenic. To date, deferasirox has been approved in more than 90 countries, including the European Union, the USA, Switzerland, and Japan for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions in adult and pediatric patients. Within this indication, deferasirox is approved for use in transfusion-dependent MDS patients, based on data demonstrating efficacy in reducing liver iron concentration (LIC) and serum ferritin. Detailed information on preclinical and clinical evaluation of deferasirox is provided in the current [Investigators\u2019 Brochure]. Deferasirox is formulated as a dispersible tablet for oral suspension which facilitates administration of the appropriate quantity of drug substance to both pediatric and adult patients. Deferasirox is supplied as 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg tablets which can be dispersed in water, orange juice or apple juice. Bioavailability studies indicate that absorption is highly variable when deferasirox is taken together with food. Therefore, it is recommended that deferasirox is taken in the morning on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes prior to food. More than 800 pediatric and adult patients aged 2 to 80 years were enrolled in randomized controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in the treatment of transfusional iron overload. At least 500 patients received deferasirox. The studies showed deferasirox to effectively chelate iron in patients with transfusional iron overload as demonstrated by decreases in liver iron concentration (LIC) and serum ferritin (Porter 2008), (Cappellini 2006), (Vichinsky 2007). The efficiency of deferasirox in chelating iron appears to be constant at all doses ranging from 5 to 40 mg/kg/day and is not affected by age, gender, baseline LIC or underlying anemia (Porter 2005).

                "Content": " Deferasirox has demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability in adult and pediatric patients with transfusional iron overload (Cappellini 2006), (Vichinsky 2007). The most frequent reactions reported during the first year of treatment with deferasirox in adult and pediatric patients included gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances in about 26% of patients (mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain), and skin rash in about 7% of patients. These reactions were dose-dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally transient and mostly resolved even if treatment was continued. In addition, there have been rare reports of upper GI hemorrhage and/or ulceration in patients receiving deferasirox. There have been very occasional postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme, leukocytoclastic vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema). Alopecia, usually comprising thinning of the hair, has been occasionally reported in patients receiving deferasirox. Mild, non-progressive increases in serum creatinine, mostly within the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients during the first year of treatment. These were dose-dependent, often resolved spontaneously and were sometimes alleviated by reducing the dose. Rare cases of acute renal failure, defined as a serum creatinine increases \u2265 2 \u00d7 ULN, and usually reversible after treatment interruption (and sometimes a brief course of hemodialysis), have been reported following the prescription use of deferasirox. Elevations of liver transaminases were reported as an adverse reaction in about 2% of patients. These were not dose-dependent and most of these patients had elevated levels prior to receiving deferasirox. Elevations of transaminases >10 \u00d7 ULN were uncommon (0.3%). There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, mostly in patients with severe baseline liver disease. There have been reports of cytopenias, mostly in patients with pre-existing blood disorders which are frequently associated with failure of the bone marrow to produce sufficient amounts of blood cells. High frequency hearing loss and lenticular opacities (early cataracts) have been uncommonly observed in patients treated with deferasirox. As with other iron chelator treatment, the risk of toxicity of deferasirox may be increased when inappropriately high doses are given in patients with a low iron burden or with serum ferritin levels that are only slightly elevated. In summary, deferasirox is a once-daily oral iron chelator that has been developed for treating transfusional iron overload, with demonstrated efficacy in the reduction or maintenance of body iron stores, and an acceptable safety profile.

Novartis Confidential Page 39 Amended Protocol Version 05 (Clean)  Protocol No. CICL670A2302  It is well understood how excess iron damages organs and tissues, and deferasirox has been clearly demonstrated to reduce iron burden, as measured by LIC and serum ferritin. Data on the correlation between serum ferritin and morbidity and mortality come mainly from the thalassemia population, so the relevance of serum ferritin as a surrogate for clinical benefit has not been definitively proven in the MDS setting. Recent retrospective data (Leitch 2007), (Rose 2010) suggest that overall survival may be improved in adult patients with MDS who receive iron chelation therapy. ",

        "Content": " This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study. A screening period lasting up to 35 days with two screening visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2 - at least 14 days apart.) will be used to assess patient eligibility. Should the 35 day screening period be exceeded due to delays in scheduling exams as outlined in the protocol (such as ocular exams, audiometry testing, ECHO, etc.) this delay will not be considered a protocol deviation and all laboratory assessments outlined in Visit 1 must be repeated. In the event that it is more convenient for the site, confirmatory laboratory assessments may be collected by a local laboratory. Prior to a patient being randomized in the study (Visit 3), both the inclusion and exclusion criteria must be evaluated and documented in the source documents as being met and the results of all screening assessments must be available and reviewed by the investigator. At the randomization visit (Visit 3), patients will be randomized to 10 mg/kg/day of either deferasirox or matching placebo in a 2:1 manner in favor of deferasirox. As a control medication, placebo matching to each of the strength of the active compound will be utilized. Randomization will be stratified using an interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS). The stratification will be defined by IPSS (low or int-1) as well as by geographical region (Asian versus non-Asian countries) since the Asian population have a longer survival (Matsuda 2005). Details on stratification will be outlined in the study manual provided by the IVRS vendor. Starting from Day 1, patients will receive either deferasirox 10 mg/kg/day or matching placebo for 2 weeks. At Week 2, the dose will be increased to 20 mg/kg/day deferasirox or matching placebo in all patients. This dose should be maintained through Week 14 unless there is a safety related issue (see Section 6.1.2.1). After 3 months of treatment, at the dose of 20mg/kg/day, dose may be adjusted by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/kg/day based on serum ferritin response. Study treatment should be administered by the patient once per day. During the treatment period, patients will return every 4 weeks to the site for routine procedures and for follow-up to monitor safety, efficacy and compliance with therapy. Should a patient require dose adjustments at any point during the trial, the patient may be asked to return more frequently to monitor safety and efficacy. The recruitment period is planned to last until December 2014. The study will continue for 3 years from the date the last patient is enrolled. Patients meeting a non-fatal component of the composite primary endpoint The end of study treatment will occur if a patient meets any non-fatal component of the composite primary endpoint (Section 3.1.1) confirmed by the Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC). His/her individual randomized study treatment will be unblinded and discontinued at that time. The subsequent iron chelation treatment is subject to the patient\u2019s Novartis Confidential Page 43 Amended Protocol Version 05 (Clean)  Protocol No. CICL670A2302  and the investigator\u2019s decision. After termination of study treatment, all patients will continue to be followed for safety and non-fatal components of the primary endpoint during the evaluation period at visits occurring every three months. Subsequent to the evaluation period, or at the end of treatment if a patient and treating physician decide that a patient will not participate in the evaluation period, patients will be followed every 6 months for iron chelation therapies and overall survival (\u201cSurvival Follow-up\u201d). All suspected endpoint events will be reviewed and adjudicated by the EAC; however, only the first confirmed endpoint for a patient will be counted for the composite primary endpoint. The role of the EAC is to ensure that all events that have been reported are judged uniformly using the same criteria. The EAC is blinded to study treatment. Patients not meeting a non-fatal component of the composite primary endpoint For patients who do not meet a non-fatal component of the composite primary endpoint, study treatment will continue as long as the patient and treating physician feel it is in the best interest of the patient, or until the study terminates. There is no planned unblinding for patients who terminate study treatment without meeting a non-fatal component of the composite primary endpoint. After termination of study treatment, all patients will continue to be followed for safety and endpoints during the evaluation period at visits occurring every three months. Subsequent to the evaluation period, or at the end of treatment if a patient and treating physician decide that a patient will not participate in the evaluation period, patients will be followed every 6 months for iron chelation therapies and overall survival (\u201cSurvival Follow-up\u201d). An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor patient safety and trial conduct and will receive a blinded summary of serious adverse events as detailed in the DMC Charter. The DMC may issue the following recommendations to the sponsor: \u2022 To continue the study as planned \u2022 To continue the study with modifications \u2022 To prematurely stop the study for unfavorable safety profile of deferasirox compared to placebo.

Effective contraception methods include: \u2022 Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. \u2022 Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.

The use of hormonal contraceptives (oral or injected) is prohibited in this study due to a decrease in efficacy when used in combination with deferasirox. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms).  Patients who are found to be ineligible after screening procedures will have this documented on the screening log (see Section 6.3 and Section 7.1).

The investigator or his/her delegate will call or log onto the IVRS/IWRS that will assign a randomization number to the patient once a series of eligibility questions are confirmed by the investigator or his/her delegate. The randomization number will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number(s) for the first package(s) of study drug to dispense to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. Randomization will be performed using the following procedure to insure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the IVRS provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. The patient randomization list will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Biostatistics Quality Assurance Group. The randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment groups, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication randomization list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis DSM using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to medication packs containing each of the study drugs. In the event that a patient is late for a regular scheduled visit, the visit week that should be followed and assessments that need to be recorded on the eCRF may vary. As a rule to follow, the time interval between the current scheduled \u201clate visit\u201d and the next scheduled visit should be divided in half. Should patients present themselves less than mid-way between visits (<15 days), the assessments that should be taken are those for the earlier visit.

Auditory and ophthalmic testing (see Section 7.5.4) is recommended \nbefore the start of deferasirox treatment and at regular intervals thereafter (every 12 months). \nIf disturbances are noted, dose reduction or interruption may be considered and a repeated \ntesting performed as per investigator\u2019s judgment. \nNovartis Confidential Page 59 Amended Protocol Version 05 (Clean)  Protocol No. CICL670A2302  6.7.1.9 Dose modification criteria for hypersensitivity reactions Cases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported in patients receiving deferasirox, with the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment. If reactions are severe, deferasirox should be discontinued and appropriate medical intervention instituted. 6.7.1.10 Dose modification criteria for cytopenias There have been post-marketing reports (both spontaneous and from clinical trials) of cytopenias in patients treated with deferasirox. Most of these patients had pre-existing hematological disorders that are frequently associated with bone marrow failure. The relationship of these episodes to treatment with deferasirox is uncertain. In line with the standard clinical management of such hematological disorders, blood counts should be monitored regularly. Interruption of treatment with deferasirox should be considered in patients who develop unexplained cytopenia. Reintroduction of therapy with deferasirox may be considered (as per investigator decision), once the cause of the cytopenia has been identified. ",

Most often, study drug discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study patient who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency code breaks are performed using the IVRS. When the investigator contacts the IVRS/IWRS to unblind a patient, he/she must provide the requested patient identifying information and confirm the necessity to unblind the patient. The investigator will then receive details of the drug treatment for the specified patient and a fax confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the Clinical Trial Head that the code has been broken. It is the investigator\u2019s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access to the IVRS in case of emergency. The investigator will inform the patient how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable. The protocol number, study drug name if available, patient number and instructions for contacting the local Novartis CPO (or any entity to which it has delegated responsibility for emergency code breaks) will be provided to the patient in case emergency unblinding is required at a time when the investigator and backup are unavailable.

Abnormal Laboratory values that do not meet this criteria are not reported as Adverse Events. SAEs occurring after signing the Informed Consent are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non-directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the patient during or between visits or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine: 1. The severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) 2. Its relationship to deferasirox (suspected/not suspected) Novartis Confidential Page 72 Amended Protocol Version 05 (Clean)  Protocol No. CICL670A2302  3. Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final examination) 4. Action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; non-drug therapy given; hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization) 5. Whether it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one which: \u2022 Is fatal or life-threatening \u2022 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity \u2022 Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect \u2022 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: \u2022 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition \u2022 Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent \u2022 Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of an SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission \u2022 Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient\u2019s general condition \u2022 Is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting requirements; see Section 8.1. All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stopping concomitant treatments, changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospitalization, or any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution, an assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in its severity, its suspected relationship to the study drug(s), any of the interventions required to treat it, and its outcome. Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the [Investigators\u2019 Brochure] or will be communicated between IB updates in the form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. ",

The equality of \nproportions in the two groups will be analyzed by an exploratory test. Further details will be \ndescribed in the RAP. \nOverall survival \nOverall survival (OS) will be evaluated in patients treated with either deferasirox or placebo. \nThe variable used in the analysis of overall survival is time to death measured in days. It is \ndefined as date of death (irrespective of cause) minus date of randomization plus 1. \nCensoring is described in Section 10.4.3. The estimation of survival functions and the Cox \nmodel to estimate the HR are defined in analogy to Section 10.4.2.1 and Section 10.4.2.2. An \nexploratory statistical test will be performed analog to the description in Section 10.4.2.3 and \nSection 10.4.2.4. In this analysis SD(t) and SP(t) denote the survival functions regarding \noverall survival for deferasirox and placebo, respectively. \nProportion of patients with hypothyroidism \nHypothyroidism will be evaluated by the annual measurement of TSH and free T4. The \nproportion of patients with normal thyroid function, primary hypothyroidism, secondary \nhypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism will be determined at each time point (i.e. 1, 2, \nyears after randomization). \nDefinitions: \n\u2022 \nnormal thyroid function: serum TSH and free T4 within normal limits; \n\u2022 \nprimary hypothyroidism: serum TSH >ULN and free T4 <LLN; \n\u2022 \nsecondary hypothyroidism: serum TSH <ULN and free T4 <LLN; \n\u2022 \nsubclinical hypothyroidism: TSH >ULN and a free T4 within normal limits. \nTPO antibodies will be measured in patients with elevated TSH levels to determine the status \nof thyroid autoimmunity. \nFrequency of newly occurring hypothyroidism and shift tables will be provided for each \ntreatment group. Results will also be shown separately for each year since randomization. \nProportion of patients with worsening of glucose metabolism \nAn annual oral glucose tolerance test will be carried out to evaluate changes of glucose \nmetabolism compared to the baseline status. The proportion of patients with an increase in \nglucose metabolism category (normal, impaired glucose metabolism, diabetes mellitus) based \non the American Diabetes Association criteria (American Diabetes Association 2009) \ncompared to their baseline result will be determined at each timepoint, i.e. 1, 2, years after \nrandomization. For this classification, fasting and 2-hour post-prandial plasma glucose levels \nwill be measured. \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 91 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nCriteria for impaired glucose metabolism: \n\u2022 fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels \u2265 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/L) but <126 mg/dl \n(7.0 mmol/L) \nOR \n\u2022 2-h values in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of \u2265 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L) but \n<200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L). \nCriteria for diabetes mellitus: \n\u2022 symptoms of diabetes plus casual plasma glucose concentration \u2265 200 mg/dl \n(11.1 mmol/L) Casual is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal. \nThe classic symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight \nloss. \nOR \n\u2022 FPG \u2265 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours. \nOR \n\u2022 2 hour postload glucose \u2265 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT. The test should be \nperformed as described by WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g \nanhydrous glucose dissolved in water. \nFrequency and shift tables will be provided for each treatment group. Results will also be \nshown separately for each year since randomization. \nDisease progression \nAn evaluation of the time from randomization to either MDS progression or progression to \nAML in the treatment groups will be done based on date of diagnosis of MDS progression or \ndate of first diagnosis of AML minus date of randomization plus 1. \nMDS progression will be defined as a transition into a higher MDS risk group based on IPSS \nscoring. Progression to AML will be defined based upon the most current classification \nguidelines (Vardiman 2009), as 20% or more blasts seen in the bone marrow collected by \nbiopsy or aspirate. \nThe time-to-event analysis follows the description given in Section 10.4.2.1 to Section \n10.4.2.4. Censoring for patients with neither MDS progression nor progression to AML at the \ntime of a data cut-off is described in Section 10.4.3. Further details will be described in the \nRAP. \nTime to first occurrence of serum ferritin > 2 times the baseline value \nAn evaluation of the time from randomization to the first occurrence of serum ferritin > 2 \ntimes the baseline value at two consecutive assessments (at least two weeks apart) will be \nperformed per treatment group based on the following variable: \n\u2022 date of the first of the two consecutive laboratory assessment fulfilling the criterion of SF \n> 2 \u00d7 baseline value minus date of randomization plus 1. \nNovartis \nConfidential \nPage 92 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \nThe time-to-event analysis follows the description given in Section 10.4.2.1 to Section \n10.4.2.4. Censoring for patients without such a serum ferritin increase at the time of a data \ncut-off is described in Section 10.4.3. \nTime to at least a 10% increase from baseline in LVIDD \nAn evaluation of the time from randomization to the first occurrence of an increase of at least \n10% from the baseline value of LVIDD will be performed based on the following variable: \n\u2022 date of echocardiography assessment where a minimum of 10% increase first occurred \nminus date of randomization plus 1. \nThe time-to-event analysis follows the description given in Section 10.4.2.1 to Section \n10.4.2.4. Censoring for patients without such an increase in LVIDD at the time of a data cut-\noff is described in Section 10.4.3. If necessary, further details will be described in the RAP. \nTime to at least a 10% increase from baseline in LVISD \nAn evaluation of the time from randomization to the first occurrence of an increase of at least \n10% from the baseline value of LVISD will be performed based on the following variable: \n\u2022 date of echocardiography assessment where a minimum of 10% increase first occurred \nminus date of randomization plus 1. \nThe time-to-event analysis follows the description given in Section 10.4.2.1 to Section \n10.4.2.4. Censoring for patients without such an increase in LVISD at the time of a data cut-\noff is described in Section 10.4.3. If necessary, further details will be described in the RAP. \nInfections \nInfections requiring intravenous antimicrobials during the treatment period (until the 28 day \nfollow-up visit) will be evaluated separately for each treatment group. \nDefinitions: \n\u2022 Infections will be determined from the reported adverse events with system organ class \n\"Infections and infestations\" and action taken \u201cConcomitant medication taken\u201d. \n\u2022 Antimicrobial therapy will be determined from the reported concomitant medications for \npatients who had an infection AE. The selection of medications will be based on a pre-\nspecified list of WHO low level ATC codes. The route of administration needs to be \nspecified as \u201cintravenous (i.v.)\u201d. \n\u2022 Contemplable events will be combined with medications (of the same patient) based on \nthe following criterion: start date of medication \u2265 start date of AE and start date of \nmedication \u2264 minimum (start date of AE + 1, end date of AE). \nThe total number of infections will be counted and summarized per treatment group. For this \nnumber one patient can contribute more than one infection event. To account for different \nlengths of observation time in the two groups, the rate of infections will be calculated with the \nnumber of recorded infections treated with intravenous antimicrobials divided by the total \nnumber of patient-years of follow-up. The relative risk of infection will be calculated as the \nrate of infection in the treatment group compared with the rate in the placebo group. \nNovartis Confidential Page 93 Amended Protocol Version 05 (Clean)  Protocol No. CICL670A2302  ",

Pre-treatment period: from day of patient\u2019s informed consent to the day before first dose of study medication. 2. On-treatment period: from day of first dose of study medication to 28 days after last dose of study medication. 3. Post-treatment period: starting at day 29 after last dose of study medication. Safety summaries (tables and figures) have to include only data from the pre-treatment period (to display \u201cbaseline status\u201d) and the on-treatment period, i.e. no data from the post-treatment period are to be included. In particular, summary tables for adverse events (AEs) will include only AEs that occurred or worsened during the on-treatment period, the so-called treatment-emergent AEs. However, all safety data (including those from the post-treatment period) will be listed and those collected during the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods will be flagged. 10.5.2.2 Secondary safety variables and related analyses Analyses of safety endpoints related to secondary objectives of the trial will be analyzed for the safety analysis set. Descriptive statistics and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (without adjustment for multiplicity) for evaluation of deferasirox in contrast to placebo will be used as appropriate. Proportion of patients with significant renal dysfunction Treatment groups will be evaluated regarding the proportion of patients experiencing a significant renal dysfunction. This is defined as a serum creatinine value \u2265 2 times ULN at two consecutive assessments. The two assessments need to be at least 7 days a part. Frequency tables by treatment group will be prepared. Results will also be provided for annual time intervals. Proportion of patients with severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia Proportion of patients with newly occurring CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia will be displayed by treatment group. Results will also be provided for annual time intervals. Proportion of patients with major gastrointestinal bleeding An evaluation of the proportion of patients with major gastrointestinal bleeding will be performed. Major gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as an AE that may include one of the following MedDRA preferred terms: Novartis \nConfidential \nPage 94 \nAmended Protocol Version 05 (Clean) \n \nProtocol No. CICL670A2302 \n \n \nGastric haemorrhage \nGastrointestinal haemorrhage \nSmall intestinal haemorrhage \nOesophageal haemorrhage \nLarge intestinal haemorrhage \nRectal haemorrhage \nMelaena \nDuodenal ulcer haemorrhage \nGastric ulcer haemorrhage \nPeptic ulcer haemorrhage \nLarge intestinal ulcer haemorrhage \nOesophageal ulcer haemorrhage \nHaematochezia \nFrequency tables will be prepared by treatment group. Results will also be provided for \nannual time intervals. \nIn addition, a statistical analysis of the multivariate (recurrent) major gastrointestinal bleeding \ndata will be performed. \nTime to study drug discontinuation due to an AE or laboratory abnormality \nAn evaluation of the time from randomization to study drug discontinuation due to an AE or \nlaboratory abnormality will be performed. The variable will be based on the date and reason \ngiven on the Study Treatment Completion eCRF page. Only patients for whom the reason for \nstopping study medication was entered as AE or laboratory abnormality will be considered. \nThe definition of the variable is: \n\u2022 date of study drug discontinuation due to an AE or laboratory abnormality minus date of \nrandomization plus 1. \nThe time-to-event analysis follows the description given in Section 10.4.2.1 to Section \n10.4.2.4.

Censoring is described in Section 10.4.3. \n10.5.2.3 Adverse events (AE) \nFrequency tables for treatment-emergent AEs (see Section 10.5.2.1) will present, for each \ntreatment group, the number of patients and the percentage of patients experiencing the AE. \nMultiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in the \nfrequency tables. However, all adverse events will be included in the AE listings. \nFrequency tables will display at least the MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, AE \nseverity (mild, moderate, severe), and relationship to study drug. \nDeaths reportable as SAEs and non-fatal serious adverse events will be listed by patient and \ntabulated by MedDRA preferred term and treatment group. \nNovartis Confidential Page 95 Amended Protocol Version 05 (Clean)  Protocol No. CICL670A2302  10.5.2.4 Analysis of laboratory data For analyzing laboratory data, data from all sources (central and local laboratories) will be combined. Other than for weekly serum creatinine monitoring visits, central laboratory results are the only laboratory results that will be captured in the database. Grading of laboratory data For laboratory tests covered by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 NCI 2006, the study\u2019s biometrics team will grade laboratory data accordingly with the exception of grade 5 (death). For laboratory tests covered by CTCAE, a grade 0 will be assigned for all non-missing values not graded as 1 or higher. For laboratory tests where grades are not defined by CTCAE, results will be graded by the low/normal/high classification based on laboratory normal ranges. Reporting of laboratory data The following by-treatment summaries will be generated separately for hematology, biochemistry and urinary laboratory tests: \u2022 Frequency table for newly occurring on-treatment grades 3 or 4. \u2022 Shift tables using CTCAE grades to compare baseline to the worst on-treatment value. \u2022 For laboratory tests where CTCAE grades are not defined, shift tables using the low/normal/high/(low and high) classification to compare baseline to the worst on-treatment value. For a specific laboratory test, patients with newly occurring on-treatment grade 3 or 4 are defined as: \u2022 Patients with baseline grade missing, 0, 1 or 2 and worst on-treatment grade 3 or 4 (percentage to be based on all patients with baseline grade missing, 0, 1 or 2). \u2022 Patients with baseline grade missing, 0, 1, 2 or 3 and worst on-treatment grade 4 (percentage to be based on all patients with baseline grade missing, 0, 1, 2 or 3). The following listings will be generated: \u2022 Listing of laboratory data for patients with newly occurring grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicities. \u2022 Listing of laboratory data for patients with values outside the laboratory normal ranges with values flagged to show the corresponding CTCAE grades and the classifications relative to the laboratory normal ranges. \u2022 Listing of all laboratory data with values flagged to show the corresponding CTCAE grades and the classifications relative to the laboratory normal ranges.
