The blood \nlaboratory tests in the definition of the \u201cadequate assessment\u201d are haemoglobin, platelets, ANC and lymphocytes. \n2If PD and new anti-cancer therapy occur on the same day, assume that progression was documented first (i.e. \noutcome is progression and the date is the date of the assessment of progression).  If anti-cancer therapy is started \nprior to any adequate assessments, censoring date should be the date of randomization.\nAn interim analysis of the primary endpoint, PFS, will be performed when 2/3 of the total \nnumber of events have occurred (187 events).  The interim analysis for PFS will be \nperformed by an IDMC utilizing a significance level of 0.001.  The interim analysis of \nPFS will be conducted in the same manner as described for the final analysis.

The Pike estimator, which is a nonparametric estimator of the HR, has been \nspecifically developed for survival data and is used as a measure of the relative survival \nexperience of two groups. Within the range of values of the ratio of the hazard rates of \ninterest in clinical trials, the Pike estimator is more efficient in terms of mean square error \nthan the Cox proportional hazard method [Bernstein, 1981]\nIf there are a sufficient number of progressions or deaths, median PFS, first and third \nquartiles and 95% CI, will be estimated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley method \n[Brookmeyer, 1982].

Treatment will remain forced in the \nmodel. An entry/removal significance level of 0.05 will be used.   Analytical results will \ninclude the estimated hazard ratios along with 95% confidence intervals and associated \nprobabilities for the effect of treatment, stratification factors, and the covariates.
