        "Content": "PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION D: \nRATIONALE \nProtocol BH21260 has been amended to prolong the study by approximately 6 years \nbecause of a lower than anticipated event rate (EMA was informed on 8 May 2014, \ne-CTD seq. 033). \nAdditional changes to the protocol are as follows: \n\u2022 \nFinal visit assessments at study end will be modified to match the primary objective \nof the study to assess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality \n\u2022 \nTo clarify adverse events reporting on serious adverse event reporting form in the \nelectronic Case Report Form \n\u2022 \nUpdate of Appendix 5 with the revised version of the MIRCERA\u00ae Educational \nProgram for anti-erythropoietin antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia associated \nwith erythropoietin stimulating agent \n\u2022 \nAdministrative changes in the text of the packaging and labeling \n\u2022 \nAdministrative changes in the procedures \n\u2022 \nAdministrative changes in the text in the section of electronic Case Report Form \nbecause of a change of data capture system. \n \nNo other changes have been made.  Substantive new information appears in italics.  \nThis amendment represents cumulative changes to the original protocol. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 2 \nPROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION D: \nSUMMARY OF CHANGES \nPROTOCOL SYNOPSIS \nThe protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where \napplicable. \nSECTION 3.1:  Overview of Study Design and Dosing Regimen\nThe total length of the study iswas estimated to be 4 years (30 months recruitment and \n18 months of follow-up on treatment after last patient randomized) until the pre-specified \nnumber of outcome events iswere recorded. Due to an event rate lower than \nanticipated, it is expected that the study will be prolonged by approximately 4-6 \nyears. \nSECTION 3.1.3:  End of Study \nThe study will end when a total of 1264 endpoint events have been recorded. \nInvestigators will be informed of the end of study. Each patient remaining in the \nstudy will have a final visit at this time. The end of the study is defined as the date of the \nlast visit of the last patient to complete the study. \nSECTION 5.4.1:  Clinical Assessments during the Treatment Period \nThe following clinical information and assessments will be collected/performed during \nthe randomized treatment period and at the final visit: \n Physical examination at the final visit or early withdrawal, including body weight \ndetermination. \n\u2013 Blood pressure: at each study visit, and except at the final visit:, blood pressure will \nbe measured before blood sampling using standard local techniques; BP should be \ndetermined both before and after the dialysis session for HD patients. The same \ntechnique (e.g., manual assessment, automated reading) should be used throughout \nthe entire study for every patient. Blood pressure should be measured in the sitting \nposition after at least 5 minutes rest. An appropriate-sized cuff should be used. Both \nsystolic and diastolic blood pressures should be recorded. \nSECTION 5.4.2:  Laboratory Assessments Dduring the Treatment pPeriod \nThe total volume of blood loss for laboratory assessments will be approximately \n2-4071 mL per visit with safety assessments representing a total of approximately \n112181 mL per year of participation.  \nThe following laboratory assessments will be performed during the randomized \ntreatment period:  \n\u2013 Hematology: \n\u2013 Platelet count at study visit 1, and at monthly visit and at the final visit. \n\u2013 Total white blood cell count at study visit 1, and every 3 months and at the final \nvisit. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 3 \n\u2013 Blood chemistry:   \n \n\u2013 CRP every 3 months and at the final visit. \n\u2013 Serum albumin, calcium, phosphorus, potassium at study visit 1, and every \n3 months and at the final visit. \n\u2013 Cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, glucose at study visit 1, and once a year and at the \nfinal visit. \n\u2013 12-lead ECG recording at study visit 1 and at the final visit before dose \nadministration. \nSECTION 6.3.2:  Packaging and Labeling of MIRCERA\u00ae \nStudy medication will be packaged and provided in an open label fashion. It will be \nsupplied with either study-specific labels or as commercially available product \nwith additional labeling, if required by national legislation. Each syringe will be \navailable in an individual blister with a needle for sc or iv administration. The package \nlabels will include the following information: protocol number, study drug name, \nstrength, lot number, re-tests date/used by (as per local guidelines), patient number, \nadministration date and safety precautions for clinical trials. \nSECTION 6.3.4:  Packaging and Labeling of Reference ESAs \nFor study centers/countries where reference ESAs will be supplied by Roche, reference \nESAs will be packed and labeled according to local specifications, in an open fashion. It \nwill be supplied with either study-specific labels or as commercially available \nproduct with additional labeling, if required by national legislation. Each PFS \nwill be available blistered in an individual box.  \nSECTION 6.5:  Assessment of Compliance \nTheis inventory and dispensing logs must be available for ongoing inspection by the \nMonitor. After injection, all empty blisters of PFS of MIRCERA\u00ae or reference ESA will \nbe kept in a container or in the medication box and will be made available for the Roche \nMonitor to check at each visit. All supplies, including partially used, expired and unused \nor empty containers and the dispensing logs, must be kept at the study site and returned to \ncopies of the inventory and dispensing logs will be retrieved by the Roche Monitor \nperiodically and at the end of the study. \nSECTION 6.6:  Destruction of the MIRCERA\u00ae/Reference ESAs \nThe unused, partially used or expired MIRCERA\u00ae/reference ESA PFS provided by the \nSponsor may be destroyed at the site or at the supplying depot following the current \nRoche and local Standard Operating Procedures as applicable. \nLocal or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used \nMIRCERA\u00ae/reference ESA PFS for safety reasons. In these cases, it may be acceptable \nfor investigational site staff to destroy dispensed MIRCERA\u00ae/reference ESA PFS \nbefore a monitoring inspection provided that source document verification is performed \non the remaining inventory and reconciled against the documentation of quantity shipped, \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 4 \ndispensed, returned and destroyed. Written authorization must be obtained from the \nsponsor at study start up before destruction. \nWritten documentation of destruction must contain the following: \n\u2013 Quantity of MIRCERA\u00ae/reference ESA PFS destroyed \n\u2013 Date of destruction (date discarded in designated hazardous container for \ndestruction) \n\u2013 Method of destruction (the site must provide the Sponsor with documentation \nof their institutional policy and procedures for handling and disposing of \ndrugs) \n\u2013 Name and signature of responsible person [or company] who destroyed discarded \nthe investigational products[s] in a hazardous container for destruction \nSECTION 7.1.1:  Clinical AEs \nClinical AEs encountered during the randomized treatment period and considered as \nserious by the investigator will be recorded on an AE eform of the eCRF (see figure \nin Appendix 1).  \nSECTION 7.2.1:  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events [immediately reportable] \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious [as defined in \nSection 7.1.1.3 above] and which occurs during the course of the study, regardless of the \ntreatment arm, must be reported to Roche within one working day24 hours of the \ninvestigator becoming aware of the event [expedited reporting]. The investigator must \ncomplete the SAE Reporting Form and forward it to the SAE Responsible. \nSECTION 8.2.2:  Sample Size \nNote:  The overall event rate observed during the study is considerably lower \nthan that expected at the planning stage.  Changing no other parameters leads to \nan extended study duration; the occurrence of 1264 events has been estimated to \nbe approximately 10 years after study start.   \nSECTION 15.4:  Electronic Case Report Forms \nData for this study will be captured via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system by \nusing eCRFs on a laptop. The data is entered on to the laptop using the off line mode. An \naudit trail will maintain a record of initial entries and changes made; reasons for change; \ntime and date of entry; and user name of person authorizing entry or change. The \ninvestigator will connect on a regular basis, using an analog phone line, and the data will \nbe transferred directly to the Roche database. \neCRFs are to be completed using a Sponsor-designated EDC system.  Sites will \nreceive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  \neCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in \naccordance with instructions from the Sponsor. \nThe investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data \nreported to the sponsor in the eCRFs and in all required reports. All eCRFs should be \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 5 \ncompleted by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be reviewed and \nelectronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.  At the end of \nthe study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a \nreadable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  \nAcknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. \nTABLE 1:  Schedule of Assessments \nTable 1 has been revised to reflect changes to the protocol. \nAPPENDIX 5:  Educational Program For MIRCERA\u00ae Anti-erythropoietin-\nmediated Pure Red Cell aplasia Associated with Erythropoietin \nStimulating Agents \nAppendix 5 has been updated with the revised version. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol

Once corrected, MIRCERA\u00ae patients should be treated with once \nmonthly administration. Patients with renal anemia on stable maintenance ESA therapy \nwill be randomized 1:1 to continue their current ESA treatment (group B) or to change to \nMIRCERA\u00ae treatment (group A) once-monthly. Stratification will be performed by \ntreatment setting (correction/maintenance) and baseline CRP category (\u2264  30 mg/L / \n>30 mg/L). \nPertinent variables to be documented at baseline include demographic parameters, \nmedical history and co-morbidities, co-medications, duration and type of prior ESA, \ntype of vascular access for hemodialysis and time since first dialysis. Baseline laboratory \nassessments include hemoglobin values, CRP, other laboratory parameters, dialysis \nadequacy parameters and anti-erythropoietin antibody determination. \nDuring the study, the participants will be treated according to the usual standard of care \nand current best practice guidelines. The doses of MIRCERA\u00ae and reference ESAs \nshould be adjusted according to approved label to achieve and maintain the individual \npatient\u2019s Hb levels within the Hb target range (10-12 g/dL).

These studies failed to demonstrate that \ncorrection of anemia to a target Hb of 13.5 g/dL or higher in patients with chronic kidney \ndisease not receiving dialysis reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. One study \nsuggested that this degree of correction of Hb level may be associated with an increased \nrisk without incremental improvement in quality of life. Taken together, these findings \nsuggest caution in the full correction of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.  \nThe global clinical development program for MIRCERA\u00ae included 13 Phase I clinical \npharmacology studies and 10 therapeutic studies comprising four Phase II and \nsix Phase III studies in patients with CKD, including patients on dialysis and not on \ndialysis. Administration of MIRCERA\u00ae for the treatment of anemia associated with \nCKD was generally well tolerated with no difference in the safety profile in comparison \nto reference erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) [3, 4].  \nData from phase III correction studies show that the Hb response rates in the \nMIRCERA\u00ae group at the end of the correction period were high (93.3% and 97.5% in \nthe studies in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis, respectively) and comparable to \ncomparators (91.3% and 96.3%, respectively). The median time to response was 43 days \nin the MIRCERA\u00ae arm and 29 days in the comparator arm with increases of hemoglobin \nwithin the first 6 weeks of 0.2 g/dl/week and 0.3 g/dl/week, respectively. \nFour randomized controlled phase III studies were performed in dialysis patients \ncurrently treated with darbepoetin alfa or epoetin. Patients were randomized to stay on \ntheir current treatment or to be converted to MIRCERA\u00ae in order to achieve stable \nhemoglobin levels. At the evaluation period (week 29-36), the mean and median level of \nhemoglobin in patients treated with MIRCERA\u00ae was virtually identical to their baseline \nhemoglobin level. \n1.1.1 \nStudy Drug \nMethoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (MIRCERA\u00ae) is a covalent conjugate of a \nprotein produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovarian cells and \nconjugated to a linear methoxy-polyethylene glycol (PEG). MIRCERA\u00ae is a continuous \nerythropoietin receptor activator that shows a different activity at the receptor level \ncharacterized by a slower association to and faster dissociation from the receptor, \na reduced specific activity in vitro with an increased activity in vivo, as well as an \nincreased half-life, in contrast to erythropoietin. The average molecular mass is \napproximately 60 kDa of which the protein moiety plus the carbohydrate part constitutes \napproximately 30 kDa.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 20 \nMIRCERA\u00ae stimulates erythropoiesis by interaction with the erythropoietin receptor on \nprogenitor cells in the bone marrow. As primary growth factor for erythroid development, \nthe natural hormone erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the \nbloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, the natural hormone \nerythropoietin interacts with erythroid progenitor cells to increase red cell production. \nThe approved reference ESA compounds in the study will be darbepoetin alfa \n(Aranesp\u00ae, Nespo\u00ae, Aranest\u00ae), epoetin alfa (Eprex\u00ae, Epogen\u00ae, Epopen\u00ae, Erypo\u00ae) \nand epoetin beta (NeoRecormon\u00ae, Recormon\u00ae).  \n1.2 \nRationale for the Study  \nAs part of the risk management plan, Roche proposes to gain more experience with \nMIRCERA\u00ae administered under clinical practice conditions and according to the \napproved label by performing a non-inferiority study comparing MIRCERA\u00ae to other \nESAs in terms of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. \n2. \nOBJECTIVES \n2.1 \nPrimary Objective \nThe primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of MIRCERA\u00ae versus reference \nESAs in terms of a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and non-fatal \ncardiovascular events (myocardial infarction (MI), stroke). \n2.2 \nSecondary objectives \nThe secondary objectives are to assess the incidence of anti-erythropoietin \nantibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), gastrointestinal bleeding and \nthromboembolic events. \n3. \nSTUDY DESIGN \n3.1 \nOverview of Study Design and Dosing Regimen   \nThe study will be a randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-centre parallel group, \nnon-inferiority trial comparing MIRCERA\u00ae to other ESAs. \nThe total length of the study was estimated to be 4 years (30 months recruitment and \n18 months of follow-up on treatment after last patient randomized) until the pre-specified \nnumber of outcome events were recorded. Due to an event rate lower than \nanticipated, it is expected that the study will be prolonged by approximately 4-6 \nyears. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 21 \nFigure 1 \nStudy Design \n \nAfter written informed consent is obtained, patients will be screened for eligibility. \nProviding all eligibility criteria are met, patients with renal anemia not treated with an \nESA will be randomly allocated 1:1 either to MIRCERA\u00ae once every two weeks \n(group A) or to a reference ESA treatment (group B) according to label for correction of \ntheir renal anemia. Once corrected, MIRCERA\u00ae patients should be treated with once \nmonthly administration. Patients with renal anemia on stable maintenance ESA therapy \nwill be randomized 1:1 to continue their current ESA treatment (group B) or to change to \nMIRCERA\u00ae treatment (group A) once-monthly. \n3.1.1 \nRationale for Study Design \n1264 events are sufficient to ensure 90% power to establish non-inferiority of \nMIRCERA\u00ae to comparator ESAs in terms of the composite endpoint based on a \nnon-inferiority margin of 1.20 and a one-sided significance level of 0.025, assuring that \nthe maximum difference between groups at the upper limit of the CI would be 6.1 % for \nthe composite endpoint and 3.6% for mortality. \n3.1.2 \nRationale for Dose Selection \nDosing will be performed as specified in the approved labels. \n3.1.3 \nEnd of Study \nThe study will end when a total of 1264 endpoint events have been recorded. \nInvestigators will be informed of the end of study. Each patient remaining in the \nstudy will have a final visit at this time. The end of the study is defined as the date of the \nlast visit of the last patient to complete the study. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 22 \n3.2 \nNumber of Subjects/ Assignment to Treatment Groups  \n2800 patients, [1400 per treatment arm] will be recruited over a planned recruitment \nperiod \nof \n30 \nmonths. \nStratification \nwill \nbe \ndone \nby \ntreatment \nsetting \n(correction/maintenance) and baseline CRP category (\u2264 30 mg/L / > 30 mg/L). \n3.3 \nCenters \nPatients will be recruited in approximately 200-250 centers (around 10 patients per site).  \n4. \nSTUDY POPULATION \nThe patient population will consist of adult patients (\u226518 years old) with symptomatic \nanemia associated with CKD (renal anemia).  \n20 percent of the study population will be patients with renal anemia, who are not treated \nwith an ESA and who require correction of anemia. \nThe remaining 80 percent of the study population will consist of patients with renal \nanemia who are on maintenance ESA therapy. They will continue their current \nESA treatment or change to MIRCERA\u00ae treatment once-monthly. \nThe proportion of patients not on dialysis will be around 20%; approximately 76% of \npatients are expected to be on hemodialysis and 4% of patients on peritoneal dialysis. \nUnder no circumstances are patients who enroll in this study permitted to be \nre-randomized to this study and enrolled for a second course of treatment. \n4.1 \nInclusion Criteria \nPatients must fulfill all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for \nstudy enrolment.  \n\u2013 Written informed consent \n\u2013 Adult patients (\u2265 18 years old) with symptomatic anemia associated with CKD \n(renal anemia)  \n\u2013 Patients with renal anemia who are not treated with an ESA: \no Anemia defined as Hb concentration < 11.0 g/dL (mean of 2 screening \nvalues with at least one day and a maximum of 2 weeks between \nmeasurements) with a clinical indication for ESA treatment \nor \n\u2013 Patients with renal anemia who are on maintenance ESA therapy:  \no If on dialysis: regular long-term hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis \ntherapy with the same mode of dialysis for at least 3 months \nbefore screening \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 23 \no Continuous iv or sc maintenance ESA therapy: darbepoetin alfa \n(Aranesp\u00ae, Nespo\u00ae, Aranest\u00ae), epoetin alfa (Eprex\u00ae, Epogen\u00ae, \nEpopen\u00ae, Erypo\u00ae) or epoetin beta (NeoRecormon\u00ae, Recormon\u00ae) \nadministered according to approved label of the same agent and route of \nadministration for at least 2 months before screening \no Hb concentration between 10 and 12 g/dL (mean of 2 screening values \nwith at least one day and a maximum of 2 weeks between measurements) \n\u2013 Patients with adequate iron status defined as: serum ferritin above or equal to \n100 \u03bcg/L or transferrin saturation above or equal to 20% (See section 4.4 of the \nSmPC [14]) \n4.2 \nExclusion Criteria \nContraindications to ESA treatment (See Section 4.3 of SmPC [14]):Uncontrolled \nhypertension  \n\u2013 Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients of MIRCERA\u00ae and \nother ESAs \n\u2013 Any other contraindication to ESA therapy \nConditions known to cause inadequate response to ESA treatment or anemia other than \nsymptomatic anemia associated with CKD, including (See Section 4.4. of the SmPC [14]): \n\u2013 Hemoglobinopathies (e.g., homozygous sickle-cell disease, thalassemia of all types) \n\u2013 Anemia due to hemolysis  \n\u2013 Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA)  \nOther: \n\u2013 High likelihood of early withdrawal (e.g. within 1 year) or interruption of the study  \n\u2013 Pregnancy or breast-feeding \n\u2013 Women of childbearing potential without effective contraception \n\u2013 Administration of another investigational drug within 1 month before screening or \nplanned during the study period \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 24 \n4.3 \nConcomitant Medication and Treatment \nAll treatments (medications and medical procedures) are permitted before screening, \nduring the screening period and throughout the treatment period except for: \n\u2013 Investigational drugs (defined as any material, i.e. placebo or drug, dispensed under \nthe provision of a protocol) within 1 month before screening, during screening or the \ntreatment periods. Participation in studies testing investigational devices should be \nreported to the sponsor in advance and approved in writing by the sponsor. \nAll treatments administered within 3 months before the first screening visit and started or \nstopped at any time during the screening or treatment periods (including those to treat AEs) \nshould be documented in the appropriate sections of the eCRF. \nIt is expected that patients will be treated according to good clinical practice and current \nguidelines, particularly with respect to substitution therapy with iron, vitamin B12 and \nfolic acid. \n4.3.1 \nIron Supplementation \nAn adequate iron status is a prerequisite to achieve and maintain target Hb levels. Iron \ndeficiency during treatment may cause a reduced erythropoietic response to ESA therapy. \nIn addition, ESA therapy results in increased erythropoiesis that may lead to a depletion \nof iron stores. The iron status will be monitored throughout the study by assessing serum \nferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). TSAT will be calculated as described in \nAppendix 3. The percentage of hypochromic RBCs can be determined instead of TSAT.  \nPatients should be iron-replete at baseline and should maintain an adequate iron status \nthroughout the randomized treatment period. \nAdequate iron status is defined as serum ferritin  \u2265  100 \u03bcg/L and TSAT  \u2265  20% \n(or percentage of hypochromic red cells < 10%).  \nSupplemental iron will be administered to prevent iron deficiency during the screening \nperiod and during the treatment period, when either serum ferritin is < 100 \u03bcg/L or \nTSAT is < 20% (or percentage of hypochromic RBCs is \u2265 10%).  \nIron supplementation will be administered orally or intravenously, according to centre \npractice. If oral iron is not sufficient to correct iron deficiency, iv iron should be given. \nIf iron treatment is ongoing at the start of the study, it should not be interrupted.  \nTo avoid iron toxicity, iv iron therapy should be temporarily discontinued in patients with \nserum ferritin > 800 \u03bcg/L or TSAT > 50%, until serum ferritin is \u2264 800 \u03bcg/L and TSAT \nis \u2264 50%. \nIn order to obtain accurate measures of the iron parameters, we strongly recommend to \nfollow the European and the NKF-K/DOQI guidelines [6, 7] on the time interval needed \nbetween administration of an iv iron dose and the performance of the measurements. \nThis interval depends on the iron preparation and single dose administered: blood \nsampling for iron parameters should be performed at least 1 week after the administration \nof a >100 mg/dose of any iv iron preparation. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 25 \nAll oral and iv iron supplementations administered within 3 months before screening and \nstarted/stopped at any time during the screening and treatment periods should be \ndocumented in the iron supplementation section of the eCRF. \n4.3.2 \nRed Blood Cell Transfusions \nAll RBC transfusions administered during the study should be documented (i.e., specified \nby number of units transfused) on the RBC transfusions section of the eCRF. \nThe pretransfusion Hb level should be measured before each RBC transfusion and \nrecorded in the eCRF. \n4.3.3 \nDialysis  \nFor patients on dialysis, dialysis modality (HD or PD), PD type, the number of \nHD sessions per week, the type of vascular access for HD, time since first dialysis and \ndialysis adequacy assessments should be documented in the eCRF.  \nDialysis treatment should be performed according to current guidelines [8, 9]. \nIf a patient not on dialysis requires dialysis (HD or PD) due to worsening of renal \nfunction, CrCl/GFR should be determined (using either the abbreviated MDRD or the \nCockcroft-Gault equations; see Appendix 3). For the continuation of the study, pre- and \npost-dialysis blood pressure should be measured at each visit. The start of dialysis and \ndialysis modality should be documented in the dialysis eform of the eCRF. \n4.4 \nCriteria for Premature Withdrawal  \nPatients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. \nThe investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study in the event of \nintercurrent illness, AEs, insufficient therapeutic response, pregnancy, unacceptable \ntoxicity of the study drug or administrative reasons. \nIn case of kidney transplantation, the patient should be withdrawn from study; the final \nvisit should take place before the transplantation, otherwise there will be no final visit. \nThe investigator should contact the patient or a responsible relative either by telephone or \nthrough an office/clinic visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the \nwithdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient\u2019s withdrawal should be \nmade with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing from the study. If the reason \nfor removal of a subject from the study is an Adverse Event, the principal specific event \nwill be recorded on the eCRF. The subject should be followed until the Adverse Event \nhas resolved, if possible. \nAn excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study non-interpretable; therefore, \nunnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided. Should a subject decide to \nwithdraw, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations prior to \nwithdrawal as thoroughly as possible. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 26 \n4.5 \nReplacement Policy [Ensuring Adequate Numbers of \nEvaluable Subjects] \n4.5.1 \nFor Subjects \nNo subject prematurely discontinued from the study for any reason will be replaced.  \n4.5.2 \nFor Centers \nA center may be replaced for the following administrative reasons:   \n\u2013 Excessively slow recruitment. \n\u2013 Poor protocol adherence. \n5. \nSCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES \nWritten informed consent must be obtained from the patient before any study-specific \nassessment or procedure is initiated. \nA follow-up (final) visit will be performed for all patients at study end or at any time \nduring the study in case of premature withdrawal. Thereafter patients should be treated \naccording to individual center practice. In case of premature withdrawal due to kidney \ntransplantation, the final visit should necessarily take place before the transplantation, \notherwise there will be no final visit.  \nThe schedule of assessments and procedures to be performed during the screening and \nthe randomized treatment periods are described in Table 1. \nAll the results collected throughout the study should be documented in the eCRF. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 27 \nTable 1 \nSchedule of Assessments \n \nScreening \n[1]  \n \nRandomized treatment period \n \n \nVisit \nS1 \nVisit \nS2 \nVisit 1 \nR [2] \n \nFinal  \nVisit \nInformed Consent \nX \n \n \n \n \nMedical History [3] \nX \n \nX \n \n \nPregnancy Test [4] \nX \n \n \n \n \nPhysical Examination [5] \nX \n \n \n \n \nBlood Pressure [6] \nX \nX \nX \nmonthly \n \nHb [7] \nX \nX \nX \nmonthly or twice monthly [7] \nX \nPlatelet Count \nX \n \nX \nmonthly \n \nCRP \nX \n \n \nevery 3 months \n \nOther Safety Laboratory \nParameters [8] \n \nX \nevery 3 months \n \nIron Parameters [9] \nX \n \n \nevery 3 months \n \nCholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, \nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)  \n \nX \nonce a year \n \nCardiac markers [10] \n \nin case of suspected MI \nCoagulation laboratory tests [11] \n \nin case of bleeding adverse events \nKt/V or URR or CrCl/GFR, serum \ncreatinine [12] \n \nX \nevery 6 months \n \nAnti-erythropoietin Antibody  \n \nX \nonce a year \nX \n12-lead ECG Recording \n \nX \n \n \nConcomitant Treatment \nX \nX \nongoing, recorded at monthly visit \nX \nAdverse Events \n \nX \nongoing,  recorded at monthly visit \nX \nComposite Endpoint Assessments \n[13] \n \nX \nongoing,  recorded at monthly visit \nX \nDrug Administration \nX \nX \nongoing,  recorded at monthly visit \n \nBlood samples should be drawn prior to injection of MIRCERA\u00ae/reference ESA. \nR = Randomization should be performed before the first scheduled MIRCERA\u00ae or reference ESA administration at     \nstudy visit 1. \n1. \nThe second Hb and BP assessments are to be made at a second screening visit with at least one day and a \nmaximum of 2 weeks between first and second screening visit.  \n2. \nStudy visit 1 should take place on the day of the first MIRCERA\u00ae or reference ESA administration and not more \nthan 2 weeks after visit S2.  \n3. \nMedical history including demographics, the etiology of CKD, dialysis modality (HD or PD), PD type, number of HD \nsessions per week, time since first dialysis, type of vascular access for HD for dialysis patients, previous treatments \nincluding ESA treatment, anticoagulant during dialysis and iron supplementation, previous and concomitant diseases \nincluding risk factors and dialysis-related events (recorded before the first scheduled drug administration at study visit 1) \nand intercurrent events occurring during screening will be documented before the first scheduled drug administration at \nstudy visit 1.  \n4. \nSerum pregnancy test only to be performed in female patients of childbearing potential. \n5. \nGeneral physical examination includes height (measured only at screening) and body weight.  \n6. \nSystolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured before blood sampling; BP should be determined both before and \nafter the dialysis session for HD patients.  \n7. \nTwice monthly Hb measurements until Hb has stabilized, and monthly thereafter.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 28 \n8. \nTotal white blood cell count, serum albumin, calcium, phosphorus, potassium.  \n9. \nSerum iron, serum ferritin, serum transferrin or TIBC, calculated TSAT or percentage of hypochromic RBCs.  \n10.

Composite endpoint assessments: deaths, AEs of MI, stroke. \n \n5.1 \nScreening Examination and Eligibility Screening Form \nAll subjects must sign and date the most current IRB/IEC-approved written informed \nconsent before any study specific assessments or procedures are performed. \nAfter signed written informed consent is obtained, patients will be screened for \neligibility. Patients must fulfill all the entry criteria for participation in the study. \nDuring the screening period, patients on ESA treatments will continue to receive their \ntreatment at the same dose, route (iv or sc) and dosing interval as before screening.  \nAn Eligibility Screening Form [ESF] documenting the investigator\u2019s assessment of each \nscreened subject with regard to the protocol\u2019s inclusion and exclusion criteria is to be \ncompleted by the investigator. \nA screening failure log along with the reasons for screening failure must be maintained \nby the investigator. \nPatients who fail screening may be re-screened if it is considered likely that they could \nlater become eligible. There is a limit of 3 screening attempts for each patient.  \n5.2 \nProcedures for Enrolment of Eligible Subjects  \nAt the end of the screening period, patients fulfilling all the inclusion and none of the \nexclusion criteria will be randomized into the study. The randomization should be \nperformed before the first scheduled ESA or MIRCERA\u00ae administration at visit 1. \nVisit 1 should not be more than 2 weeks after the second screening visit. \nProviding all eligibility criteria are met, patients with renal anemia not treated with an ESA \nwill be randomly allocated 1:1 either to MIRCERA\u00ae once every two weeks (group A) or to \na reference ESA treatment (group B) according to label for correction of their renal anemia. \nPatients with renal anemia on stable maintenance ESA therapy will be randomized 1:1 to \ncontinue their current ESA treatment (group B) or to change to MIRCERA\u00ae treatment \nonce-monthly (group A). Stratification will be performed by treatment setting \n(correction/maintenance) and by baseline CRP category (\u2264 30 mg/L/>30 mg/L).\nThe subject randomization number will be generated by Roche or its designee and \nincorporated into a set of subject numbers and associated treatment[s] which will be \ngiven to the investigator at the time of individual subject enrolment.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 29 \nThe investigator or designee will use the eCRF with the assigned subject number and \nenter the corresponding number for allocation to the treatment groups in the appropriate \nplace on each subject\u2019s eCRF. \nThe subject randomization numbers are to be allocated sequentially in the order in which \nthe subjects are enrolled according to the specification document agreed with the external \nrandomization company/centre. \n5.3 \nAssessments during the Screening Period \n5.3.1 \nClinical Assessments during the Screening Period  \nThe following clinical information and assessments will be collected/performed during \nthe screening period and before first study drug administration:  \n\u2013 Medical history: demographics, the etiology of CKD, dialysis modality (HD or PD), \nPD type, number of HD sessions per week, time since first dialysis, type of vascular \naccess for HD for dialysis patients, previous treatments including ESA treatment and \niron supplementation, previous and concomitant diseases including risk factors and \ndialysis-related events.  \n\u2013 General physical examination: includes height and body weight determination. \n\u2013 Blood pressure will be measured before blood sampling using standard local \ntechniques; BP should be determined both before and after the dialysis session for \nHD patients. The same technique (e.g., manual assessment, automated reading) \nshould be used throughout the entire study for every patient. Blood pressure should \nbe measured in the sitting position after at least 5 minutes rest. An appropriate-sized \ncuff should be used. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures should be recorded. \nBP will be measured at 2 screening visits with at least one day and a maximum of \n2 weeks between measurements. \n\u2013 Intercurrent events occurring during the screening period will be documented before \nfirst study drug administration. \n\u2013 Treatments administered during the screening period including ESA treatment, \niron supplementation, antihypertensive treatments and anticoagulation therapy used \nfor HD. \n5.3.2 \nLaboratory Assessments during the Screening Period \nNormal ranges for the study laboratory parameters must be supplied to Roche before the \nstudy starts. Blood sampling should always be performed before ESA administration. \nThe following laboratory assessments will be performed during the screening period \n(before first study drug): \n\u2013 Hematology:  \n\u2013 Hb: hemoglobin for each patient will be measured at 2 screening visits with at \nleast one day and a maximum of 2 weeks between measurements.  \n\u2013 Platelet count \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 30 \n\u2013 Iron parameters:   \n \n\u2013 Serum ferritin, serum iron  \n\u2013 Serum transferrin (or TIBC) \n\u2013 TSAT (or hypochromic RBCs). TSAT will be calculated (see Appendix 3 \nfor calculation).  \n\u2013 CRP \n\u2013 Serum pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential. Patients who are \namenorrheic for at least 12 months are not considered of childbearing potential.  \n5.4 \nAssessments during the Treatment Period \n5.4.1 \nClinical Assessments during the Treatment Period  \nThe following clinical information and assessments will be collected/performed during \nthe randomized treatment period and at the final visit: \n\u2013 MIRCERA\u00ae (group A) and ESA (group B) administration.   \n\u2013 Other treatments including iron supplementation, antihypertensive treatments and \nanticoagulation therapy used for HD. \n\u2013 Blood pressure: at each study visit, except at final visit, blood pressure will be \nmeasured before blood sampling using standard local techniques; BP should be \ndetermined both before and after the dialysis session for HD patients. The same \ntechnique (e.g., manual assessment, automated reading) should be used throughout \nthe entire study for every patient. Blood pressure should be measured in the sitting \nposition after at least 5 minutes rest. An appropriate-sized cuff should be used. Both \nsystolic and diastolic blood pressures should be recorded. \n\u2013 Adverse events: monitored throughout the randomized treatment period. Serious AEs \n(SAEs), including composite endpoint assessments, will be monitored up to 30 days \nafter the last study drug administration (see section 7.2). \n5.4.2 \nLaboratory Assessments during the Treatment Period \nNormal ranges for the local study laboratory parameters must be supplied to Roche \nbefore the study starts.  \nThe total volume of blood loss for laboratory assessments will be approximately 2-40 mL \nper visit with safety assessments representing a total of approximately 112 mL per year \nof participation.  \nBlood sampling during the study should always be performed before MIRCERA\u00ae or \nESA administration.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 31 \nThe following laboratory assessments will be performed during the randomized \ntreatment period:  \n\u2013 Hematology: \n\u2013 Hb at study visit 1, at monthly visit and at the final visit.

Further increases of approximately 25% (or 50% according to \napproved label in the country) may be made at monthly intervals until the individual \ntarget Hb level is obtained.  \nIf the rate of rise in Hb is greater than 2 g/dL in one month or if the Hb level is increasing \nand approaching 12 g/dL, the MIRCERA\u00ae dose is to be reduced by approximately 25% \n(or 50% according to approved label in the country). If the Hb level continues to increase, \ntherapy should be interrupted until the hemoglobin level begins to decrease, at which \npoint therapy should be restarted at a MIRCERA\u00ae dose approximately 25% below the \npreviously administered dose.  \nDose adjustments should not be made more frequently than once a month. \nIf the desired Hb concentration is reached for the individual patient, MIRCERA\u00ae may be \nadministered once monthly using the dose equal to twice the previous once every \ntwo weeks dose.  \nDose adjustment for the reference ESA should be done according to the approved label \n[10, 11, 12, 13]. \n6.1.2.2 \nPatients Treated with an ESA \nIf a dose adjustment is required to maintain the Hb concentration of 10 -12 g/dL, \nthe MIRCERA\u00ae monthly dose may be increased by approximately 25% [3, 4, 14]. \nIf the rate of rise in Hb is greater than 2 g/dL over a month or if the Hb level is increasing \nand approaching 12 g/dL, the MIRCERA\u00ae dose is to be reduced by approximately 25% \n(or 50% according to approved label in the country). If the Hb level continues to increase, \nMIRCERA\u00ae therapy should be interrupted until the Hb level begins to decrease, \nat which point therapy should be restarted at a MIRCERA\u00ae dose approximately 25% \nbelow the previously administered dose. MIRCERA\u00ae Dose adjustments should not be \nmade more frequently than once a month. \nSince the treatment experience is limited in patients on peritoneal dialysis, regular \nHb monitoring and strict adherence to dose adjustment guidance is recommended in \nthese patients. \nDose adjustment for the reference ESA should be done according to the approved label \n[10, 11, 12, 13]. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 34 \n6.2 \nPreparation and Administration of MIRCERA\u00ae \nand Comparator[s] \nMIRCERA\u00ae in PFS will be administered by sc or iv injection.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign \n[including an abnormal laboratory finding], symptom, or disease temporally associated \nwith the use of a medicinal [investigational] product, whether or not considered related to \nthe medicinal [investigational] product. Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a \nstudy are to be reported as AEs. \nClinical AEs encountered during the randomized treatment period will be recorded on an \nAE eform of the eCRF (see figure in Appendix 1).  \nKidney transplantation and routine diagnostic procedures/tests are not considered AEs and \nshould therefore not be recorded on an AE eform of the eCRF.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 37 \nIn patients not on dialysis, start of dialysis should not be considered as an AE and should \nbe recorded on a specific eCRF form. If the worsening of kidney function justifying \ndialysis is faster than expected, the worsening of kidney function may be recorded as an \nAE term and the dialysis procedure should be recorded in the treatment section of the AE \neform. \nCardiac laboratory tests (e.g., troponin I, troponin T) will be assessed in case of \nsuspected MI.  \nCoagulation laboratory tests (e.g., prothrombin time (PT) or INR, thrombin time (TT), \npartial thromboplastin time (PTT)) will be assessed in case of bleeding adverse events. \n7.1.1.1 \nIntensity  \nAll clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE eform of \nthe eCRF. Intensity of AEs will be graded on a three-point scale [mild, moderate, severe] \nand reported in detail on the eCRF.  \nMild \ndiscomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity. \nModerate \ndiscomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity. \nSevere \ninability to work or perform normal daily activity \n \n7.1.1.2 \nDrug - Adverse event relationship \nThe relationship of the AE to the treatment should always be assessed by the investigator. \nThe relationship can be one of two possibilities: \n\u2013 No (unrelated; equals not drug related).  \n\u2013 Yes (the event has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the drug, or causality \nis unknown). \nThe criteria used for determining causality relationship can be found in Appendix 1. \n7.1.1.3 \nSerious Adverse Events [Immediately Reportable to Roche] \nA Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, \ncontraindication, side effect or precaution. It is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 is fatal; [results in death**; NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event]  \n\u2013 is life threatening [NOTE: the term \"life-threatening\" refers to an event in which the \nsubject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an \nevent which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe]. \n\u2013 requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 38 \n\u2013 is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above. \n**The term sudden death should only be used when the cause is of a cardiac origin as per \nstandard definition (see guidance notes for completing the SAE reporting form [\n]). \nThe terms death and sudden death are clearly distinct and must not be used \ninterchangeably\n20\n. \nThe study will comply with all local regulatory requirements and adhere to the full \nrequirements of the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and \nStandards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 (Appendix 2).  \n7.1.2 \nTreatment and Follow-up of AEs  \nAEs, especially those for which the relationship to study medication(s) is not \u201cunrelated\u201d, \nshould be followed up until they have returned to baseline status or stabilized. If after \nfollow-up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be established an explanation \nshould be recorded on the eCRF. \n7.1.3 \nLaboratory Test Abnormalities \nLaboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory results eform of the eCRF, \nor appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the \ncentral laboratory, if applicable. Recommendations for grading adverse events and \nlaboratories abnormalities can be found in Appendix 4.   \nAny treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result which is clinically significant, \ni.e., meeting one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded as a single \ndiagnosis on the AE eform in the eCRF: \nAccompanied by clinical symptoms \nLeading to a change in study medication [e.g. dose modification, interruption or \npermanent discontinuation] \nRequiring a change in concomitant therapy [e.g. addition of, interruption of, \ndiscontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy \nor treatment]. \nAny laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event [SAE] \nshould be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF. \n7.1.3.1 \nFollow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values \nIn the event of medically significant unexplained abnormal laboratory test values, \nthe tests should be repeated and followed up until they have returned to the normal range \nand/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. If a clear explanation is \nestablished it should be recorded on the eCRF.  \n7.2 \nHandling of Safety Parameters \n7.2.1 \nReporting of Serious Adverse Events [immediately reportable] \nAny clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious [as defined in \nSection 7.1.1.3 above] and which occurs during the course of the study, regardless of the \ntreatment arm, must be reported to Roche within 24 hours of the investigator becoming \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 39 \naware of the event [expedited reporting]. The investigator must complete the SAE \nReporting Form and forward it to the SAE Responsible. \nThe investigator must fax the completed SAE reporting form directly to the Roche local \ncountry contact person for SAEs (local monitor, see the Administrative and \nContact Information).  \nRelated SAEs MUST be collected and reported regardless of the time elapsed from the \nlast study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  \nUnrelated SAEs must be collected and reported during the study and for up to 30 days \nafter the last dose of study medication. \nThis study adheres to the definition and reporting requirements of ICH Guideline for \nClinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, \nTopic E2. Complete information can be found in Appendix 2. \nAs an exception, the following SAEs unrelated to study drug, which are common in the \ndialysis population, will not be reported in an expedited manner on an SAE reporting form \n(but will be recorded as SAEs on the AE pages of the eCRF): \n- \nThrombosis of vascular access for dialysis in HD patients  \n- \nPeritonitis in PD patients \nAll SAEs, including the two categories listed above, occurring during the randomized \ntreatment period or within 30 days after the last injection of MIRCERA\u00ae or other ESAs \nwithin study, should be documented as SAEs on the AE eforms of the eCRF (See Figure \nin Appendix 1).  \n7.2.2 \nPregnancy  \nNo data are available from adequate, controlled studies of MIRCERA\u00ae or other ESAs in \npregnant women. Therefore, women of childbearing potential must have a serum \npregnancy test at screening and must use a reliable method of contraception throughout \nthe study (see Appendix 3). \nA female subject must be instructed to stop taking the study medication and immediately \ninform the investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study. The investigator should \nreport all pregnancies within one working day to the sponsor using the \nPregnancy Reporting Form. The investigator should counsel the subject, discuss the risks \nof continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the \npatient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Pregnancies occurring up to \n90 days after the completion of the study medication must also be reported to \nthe investigator.  \n7.3 \nWarnings and Precautions  \nNo evidence available at the time of the approval of this study protocol indicated that \nspecial warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the SmPC [14]. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 40 \n7.4 \nLoss of effect  \nHb values will be monitored regularly throughout the study, and dose adjustments to \nachieve target Hb levels will be made according to protocol guidance (6.1). \nLoss of effect is defined as: a decline in Hb of at least 2.8 g/dL in a 4-week period \nwithout transfusion or requirement for transfusion of one blood unit or more per week for \na minimum of two consecutive weeks in the absence of overt bleeding or blood loss, \nunder uninterrupted treatment with study drug and with dose changes according to \nprotocol guidance [18]. \nIf loss of effect is suspected, the cause should be actively sought. Possible causes include: \niron deficiency, infection, inflammation, occult blood loss, hyperparathyroidism, \nmyelofibrosis, and malignancy. If a cause for loss of effect is not found, a hematologist \nshould be consulted (bone marrow examination) and an unscheduled blood sample \nshould \nbe \nobtained \nfor \na \nreticulocyte \ncount \nand \nan \nanti-erythropoietin \nantibody determination.  \nIf a diagnosis of PRCA is not confirmed, the patient should be maintained on the study \ndrug and other possible causes of loss of effect should be investigated. \nIf a diagnosis of PRCA is confirmed, treatment with the study drug should be stopped. \nThe patient should not receive another epoetin and causes of PRCA should be \ninvestigated. The patient should proceed with the study assessments as scheduled. \nIn addition, reticulocyte counts and anti-erythropoietin antibody testing will be performed \nevery 8 weeks until the end of the study (see Appendix 5). \n8. \nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN \n8.1 \nPrimary and Secondary Study Endpoints \n8.1.1 \nPrimary Endpoints \nThe primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the time to composite of:  \nall-cause mortality  \nnon-fatal cardiovascular events (MI, stroke) \n \ndefined as the time between first dose of study medication and the date of death or \nnon-fatal cardiovascular events (MI, stroke), whatever occurs first. Patients for whom no \nendpoint event is captured on the clinical database are censored at their last day in \nthe study. \n8.1.2 \nSecondary Endpoints \nSecondary endpoints are the time to the individual components of the composite endpoint: \nthe time to death, the time to non-fatal cardiovascular events (MI or stroke), the time to \nMI and the time to stroke. \n8.1.3 \nOther Safety Endpoints \nThe safety of the treatment will also be evaluated on the basis of AEs, laboratory tests \nand vital signs, as described in section 8.2.6. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 41 \nAll subjects who receive at least one dose of treatment will be included in the \nsafety evaluation. \n8.2 \nStatistical and Analytical Methods \n8.2.1 \nStatistical Model  \n8.2.1.1 \nPrimary Endpoint \nThe analysis of time to event endpoints is based on the survivor function, which is the \nprobability to survive or, more generally, to remain event-free beyond a certain point in \ntime. The primary endpoint will be analyzed with a Cox\u2019s proportional hazards model to \nestimate the hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval between the two treatment \ngroups. The underlying proportional hazards model is \n)\nexp(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n0\nZ\nt\nt\n\u03b2\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n=\n. Thereby, \u03b2 is \nthe coefficient corresponding to the binary vector Z taking the value 0 for patients on the \nreference arm and the value 1 for patients on the MIRCERA\u00ae arm, and \u03bb0(t) is the \nbaseline hazard of the reference treatment. Based on this, the following non-inferiority \nhypothesis for the hazard ratio (hMR = exp(\u03b2)) between MIRCERA\u00ae and reference will \nbe tested by comparing the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio \nto 1.20: \n \nH0: hMR \u2265 1.20   versus     H1: hMR < 1.20  \nThe null hypothesis will be rejected if the upper limit of the confidence interval is below \n1.20. The underlying Cox regression model will retain treatment as factor.  \nIn addition, analyses based on Cox models adjusted for the baseline stratification factors \nand other clinically relevant baseline variables such as CRP at screening, age and \nbaseline risk factors will be reported.  \n8.2.1.2 \nSecondary Endpoints \nKaplan-Meier methods and frequency tables will be used to describe the time to the \ncomposite endpoint as well as the time to the individual components of the composite \nendpoint for the MIRCERA\u00ae versus reference group. The survival function will be \nsummarized for the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile and their \n95% confidence intervals. The plot of Kaplan-Meier estimates for the two treatment \ngroups will be presented. The un-stratified log-rank test will be used to compare survivor \nfunctions between the two treatment groups. \nIn addition, analyses based on Cox models adjusted for the baseline stratification factors \n(including CRP) and other clinically relevant baseline variables such as age and baseline \nrisk factors will be reported.  \n8.2.2 \nSample Size \nThe randomization will be stratified by treatment setting (correction/maintenance) \nand baseline CRP category (\u2264 30 mg/L / >30 mg/L). The stratification will ensure that \n20% of patients will be recruited in the correction setting and 80% in the maintenance \nswitch setting.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 42 \nThe expected yearly event rate is approximately 20%, based on  \n\u2013 an expected 25% composite endpoint rate (a mortality rate of approximately 16% \n[15, 16] and non-fatal cardiovascular morbidity of approximately 9% [17]) in the \nmaintenance setting (80% of patients) \n\u2013 a 7% rate for the combined endpoint in the correction setting (20% of patients) \n[CSR BA16738] \nAssuming linear recruitment over 30 months and a follow-up time of 18 months after \nrandomization of the last patient, a sample size of 2800 patients, representing \napproximately 7700 patient-years of exposure, would be adequate to observe 1264 events \nof the composite endpoint of death and non-fatal cardiovascular events.  \n1264 events are sufficient to ensure 90% power to establish non-inferiority of \nMIRCERA\u00ae to comparator ESAs in terms of the composite endpoint based on a \nnon-inferiority margin of 1.20 and a one-sided significance level of 0.025.  \nDuration \n(months) \nNI limit \n(HR) \nEvent \nrate per \nyear \nNo. \nevents / \nNb \npatients \nExpected \nEvent rate \nat end of \nstudy (%) \nHighest \nevent rate \nbased on \nNI limit \n(%) \nAbsolute \n/ relative \ndifference \n(%) \nAbsolute and \nrelative \ndifference in \ndeaths (%) \n48 \n1.2 \n0.2 \n1264 / \n2800 \n45.2 \n51.2 \n6.1 / 13 \n3.6 / 13 \n \nNote:  The overall event rate observed during the study is considerably lower \nthan that expected at the planning stage.  Changing no other parameters leads to \nan extended study duration; the occurrence of 1264 events has been estimated to \nbe approximately 10 years after study start.   \n \n8.2.3 \nHypothesis Testing  \nThe primary endpoint is the time between first dose of study medication and the date of \ndeath or non-fatal cardiovascular events (MI, stroke), whatever occurs first. \nThe hypotheses to be tested are:  \nH0: hMR \u2265 1.20   versus     H1: hMR < 1.20 \nUsing the correspondence between tests and confidence intervals, the test for non-inferiority \nwill be based on the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the hazard \nratio of the two groups. When the upper confidence interval limit is lower than 1.20, \nthe MIRCERA\u00ae group will be regarded as clinically non-inferior to the reference group. \nThe corresponding p-value will be calculated via the standard normal distribution: \n\u239f\u239f\n\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\n\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2212\n\u03a6\n=\n<=\n=\nSE\nh\nT\nt\nP\np\nMR\n20\n.1\nln\n\u02c6\nln\n)\u02c6\n(\n,  \nwhere SE denotes the standard error of \n and \nMR\nh\u02c6\nln\n\u03a6  is the cumulative distribution \nfunction of the standard normal distribution. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 43 \n8.2.4 \nAnalysis Populations \nThe primary analysis will be performed based on the safety population defined as all \npatients randomized who receive at least one dose and had at least one post-dose \nsafety assessment.  \nIn addition, the primary analysis will be performed based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) \npopulation \ndefined \nas \nall \npatients \nrandomized \naccording \nto \nthe \noriginal \ntreatment assignment.  \n8.2.5 \nEfficacy Analysis \nThis is a safety study; no formal efficacy analyses will be performed. Hemoglobin over \ntime and dose will be analyzed descriptively. \n8.2.5.1 \nInterim Analysis \nNo formal interim analyses are planned. Safety updates will be prepared for review by \nthe DSMB at its scheduled meetings (see section 10.2). \n8.2.6 \nOther Safety Data Analyses \nThe safety parameters will be vital signs, AEs and the safety laboratory parameters \nincluding iron parameters.  \nAdverse event data will be presented in frequency tables (overall and by intensity) \nby body system. In tables showing the overall incidence of adverse events, subjects who \nexperienced the same event on more than one occasion are counted only once in the \ncalculation of the event frequency. Adverse events will be summarized throughout the \nwhole study treatment period and up to 30 days after the last administration of \nstudy treatment. \nDeaths will be listed and summarized descriptively. Vital signs and laboratory data will \nbe analyzed descriptively and will be assessed for clinically relevant abnormalities as \nwell as changes from baseline. The results of the exploratory statistical analysis of \nNT-proBNP and troponin T will be reported separately.   \nDemographic and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized by treatment arm \nfor all randomized patients. \nThe secondary objectives (incidence of anti-erythropoietin antibody-mediated pure red \ncell aplasia (PRCA), gastrointestinal bleeding and thromboembolic events), will be \nanalyzed using descriptive statistics and analytical methods such as risk ratios, \nCox regression and ANOVA methods. \n9. \nDATA COLLECTION, MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE \nThe overall procedures for quality assurance of clinical study data are described in the \nRoche Standard Operational Procedures. \nData for this study will be recorded via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system using \nelectronic Case Report Forms. It will be transcribed by the site from the paper source \ndocuments onto the eCRF. (In no case is the eCRF to be considered as source data for \nthis trial.) \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 44 \nAccurate and reliable data collection will be assured by verification and cross\u2013check of \nthe eCRFs against the investigator\u2019s records by the study monitor [source document \nverification], and the maintenance of a drug\u2013dispensing log by the investigator.  \nA comprehensive validation check program utilizing front-end checks in the eCRF and \nback-end checks in the Roche database will verify the data and discrepancies will be \ngenerated accordingly. These are transferred electronically to the eCRF at the site for \nresolution by the investigator. \nThroughout the study the SMT will review data according to the SMT Data Review Plan \nas described in the Data Quality Plan.  \n9.1 \nAssignment of Preferred Terms and Original Terminology \nFor classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by the Sponsor to the \noriginal terms entered on the eCRF, using the most up-to-date version of the \nMedical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology for adverse events \nand diseases and the International Non-proprietary Name (INN) Drug Terms and \nProcedures Dictionary for treatments and surgical and medical procedures. \n10. \nSTUDY COMMITTEES \n10.1 \nSteering Committee \nA Steering Committee will be put in place consisting of a group of study investigators \nand representatives of the Sponsor. The tasks of the Steering Committee include protocol \ndevelopment, review of study conduct, and management of issues arising during the trial. \n10.2 \nDSMB \nAn independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of 3 clinical \nexperts in the field and a statistician will be constituted to review the safety data, \nincluding adjudicated outcomes, collected during the study. A non-voting clinical \nscientist representative of Roche will also be available to assist the DSMB with \nclarification of issues related to the protocol and study management. \nThe board will review baseline risk factors as specified in section 5.3 and the safety data \nwhen approximately 25% (316) of the required events have been recorded and \nadjudicated. In addition, the board will review the data when 50% (632) and 75% (948) \nof events have occurred. Following each meeting the DSMB will give recommendations \nregarding continuation or discontinuation of the study to the sponsor according to \npre-specified rules recorded in the DSMB charter.  \nThe Board may recommend stopping the study due to safety reasons, as described in the \nDSMB charter.  \nThe analyses provided to the DSMB will be prepared by an external independent \nstatistician from the independent data coordinating center (iDCC). Further details about \nthe role and procedures of the DSMB will be provided in the DSMB charter.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 45 \n10.3 \nEndpoint Committee \nAn independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee will be constituted to review all \npotential endpoint events. The Endpoint Adjudication Committee will consist of at least \ntwo cardiologists, one nephrologist and one neurologist with experience in clinical \nstudies and in the adjudication of study endpoints. The committee will provide a blinded \nassessment of fatal and non-fatal events in the composite endpoint.  \nSuspect events will be recorded by the treating personnel in the dialysis centers. \nThe Sponsor will supply the Committee members with blinded patient level data for \nreview. For the list of documents see Appendix 6. The suspect events will be adjudicated \nby blinded committee members, with subsequent blinded adjudication in the case \nof disagreement.  \nThe Endpoint Committee and the Sponsor will establish the classification definitions in \naccordance with the study protocol before the adjudication process begins. Further details \nabout the role and procedures of the Endpoint Committee will be provided in a separate \ndocument, the Endpoint Adjudication Committee charter.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 46 \n11. \nREFERENCES \n1. \nSingh AK et al.

The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in \u201cGuideline for Good \nClinical Practice\u201d ICH Tripartite Guideline or with local law if it affords greater \nprotection to the subject. For studies conducted in the EU/EEA countries, the investigator \nwill ensure compliance with the EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC]. For studies \nconducted in the USA or under US IND, the investigator will additionally ensure \nadherence to the basic principles of \u201cGood Clinical Practice\u201d as outlined in the current \nversion of 21 CFR, subchapter D, part 312, \u201cResponsibilities of Sponsors and \nInvestigators\u201d, part 50, \u201cProtection of Human Subjects\u201d, and part 56, \u201cInstitutional \nReview Boards\u201d. \nIn other countries where a \u201cGuideline for Good Clinical Practice\u201d exists, Roche and the \ninvestigators will strictly ensure adherence to the stated provisions. \n12.2 \nInformed Consent  \nWritten Informed Consent from Subjects: \nIt is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by the investigator \n[if acceptable by local regulations], to obtain signed informed consent from each subject \nprior to participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, \nanticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study. For the subject not qualified or \nincapable of giving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legally \nacceptable representative. In the case where both the subject and his/her legally \nacceptable representative are unable to read, an impartial witness should be present \nduring the entire informed consent discussion. After the subject and representative have \norally consented to participation in the trial, the witness\u2019 signature on the form will attest \nthat the information in the consent form was accurately explained and understood. \nThe investigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are completely free to \nrefuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason. The electronic \nCase Report Forms (eCRFs) for this study contain a section for documenting subject \ninformed consent, and this must be completed appropriately. If new safety information \nresults in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be \nreviewed and updated if necessary. All subjects (including those already being treated) \nshould be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form and give \ntheir consent to continue in the study. \nFor non-US-IND studies:In a life-threatening situation where a patient is unconscious or \notherwise unable to communicate, the emergency is such that there is not enough time to \nobtain consent from the patient's legally acceptable representative, and there is no other \nor better treatment available, it is permissible to treat the patient under protocol with \nconsent of the investigator, with appropriate documentation that the IEC had approved \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 49 \nthe procedures used to enroll patients in such situations. In addition, the patient or his/her \nlegally acceptable representative should be informed about the trial as soon as possible \nand consent to continue, giving written consent as described above. \n12.3 \nIndependent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Board  \nIndependent Ethics Committees (IECs) [non-US] For EEA member states, the sponsor \nwill submit to the Competent Authority and Ethics Committees the protocol and any \naccompanying material provided to the subject (such as subject information sheets or \ndescriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent as well as any advertising or \ncompensation given to the subject). \nApproval from the committee must be obtained before starting the study, and should be \ndocumented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the committee met \nand granted the approval. \nAny modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the IEC\u2019s approval must be \nre-submitted by the investigator in the US and by the Sponsor in the EEA member states \nin accordance with local procedures and regulatory requirements. \nWhen no local review board exists, the investigator is expected to submit the protocol to \na regional committee. If no regional committee exists, Roche will assist the investigator \nin submitting the protocol to the European Ethics Review Committee. \nInstitutional Review Board [US]: It is the understanding of the sponsor that this \nprotocol [and any modifications] as well as appropriate consent procedures and \nadvertisements, will be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board. \nThis board must operate in accordance with the current Federal Regulations. The sponsor \nwill receive a letter or certificate of approval prior to initiation of the study, and also \nwhenever subsequent amendments/modifications are made to the protocol. \n13. \nCONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL \nRequests from investigators to modify the protocol to ongoing studies will be considered \nonly by consultation between an appropriate representative of the sponsor and the \ninvestigator [investigator representative[s] in the case of a multicenter trial]. \nProtocol modifications must be prepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially \nreviewed and approved by the Clinical Science Leader/Clinical Pharmacologist \nand Biostatistician. \nAll protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Independent Ethics \nCommittee or Institutional Review Board for information and approval in accordance with \nlocal requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required. Approval must be obtained \nbefore any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an \nimmediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the change[s] involves only logistical or \nadministrative \naspects \nof \nthe \ntrial \n[e.g. \nchange \nin \nmonitor[s], \nchange \nof \ntelephone number[s]. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 50 \n14. \nCONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY \nBoth the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. \nShould this be necessary, both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual study \nbasis after review and consultation. In terminating the study, Roche and the investigator \nwill assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects\u2019 interests. \n15. \nSTUDY DOCUMENTATION, ECRFS AND RECORD KEEPING \n15.1 \nInvestigator's Files / Retention of Documents \nThe Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of \nthe study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. \nThese documents should be classified into two different separate categories [1] \nInvestigator's Study File, and [2] subject clinical source documents. \nThe Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, DCS and schedule of \nassessments, \nIndependent \nEthics \nCommittee/Institutional \nReview \nBoard \nand \ngovernmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, \nstaff \ncurriculum \nvitae \nand \nauthorization \nforms \nand \nother \nappropriate \ndocuments/correspondence, etc. In addition at the end of the study the investigator will \nreceive the patient data, which includes an audit trail containing a complete record of all \nchanges to data, query resolution correspondence and reasons for changes, in human \nreadable format on CD which also has to be kept with the Investigator\u2019s Study File. \nSubject clinical source documents [usually defined by the project in advance to record \nkey efficacy/safety parameters independent of the eCRFs] would include subject \nhospital/clinic \nrecords, \nphysician's \nand \nnurse's \nnotes, \nappointment \nbook, \noriginal laboratory reports, ECG, EEG, X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, \nsigned informed consent forms, consultant letters, and subject screening and enrollment \nlogs. The Investigator must keep these two categories of documents (including the \narchival CD) on file for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study. \nAfter that period of time the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.  \nShould the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to \nanother location, Roche must be notified in advance. \nIf the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site \nfor any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the \nInvestigator and Roche to store these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that \nthey can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source \ndocuments are required for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copies should be \nmade for storing outside of the site. \n15.2 \nSource Documents and Background Data \nThe investigator shall supply the sponsor on request with any required background data \nfrom the study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly important when errors \nin data transcription are suspected. In case of special problems and/or governmental \nqueries or requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the \ncomplete study records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 51 \n15.3 \nAudits and Inspections \nThe investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be made \navailable to appropriately qualified personnel from the Roche Pharma Development \nQuality Assurance Unit or its designees or to health authority inspectors after appropriate \nnotification. The verification of the eCRF data must be by direct inspection of \nsource documents. \n15.4 \nElectronic Case Report Forms \neCRFs are to be completed using a Sponsor-designated EDC system.  Sites will \nreceive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  \neCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in \naccordance with instructions from the Sponsor. \nFor each subject enrolled, an eCRF must be completed and electronically signed by the \nprincipal investigator or authorized delegate from the study staff. This also applies to \nrecords for those patients who fail to complete the study [even during a \npre-randomization screening period if an eCRF was initiated]. If a patient withdraws \nfrom the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a patient is withdrawn from the \nstudy because of a treatment-limiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly \ndocument the outcome. \nThe investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data \nreported to the sponsor in the eCRFs and in all required reports. All eCRFs should be \ncompleted by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be reviewed and \nelectronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.  At the end of \nthe study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a \nreadable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  \nAcknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. \n16. \nMONITORING THE STUDY \nIt is understood that the responsible Roche monitor [or designee] will contact and visit \nthe investigator regularly and will be allowed, on request, to inspect the various records \nof the trial [eCRFs and other pertinent data] provided that subject confidentiality is \nmaintained in accord with local requirements. \nIt will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout \nthe study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and \naccuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor must verify that the subject \nreceived the study drug assigned by the randomization center (by controlling the written \nconfirmation of the randomization by IVRS). The monitor should have access to \nlaboratory test reports and other subject records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF. \nThe investigator [or deputy] agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any \nproblems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 52 \n17. \nCONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT \nRECORDS \nThe investigator must assure that subjects\u2019 anonymity will be maintained and that their \nidentities are protected from unauthorized parties. On eCRFs or other documents \nsubmitted to the sponsor, subjects should not be identified by their names, but by an \nidentification code. The investigator should keep a subject enrollment log showing codes, \nnames and addresses. The investigator should maintain documents not for submission to \nRoche, e.g., subjects\u2019 written consent forms, in strict confidence. \n18. \nPUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS \nThe results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is \nforeseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Roche prior to \nsubmission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide \ncomments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to \nthe investigator.   \nIn accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, Roche will generally support \npublication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data. \nIn this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. \nAny formal publication of the study in which input of Roche personnel exceeded that of \nconventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and \nthe appropriate Roche personnel. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 53 \nAppendix 1 \nAEs Categories for Determining Relationship to Test Drug \nUNRELATED \nThis category is applicable to those AEs which are judged to be clearly and \nincontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes [disease, environment, etc.] and do not meet \nthe criteria for drug relationship listed under remote, possible, or probable. \nRELATED \nPROBABLE [must have first three] \nThis category applies to those AEs which are considered, with a high degree of certainty, to \nbe related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probable, if: \n1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n2. It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject\u2019s \nclinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered \nto the subject. \n3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. [There are important \nexceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet \ndrug-relatedness clearly exists; e.g., [1] bone marrow depression, \n[2] tardive dyskinesias.] \n4. It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected medication. \n5. It reappears upon rechallenge. \n \nPOSSIBLE [must have first two] \nThis category applies to those AEs in which the connection with the test drug \nadministration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be \nconsidered possible if, or when: \n1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n2. It may have been produced by the subject\u2019s clinical state, environmental or toxic \nfactors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. \n3. It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected medication. \n \nREMOTE [must have first two] \nIn general, this category is applicable to an AE which meets the following criteria: \n1. It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. \n2. It may readily have been produced by the subject\u2019s clinical state, environmental or \ntoxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. \n3.

It is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least \none of the following criteria: \n\u2013 is fatal; [results in death] [NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event] \n\u2013 is Life-Threatening [NOTE: the term \"Life-Threatening\" refers to an event in which \nthe patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to \nan event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe]. \n\u2013 requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n\u2013 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n\u2013 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; \n\u2013 is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the \noutcomes listed above \nMedical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited \nreporting to the sponsor is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical \nevents that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization \nbut may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes \nlisted in the definitions above. These situations should also usually be considered serious. \nExamples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for \nallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; \nor development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \nAn unexpected AE is one in which the nature or severity is not consistent with the \napplicable product information. \nCausality is initially assessed by the investigator.

It is thus recommended to \ncalibrate the measurement of serum creatinine against that of the MDRD core laboratory. 6 \nThe Roche Laboratory Data Manager will ensure that in collecting the normal ranges for each \nlaboratory participating in this study, there is an indication as to whether the serum creatinine \nresults will be calibrated or not. \nIt is also recommended to report serum creatinine values as mg/dL to 2 decimal places \n(e.g., 0.92 mg/dL instead of 0.9 mg/dL) and those reported as \u03bcmol/L should be reported as the \nnearest whole number (e.g., 109 \u03bcmol/L instead of 109.3 \u03bcmol/L). The GFR numeric estimate \nshould be rounded to the nearest whole number, such as \u201c35\u201d (mL/min/1.73 m2).3 The GFR \nnumeric estimate should not be corrected for body surface area. \n                                                 \n5 Myers GL, Miller WG, Coresh J et al.

MIRCERA and anti-erythropoietin-mediated pure red cell \naplasia (AEAB-mediated PRCA) \nMIRCERA is an erythropoietin-stimulating agent or ESA. \nA very rare side effect of ESAs is \u201canti-erythropoietin antibody-mediated pure red cell \naplasia\u201d or AEAB-mediated PRCA. \nThis side effect is an important identified risk in the EU risk management plan for \nMIRCERA. \n2. What is the objective of this educational program? \nThe objective of this booklet and the educational program is: \n\u2022 to increase early awareness and knowledge of AEAB-mediated PRCA associated \nwith ESAs \n\u2022 to encourage doctors to report adverse drug reactions to MIRCERA, especially \nAEAB-mediated PRCA  \n\u2022 to improve understanding of the importance of collecting detailed information on \nAEAB-mediated PRCA - through a questionnaire completed by the physician \n\u2022 to inform about Roche\u2019s offer for free antibody testing after having received a \nreport of a suspected case of AEAB-mediated PRCA. This includes where loss of \neffect of unknown cause is associated with MIRCERA.  \nFor full details on this topic, look at the MIRCERA Physician\u2019s Prescribing Information \n(Summary of Product Characteristics). Look in particular at the section:  \n\u2022 \u201cSpecial warnings and special precautions for use\u201d relating to important facts \nabout erythropoietin-stimulating agents / MIRCERA and AEAB-mediated \nPRCA. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 70 \n \n3. Loss of effect of ESA treatment \n3.1 If an ESA loses its effect, after having been effective in a patient what should \nI do? \nInvestigate the main possible causes: \n\u2022 haemolysis \n\u2022 malnutrition \n\u2022 iron deficiency \n\u2022 aluminium toxicity \n\u2022 chronic blood loss \n\u2022 inadequate dialysis \n\u2022 inflammatory disorders \n\u2022 multiple myeloma, myelofibrosis \n\u2022 other malignancies \n\u2022 hyperparathyroidism / osteitis fibrosa \n\u2022 vitamin deficiencies \u2013 such as folate or vitamin B12  \n\u2022 haemoglobinopathies \u2013 such as alpha- and beta-thalassemias or sickle cell anemia \n\u2022 adverse effects of concomitant drugs \u2013 such as cytotoxic and immunosuppressive \nagents and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. \nIf none of these conditions are diagnosed, anaemia should be fully investigated (see \nSection 5).  \n3.2 What are the most frequent causes? \nFor acquired PRCA, the following are the most frequent causes: \n\u2022 lymphoproliferative disorders \n\u2022 infections \u2013 such as parvovirus B19 \n\u2022 systemic autoimmune disease \u2013 such as systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis \n\u2022 drugs \u2013 such as azathioprine, isoniazid, phenytoin \n\u2022 thymoma - in about 5% of cases  \n\u2022 idiopathic - in about 50% of cases. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 71 \n \n \n4. What happens in AEAB-mediated PRCA? \nEpoetin permits terminal maturation of erythroid precursor cells and thus treats anemia \ndue to chronic kidney disease. AEAB-mediated PRCA is an acquired immune disease \nwhere erythropoiesis is inhibited by erythropoietin-specific neutralising antibodies. \n4.1 Findings in blood and bone marrow \nThe current diagnostic criteria for PRCA have been defined as:  \nfall in haemoglobin of about 0.1 g/dL/day \nreticulocyte count below 10 or 20x109/L \nno major changes in white cell count, platelet count, or differential leukocyte count \nnormal cellularity of bone marrow, less than 1% erythroblasts (occasionally up to 5% \nproerythroblasts or basophilic erythroblasts), normal myeloid cells and \nmegakaryocytes. \n4.2 Timing of onset \nThe shortest interval of onset of PRCA after treatment starts was reported within 2 \nmonths and the longest as 90 months. \n4.3 Discontinuation of ESAs \nThere is consensus that ESAs should be discontinued in any patient with confirmed \nAEAB-mediated PRCA. You should: \n\u2022 investigate for the presence of anti-erythropoietin antibodies  \n\u2022 perform a bone marrow examination.  \nPatients must not be switched to another recombinant ESA. This is because of cross-\nreactivity of antibodies with endogenous and all recombinant ESAs molecules. \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 72 \n5. Diagnosis of PRCA \n5.1 Haemoglobin drop \nEuropean Best Practice Guidelines suggest to strongly suspect PRCA if a patient treated \nwith an ESA: \n\u2022 has a sudden, rapid decline in Hb concentration of approximately 0.5-1 g/dL/week \ndespite ongoing ESA treatment or  \n\u2022 requires transfusions of 1-2 units of red blood cells per week to maintain the Hb \nlevel.  \nIn these cases, do a complete blood count with blood film examination and reticulocyte \ncount. A reticulocyte count below 10 or 20x109/L strongly suggests a PRCA.  \n5.2 Antibody testing \nOn request from a physician, Roche will offer testing or re-testing of serum samples in a \nreference laboratory. This is free of charge service for cases of suspected or confirmed \nAEAB-mediated PRCA or unexplained loss of effect (as documented in an ADR report \nand the questionnaire).  \nSampling instructions will be send to the physician, for details see Section 9 \u201cHow to \nobtain further information\u201d. \n5.3 Bone marrow examination \nA bone marrow examination should be triggered by a rapid and sustained decrease in the \nreticulocyte count.   \nPRCA is characterised by:  \n\u2022 normal cellularity \n\u2022 < 1% erythroblasts \n\u2022 occasionally erythroblasts up to 5% with evidence of a red cell precursor \nmaturation block \n\u2022 myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages are normal \nBone marrow findings help to distinguish PRCA from aplastic anaemia and \nmyelodysplastic syndrome. If no bone marrow examination is possible, a suspected \ndiagnosis could suffice, but the level of confidence of the diagnosis may be lower.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 73 \n \n6. Follow up after PRCA diagnosis \nYou should check reticulocyte count regularly during follow-up. This is the best \nlaboratory marker of red blood cell production. The reticulocyte count tells us about bone \nmarrow activity with regard to daily red cell production. A drop in haemoglobin will be \npreceded by a change in the rate of red cell production. An unchanged reticulocyte count \nsuggests that treatment is effective.  \nAny decline in reticulocyte count should be investigated. As one of the proposed \ndiagnostic criteria for AEAB-mediated PRCA an absolute reticulocyte count below 10 or \n20x109/L was suggested.  \n7. Adverse drug reaction reporting  \nWe need to know as much as possible about suspected case reports of AEAB-mediated \nPRCA potentially associated with MIRCERA treatment.  \nYou should consider an adverse drug reaction report where there are: \nconfirmed report of AEAB-mediated PRCA \u2013 such as positive AEAB findings or bone \nmarrow examination showing PRCA \nsuspected AEAB-mediated PRCA with insufficient or inconclusive results. This \nincludes follow-up on updated investigational results and updated results of \ncontinued monitoring of these patients \nreports of unexplained loss of effect, especially: \n\u2022 after excluding alternative causes of PRCA (see Section 3) \n\u2022 if a patient previously had a stable haemoglobin concentration after having \nhad established the MIRCERA dose (i.e. not during titration). Loss of effect \ncould be reflected by findings such as \u201crefractory anemia,\u201d massive dose \nincrease of the already established dose of MIRCERA, or a decrease in drug \neffect.  \nInvestigate through anti-erythropoietin antibody testing and haematological consultation \nin suspected AEAB-mediated PRCA or the unexplained loss of therapeutic effect.  \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 74 \n \n \n8. Questionnaire \nAfter receiving an adverse drug reaction report for AEAB-mediated PRCA or loss of \neffect, Roche will send the reporting physician a guided questionnaire.  \nThis questionnaire is called:  \n\u201cErythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs) questionnaire on  adverse event of \nanti-erythropoietin-mediated pure red cell aplasia, inadequate response to ESA \ntreatment, anemia refractory to ESA treatment, and unexplained loss of effect of \nESA treatment.\u201d  \nThe questionnaire will be updated with information already received.  \nIf appropriate, these collected data will support communication of a substantial change \n(e.g., via a label update).  \nThe questionnaire will collect data such as: \n\u2022 diagnostic results to confirm the diagnosis or clinical suspicion \n\u2022 relevant comorbidities or concomitant drugs \n\u2022 alternative conditions to explain a sudden drop in haemoglobin \n\u2022 exposure to epoetin brands with regard to the onset of first signs/symptoms \nsuggestive of AEAB-mediated PRCA.  \nThis guided questionnaire is only for when MIRCERA is used outside a clinical study. In \nclinical studies, the study protocol will guide how to follow up a report of potential \nAEAB-mediated PRCA or loss of effect. \n9.

A critical number of case reports are needed for a signal. Detection of rare \nadverse effects is increased and accelerated the more physicians contribute to spontaneous \nreporting of adverse reactions [Meyboom 1999]. According to Waller and Evans [2003], \nspontaneous adverse reaction reporting could be defined as an approach to collate \nindividual case reports of clinical suspicion of an adverse drug reaction with the main \naim of detecting unknown serious potential drug toxicity. The primary role of \nspontaneous reporting from post-marketing experience is signal generation for type \u2019A\u2019 \neffects (dose-related pharmacological effects of the drug) and type \u2018B\u2019 effects (e.g., allergic \nor idiosyncratic reactions, AEAB-mediated PRCA) [Meyboom 1999].   \nADR reporting for a drug newly introduced to the market is not only identification and \nquantification of unexpected adverse drug reactions but also the identification of \nsubgroups of patients at particular risk (e.g., related to comorbidities, age, gender, and \ndose). After introducing a drug to the market, safety is further continuously monitored to \nensure that the benefit/risk assessment remains acceptable and to communicate \nappropriate information to health professionals [Talbot 2004]. Spontaneous ADR \nreporting is understood as a cornerstone of pharmacovigilance [Waller 2003]. \nImportant facts about AEAB-mediated PRCA and ESAs \nAll exogenous proteins could be potentially immunogenic. With therapeutic proteins, the \nreported incidence of antibody formation varies considerably depending on, for example, \ngenetic background of the patient, the type of disease, type of protein, the route of \nadministration, dose frequency, and duration of treatment, in addition, manufacturing, \nhandling and storage might introduce contaminants, or alter the 3-dimensional structure \nof the protein via oxidation or aggregate formation [Schellekens 2002]. \n  \nDuring the first 10 years (1988\u20131998) of epoetin treatment, three reports of \nAEAB-mediated PRCA were published [Bergrem 1993, Peces 1996, Prabhakar 1997] \nreferring to treatment in several million patients. Since 1998, there had been a sudden \nupsurge of reports of AEAB-mediated PRCA in patients with chronic kidney disease. The \nmajority of these were reported in patients treated subcutaneously with the human serum \nalbumin-free epoetin alfa formulation marketed outside the U.S. (Eprex) with a peak in \nreports in 2001 and 2002 [Rossert 2004]. \n \nTesting approaches \nTwo testing approaches were utilised during the development program of MIRCERA and \nwill be applied for investigations for future post-marketing experience. The first test is a \nbridging ELISA test that is the method for quantification of anti-EPO antibodies and of \nanti-methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (anti-MIRCERA) antibodies. The second \ntype of testing is a neutralising antibody assay, which is a functional assay based on the \nuse of a standard in vitro assay to detect EPO or methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin \nCONFIDENTIAL Roche Protocol BH21260D (RO0503821) \u2013 Page 76 \nbeta activity. This assay measures EPO- or methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin \nbeta-stimulated proliferation of an EPO receptor-expressing cell line in the presence and \nabsence of patient serum. The presence of neutralizing anti-EPO or anti-methoxy \npolyethylene glycol-epoetin beta antibodies reduces or suppresses cell proliferation. This \nassay can optionally be applied to samples with discrepancies between antibody titer \ndetermined by antibody ELISA and clinical diagnosis. Since the antibody ELISA assays \nhave a several fold higher sensitivity compared with the neutralizing antibody assay, this \nassay is not expected to provide additional clinically relevant information for samples \nwith low antibody titers or confirmed PRCA. \nLiterature \nA brief summary indicates main aspects of the publications, which are grouped according \nto the aspect of practical and basic guidance on patient evaluation and detailed aspects of \nthe topic as briefly indicated in a summary for each publication. \nPractical and Basic Guidance on Patient Evaluation \n\u2022 Revised European Best Practice Guidelines on Anaemia Management (Section I. \nAnaemia evaluation) Nephrol Dial Transplant, 2004; 19(Suppl 2): ii2-ii5. \n\u2212 Which patients should be evaluated and when should the work-up begin. \n\u2212 Investigations for appropriate work-up of anaemia in CKD. \n\u2212 Diagnosis of renal anaemia. \n\u2022 Revised European Best Practice Guidelines on Anaemia Management (Section IV. \nFailure to respond to treatment) Nephrol Dial Transplant, 2004; 19(Suppl 2): \nii32-ii36. \n\u2212 Failure to reach or maintain target haemoglobin. \n\u2212 Criteria to suspect antierythropoetin-mediated pure red cell aplasia \n(AEAB-mediated PRCA). \n\u2212 Criteria to confirm AEAB-mediated PRCA. \n\u2022 Casadevall N., Cournoyer D., et al.
