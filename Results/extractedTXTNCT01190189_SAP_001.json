The mean age (plus range and standard deviation) of the enrolled subjects will be calculated. The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study sites will be tabulated. Analysis of safety No inferential analysis will be performed. Analyses of safety endpoints will only be descriptive. The proportion of subjects with at least one report of an SAE and/or at least one medically significant condition (including pIMDs) will be tabulated with exact 95% confidence interval (CI) throughout the study period.
