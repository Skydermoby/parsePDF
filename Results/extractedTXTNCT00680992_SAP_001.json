 Denosumab (AMG 162) \nStatistical Analysis Plan 20062004 \nDated:  17 July 2018 \nPage 6 \n3. \nStudy Overview \n3.1 \nStudy Design \nThis is a phase 2, international, multi-center, open-label study in subjects with GCTB, \nreceiving denosumab at a dose of 120 mg SC Q4W with a loading dose of 120 mg SC \non study days 8 and 15. \nThere are 3 cohorts in this study: \n\u2022\nCohort #1:  Subjects with surgically unsalvageable disease (eg, sacral, spinal GCTB,\nor multiple lesions including pulmonary metastases)\n\u2022\nCohort #2: Subjects with surgically salvageable disease whose planned initial\non-study surgery is associated with severe morbidity (eg, joint resection, limb\namputation, or hemipelvectomy)\n\u2022\nCohort #3: Subjects who are currently participating in Amgen study 20040215 giant\ncell tumor study who are eligible to enroll\n3.2 \nSample Size \nThe number of subjects in this study is governed by the number of GCTB subjects who \nqualify for the study.  It is anticipated that approximately 530 subjects will participate, \nand a minimum of 20 subjects will be skeletal mature adolescents.  Prior to \nAmendment 7, 510 subjects were enrolled.  Following Amendment 7, an additional \napproximately 20 subjects (approximately 10 adolescents and approximately 10 adults) \nwill be enrolled to the PK substudy. \nNo more than 30 subjects will enroll from the Amgen study 20040215.  No adolescents \nwill enroll into cohort 3, since all subjects participating in study 20040215 are adults \n(\u2265 18 years of age). \nSubjects will continue to receive denosumab Q4W until one of the following occurs: \n\u2022\nFor subjects with a complete tumor resection, denosumab treatment continues for\n6 doses after pathological confirmation of partial response or complete response.\n\u2022\nIn all other cases, denosumab treatment continues until confirmation of disease\nprogression, investigator\u2019s recommendation of discontinuation, Amgen\u2019s and Daiichi\nSankyo Co., Ltd\u2019s. (for Japanese sites only) recommendation of discontinuation, the\nsubject\u2019s decision to discontinue for any reason, or administration of any of the\nproscribed therapies.\nIn the protocol dated 15 Dec 2017, data (treatment plus follow up) will be collected \nfor all subjects enrolled until the end of the clinical study.  This is anticipated to \nbe when subjects enrolled prior to a minimum of 60 months or until death or lost \nto follow-up, whichever comes first.

For an individual, if multiple imaging studies are present, the best \nresponse prior to on-study GCTB surgery (for subjects undergoing surgery) or \nprior to the end of initial treatment phase (for subjects without on-study surgery) \nwill be used. \nDisease Status Changes \nIt is categorized as complete response, partial response, stable disease and disease \nprogression by the physician\u2019s assessment. \nTime to Pain Score Change \nIt is defined as the time interval (in days) from the first dose date to the date of clinical \nmeaningful pain score change (2-point decrease).  If a subject has a GCTB surgery, pain \nscore after GCTB surgery will be censored.  If a subject has not had clinical meaningful \npain score change by on-study GCTB surgery date or final database lock, time to pain \nscore change will be censored at her/his end of initial treatment phase date or on-\nstudy GCTB surgery date. \n7. \nAnalysis Subsets \n7.1 \nSafety Analysis Set \nThe safety analysis set, for adverse events and lab parameters, includes all enrolled \nsubjects who received at least one dose of IP on 20062004 study. \n7.2 \nEfficacy Analysis Set \nThe efficacy analysis set included all enrolled subjects who were eligible for the study, \nand received at least one dose of IP on 20062004 study.  Subjects with key \ninclusion/exclusion deviations of the eligibility criteria \u2018pathologically confirmed \ngiant cell tumor\u2019 and/or \u2018known or suspected diagnosis of underlying malignancy\u2019 \nwere excluded from the efficacy analysis set.  Subjects who rolled over from \nStudy 20040215 to the safety follow-up phase in Study 20062004 and later \nreceived retreatment were also excluded from the efficacy analysis set.   \n7.3 \nPatient Reported Outcome (PRO) Analysis Set \nIncludes all subjects in the efficacy analysis set who had at least one PRO assessment \nand used consistent recall periods throughout the study.   \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nStatistical Analysis Plan 20062004 \nDated:  17 July 2018 \nPage 17 \n7.4 \nPK Analysis Set \n Includes all subjects who received at least one dose of IP with baseline PK \nmeasurement and at least one post-baseline PK measurement. \n7.5 \nInterim Analyses Set \nThe Safety/Efficacy/PRO Analysis Sets are the respective analysis sets of all enrolled \nsubjects up to the time of the interim analyses.  The safety analysis set includes all \nenrolled subjects who received at least one dose of IP by the interim analysis cut-off \ndate.  The efficacy analysis set includes all enrolled subjects who were eligible for the \nstudy and received at least one dose of IP by the interim analysis cut-off date.  The PRO \nanalysis set includes all subjects in the efficacy analysis set who had at least one PRO \nassessment by the interim analysis cut-off date.   \n8. \nInterim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines  \nThe first and second interim analyses were conducted after 50 and 100 subjects, \nrespectively, had the opportunity to complete 6 months of treatment.  The third interim \nanalysis was conducted with a data cut-off date of 25 March 2011 and included \napproximately 286 subjects enrolled.  An independent analysis of the radiographic \nimages retrospectively collected for the study up to March 25, 2011, the data cutoff date \nfor the CSR to be included in the GCTB filing, was performed.  An external radiology \nvendor was selected for this retrospective radiographic image review.  For analysis \ndetails and results, please see GCTB CSE SAP and the report on the integrated \nradiology assessments.  An unplanned analysis based on agency\u2019s requested was \nperformed based on the data cutoff date of August 30, 2013.  In addition, a planned \nprimary analysis was conducted after subjects enrolled to the Pharmacokinetic \nSub Study had an opportunity to complete 12 months of treatment (data cut-off on \n24 Feb 2017). \n9. \nData Screening and Acceptance \n9.1 \nData Handling and Electronic Transfer of Data \nAll data for this study will be received from Amgen\u2019s data management department.  For \nstudies in RAVE, since RAVE has no snapshot function, the study team will specify \ncriteria to subset data for interim analysis.   \n9.2 \nHandling of Missing and Incomplete Data \nSubjects may have missing data points for a variety of reasons.  In general, data may be \nmissing due to subject\u2019s early withdrawal from study, a missed visit, or non-evaluability \nof an endpoint at a particular point in time.  For the primary outcome, no imputation will \n",
