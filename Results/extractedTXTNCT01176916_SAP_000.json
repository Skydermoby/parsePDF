        "Content": "Note: in this document any text copied directly from the protocol is italicised.Aromasin\u00ae (Exemestane) is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inhibitor, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. In post-menopausal women, oestrogens are produced primarily from the conversion of androgens into oestrogens through the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Oestrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In the year 2002, Aromasin\u00ae (Exemestane) was approved in China for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women with natural or induced postmenopausal status whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.Aromasin\u00ae (Exemestane) was approved in China for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausalwomen with estrogen receptor (ER) positive early invasive breast cancer who have received2-3 years of tamoxifen & are switched to Aromasin\u00ae for completion of a total of 5 consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy by State Food and Drug Administration(CFDA) with clinical trial waive in May. 2008. The approval was granted in view of thesignificant efficacy and tolerant safety from the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES), whichwas a phase III randomized controlled trial conducted primarily in Caucasian patients.While Aromasin\u00ae has been used in China for adjuvant therapy of breast cancer since then,there is currently lack of systematic collection and analysis for the efficacy and safety data ofAromasin\u00ae adjuvant setting in Chinese population. The Aromasin\u00ae Non-Interventional Study is being proposed to collect data systematically and to assess the efficacy and safety ofAromasin\u00ae adjuvant setting in Chinese population. Generation of such information isexpected to provide evidence for Chinese physicians to manage clinical practice ofAromasin\u00ae adjuvant setting. The safety document will be used in this study is the Aromasin\u00ae Local Product Document approved by CFDA.",
