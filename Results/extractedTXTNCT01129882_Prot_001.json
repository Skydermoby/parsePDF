Subjectscan receive this treatment until aripiprazole IM Depot is commercially available in any dosage (including generic formulation[s]) in the country that the study is being conducted or until the study end date of 31 Dec 2018 is reached.The secondary objective is to collect long-term safety data on aripiprazole IM Depot in addition to what was collected in Study 248 (52-weeks).Trial Design:This is an open-label, multicenter rollover non-comparative trial designed to continue to provide aripiprazole IM Depot (400 mg or 300 mg) to adult subjects with schizophrenia who completed aripiprazole IM Depot treatment in Study 248.  The decision to enroll into the long-term open-label study will be a joint decision by the investigator and subject.  No subjects who discontinued or did not complete Study 248 are allowed to enroll in Study 31-10-270 (hereafter referred to as Study 270).Eligible subjects will enter this study directly after completing the End ofTreatment visit (Week 52) of Study 248.  The End of Treatment evaluations conducted at the last study visit for Study 248 will serve as the baseline evaluations for Study 270.  Subjects in this study will continue to receive aripiprazole IM Depot every month (study months are every 4 weeks which is defined as 28 [\u22122/+10] days) as a continuation of their previous monthly dose in Study 248.  The minimum interval of 26 days and maximum interval of 38 days between injections is to ensure that therapeutic plasma concentrations of aripiprazole are maintained.  The monthly dose can be modified, either reduced from 400 mg to 300 mg to address tolerability or increased from 300 mg to 400 mg to address efficacy, at the discretion of the investigator.Following the baseline visit, subjects will receive monthly injections and at the same visit, adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be recorded and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will be completed.  Every 3 months, all of the monthly assessments will be completed along with a urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP).  Every 6 months, all of the 3-month assessments will be completed along with the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale, vital signs, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) assessments (including the Abnormal Until the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 31-10-27016.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments3Protocol 31-10-270\nConfidential - Otsuka Proprietary Information\n4\n08 Jul 2015\nInvoluntary Movement Scale [AIMS], Simpson-Angus Scale [SAS], and \nBarnes Akathisia Rating Scale [BARS]).  At the 12-month visit, all of the \n6-month assessments will be completed along with clinical laboratory tests \nand assessments of body weight, height, and waist circumference.  \nUrine drug screening and blood alcohol testing will be obtained at baseline \nand can be re-obtained at the investigator\u2019s discretion at any time during the \nstudy.  A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for subject-reported rating of pain at \nthe most recent injection site and the investigator\u2019s assessment for pain, \nredness, induration, and swelling of the most recent injection site will be \nperformed at baseline and may be reassessed at the discretion of the \ninvestigator.  Clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, and \nelectrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at baseline may also be performed at the \ndiscretion of the investigator based on clinical necessity.  \nA Study Completion visit or Early Termination visit (\u22122/+10 days) will \ninclude the following assessments: C-SSRS, AEs, concomitant medications, a \nurine pregnancy test for WOCBP, CGI-S, vital signs, EPS assessments \n(AIMS, BARS, SAS), clinical laboratory tests, and body height and weight.\nA 30-Day Post Treatment Follow-up phone call will be made 30 days \n(\uf0b13 days) after it has been determined that the subject will no longer \nparticipate in this study and will include questions about any AEs that have \noccurred and any concomitant medications taken since the last visit.\nNo oral antipsychotic rescue medication (including aripiprazole) is allowed in \nthis study.  If a subject experiences an exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, \nthe investigator should assess the suitability of the subject\u2019s continuation in \nthe study and ensure that the subject is treated appropriately.  If the \ninvestigator deems that other antipsychotic therapy is warranted, the subject\nshould be discontinued from this study.\nAripiprazole IM Depot treatment in this open-label rollover study will \ncontinue until there are clinical and/or administrative reasons for \ndiscontinuation of the subject\u2019s study treatment or until the study end date of \n31 Dec 2018 is reached, whichever occurs first.  \nClinical reasons for discontinuing study treatment include, but are not limited \nto: the subject voluntarily withdrawing consent; the subject becoming lost to \nfollow-up; if a subject misses 2 consecutive injections at any time in the \nstudy or if a subject misses 3 injections in a 52-week time period; or the \ninvestigator determines that the subject is no longer receiving benefit from \naripiprazole IM Depot.  Administrative reasons for discontinuing study \ntreatment include, but are not limited to: aripiprazole IM Depot becomes\ncommercially available in any dosage (including a generic formulation) in the \ncountry where the study is being conducted, the commercial availability of \naripiprazole IM Depot is terminated by the sponsor, or until the study end \ndate of 31 Dec 2018 is reached, whichever occurs first.  \nOnce aripiprazole IM Depot becomes commercially available in any dosage \n(including generic formulation[s]) in the country where the subject is \nparticipating in the study or the commercial availability of aripiprazole \nIM Depot is terminated by the sponsor, study treatment will be discontinued \nwithin approximately 6 weeks of the subject\u2019s previous injection for clinical \ntransition purposes.\nIf the sponsor terminates the study prior to 31 Dec 2018 for any reason other \nthan commercial availability, investigators in some countries where the \nsponsor has limited or delayed commercialization plans, or where no \nUntil the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka \nconfidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.\nClinical Study Report 31-10-270\n16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments\n4\nProtocol 31-10-270\nConfidential - Otsuka Proprietary Information\n5\n08 Jul 2015\ncommercialization activity is anticipated, may be eligible to participate in a \nmanaged access program until aripiprazole IM Depot is commercially \navailable in their country or until 31 Dec 2018.\nSubject Population:\nThe subject population will be comprised of subjects who have completed \nStudy 248 and in the investigator\u2019s judgment may benefit from continued \nparticipation in an aripiprazole IM Depot study, in countries where \naripiprazole IM Depot is not commercially available.\nIt is anticipated that approximately 500 to 800 subjects from Study 248 will \nenroll in this study.\nInclusion/Exclusion \nCriteria:\nSubjects enrolling into Study 270 from Study 248 will have fulfilled the \ninclusion and exclusion criteria for Study 248.\nA complete list and description of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided \nin Section 3.4.\nKey inclusion criteria for Study 270 include subjects with a current diagnosis \nof schizophrenia, (as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR] criteria), who \ncompleted the open-label extension Study 248; subjects who, in the \ninvestigator\u2019s judgment, may benefit from continued participation in \naripiprazole IM Depot study; and subjects who have an outpatient status.  The \nbaseline visit for Study 270 (which is the Week 52 visit of Study 248) and the \nfirst injection for Study 270 must occur within 4 weeks (which is defined as \n28 [\u22122/+10] days) of the last injection in Study 248.\nKey exclusion criteria include subjects with a current DSM-IV-TR diagnosis \nother than schizophrenia, including schizoaffective disorder, major \ndepressive disorder, bipolar disorder, delirium, dementia, amnestic or other \ncognitive disorders; subjects who are known to be allergic, intolerant, or \nunresponsive to prior treatment with aripiprazole or other  quinolinones; \ndependence on substances of abuse; a history of violent behavior, seizures, \nneuroleptic malignant syndrome, clinically significant tardive dyskinesia, or \nother medical condition that would expose the subject to undue risk or \ninterfere with study assessments; involuntary incarceration; electroconvulsive \ntherapy within 180 days prior to entry; clinically significant abnormalities in \nlaboratory test results, vital signs, or ECG results; require hospitalization; \nmay require any other antipsychotic medication, varenicline, cytochrome \nP450 (CYP) 2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors, or CYP3A4 inducers during the \nstudy; and if aripiprazole IM Depot (including generic formulation) is \ncommercially available in the country where the study is being conducted.\nTrial Site(s):\nApproximately 250 sites globally (the number of sites globally in Study 248).  \nNew sites will not be used.\nInvestigational Medicinal \nProduct(s), Dose, Dosage \nregimen, Treatment \nperiod, Formulation, \nMode of Administration:\nThe investigational products will be aripiprazole IM Depot 400 mg supplied \nas lyophilized vials.  Both doses of aripiprazole IM Depot used in this trial \n(400 mg and 300 mg) will be obtained from the 400-mg lyophilized vials.  \nIM Depot will be administered every month (study months are every 4 weeks \nwhich is defined as 28 [\u22122/+10] days).  All doses of IM Depot must be \ninjected into the gluteal muscle, and care must be taken to avoid inadvertent \ninjection into a blood vessel.\nUntil the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka \nconfidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.\nClinical Study Report 31-10-270\n16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments\n5\nProtocol 31-10-270\nConfidential - Otsuka Proprietary Information\n6\n08 Jul 2015\nTrial Assessments:\nSafety:  Safety will be assessed by adverse event and concomitant \nmedication reporting at baseline (post-IM administration) and at each \nsubsequent monthly injection visit (study months are every 4 weeks which is \ndefined as 28 [\u22122/+10] days).  The C-SSRS will be used to assess suicidality \nat baseline and at each subsequent monthly injection visit.  Extrapyramidal \nsymptoms will be assessed using the AIMS, SAS, and BARS assessment \nquestionnaires at baseline, every 6 months, at the discretion of the \ninvestigator at any subsequent visit, and at Study Completion or the \nEarly Termination visit.  Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at \nbaseline, every 12 months, and at Study Completion or the Early Termination\nvisit.  Vital signs will be assessed every 6 months and at Study Completion or \nthe Early Termination visit.  Body height and weight, body mass index \n(BMI), and waist circumference will be assessed at baseline; body height, \nweight, and waist circumference will be reassessed every 12 months; and \nbody height and weight will be assessed at Study Completion or the \nEarly Termination visit.  For WOCBP, a urine pregnancy test will be \nadministered at baseline, every 3 months, and at Study Completion or the \nEarly Termination visit. \nEfficacy:  Efficacy will be evaluated using the CGI-S administered every \n6 months.\nCriteria for Evaluation:\nSafety Endpoints:  \n\uf0b7\nFrequency and severity of adverse events, serious adverse events \n(clinical and laboratory) and discontinuations from the study due to \nadverse events.\n\uf0b7\nSuicide risk as assessed and classified by the C-SSRS.\n\uf0b7\nExtrapyramidal symptoms will be evaluated by calculating the mean \nchange from baseline in AIMS, SAS, and BARS.\n\uf0b7\nThe incidence of clinically significant changes will be calculated for \nvital signs.  Mean change from baseline and incidence of clinically \nsignificant changes will be calculated for body weight and waist \ncircumference.  \nEfficacy Endpoint: \n\uf0b7\nCGI-S score will be evaluated by calculating mean change from baseline.\nStatistical Methods:\nDue to the open-label single-arm nature of the study, all data on safety and \nefficacy/outcome will be summarized by descriptive statistics (eg, mean, \nstandard deviation, maximum, minimum, and proportions).\nTrial Duration:\nSubjects will continue to receive aripiprazole IM Depot in this open-label \nrollover study until there are clinical and/or administrative reasons for \ndiscontinuation of the subject\u2019s study treatment or until the study end date of \n31 Dec 2018 is reached, whichever occurs first (see \u201cTrial Design\u201d section \nabove).  \nOnce aripiprazole becomes available commercially at any dosage (including \ngeneric formulation[s]) in the country where the study is being conducted, the \ncommercial availability of aripiprazole IM Depot is terminated by the \nsponsor, or until the study end date of 31 Dec 2018 is reached, treatment will \nbe discontinued.  If aripiprazole IM Depot is commercially available or if the \navailability of aripiprazole IM Depot is terminated by the sponsor, then the \nsubject will discontinue treatment within approximately 6 weeks of last \ninjection for clinical transition purposes.\nUntil the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka \nconfidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.\nClinical Study Report 31-10-270\n16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments\n6\nProtocol 31-10-270Confidential - Otsuka Proprietary Information708 Jul 2015Protocol Synopsis...........................................................................................3",

The aripiprazole \nimmediate-release IM injection formulation is approved for the treatment of agitation \nassociated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania in the US and EU.  In addition, an oral \nsolution formulation and orally disintegrating (dispersible) tablets have been approved \nand marketed in the US and EU.  \nThe favorable side effect profile of oral aripiprazole, including its low incidence of EPS, \nlow risk of prolactin elevation, decreased adrenergic and anticholinergic side effects, and \nminimal weight gain, makes it an excellent candidate for a long-acting depot formulation.  \nAripiprazole IM depot formulation is currently being developed for maintenance \ntreatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder, and was approved for the treatment of \nschizophrenia in the US in February 2013.  Its efficacy was demonstrated in a pivotal \nphase 3 registrational trial (Study 31-07-246) designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, \nand tolerability of the long-acting IM depot formulation of aripiprazole administered to \nadult subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined by the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).  \nA marketing application was submitted in September 2011 to the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) for use of the aripiprazole IM depot formulation as maintenance \ntreatment in patients with schizophrenia, which was approved in February 2013\n(Appendix 13).  A marketing application was submitted in December 2012 to the \nEuropean Medicines Agency.  \nStudy 31-08-248 is included in the development plan for aripiprazole IM Depot to \nsupplement the safety data that will be generated as part of the phase 3 program and to \nprovide additional efficacy data for the maintenance treatment of patients with \nschizophrenia.  The current study (31-10-270, hereafter referred to as Study 270), will \nallow subjects who completed Study 31-08-248 (hereafter referred to as Study 248) to \ncontinue treatment with aripiprazole IM Depot until it is commercially available in any \ndosage (including generic formulation[s]) in the country where the study is being \nconducted, the commercial availability of aripiprazole IM Depot is terminated by the \nUntil the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka \nconfidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.\nClinical Study Report 31-10-270\n16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments\n17\n",

Systemic \nexposures to aripiprazole were dose-related and generally higher in females than in \nmales.  Plasma concentrations of aripiprazole were measurable at all doses up to Day 43 \nin rats (maximum plasma concentration [Cmax] approximately 190 ng/mL at 1 mg/kg)10\nand Day 42 in dogs (Cmax approximately 30 ng/mL, area under the concentration curve \n[AUC]0-28 days approximately 300 ng-days/mL at 100 mg/dog),11 indicating sustained \nabsorption over these periods.  Clinically relevant exposures were not readily achieved in \nrats or dogs due to the markedly greater metabolic clearance of aripiprazole in animals \nversus humans, and because release of drug from the injection site, as desired, was slow.  \nPlasma concentrations of the pharmacologically active metabolite, BMS-337040, were \ngenerally below the lower limit of quantitation in both species, whereas plasma \nconcentrations of BMS-337044 (dehydro-aripiprazole, another active metabolite) were \nmeasurable at most time points in dogs, but not in rats. \nThe IM depot formulation was well tolerated by all species; the principal gross finding at \ninjection sites was generally dose-related, linear foci of white or tan discoloration in \nskeletal muscle that slowly decreased in size over time. Microscopically, the foci of \nwhite/tan discoloration were characterized as a localized and generally dose-dependent \nforeign-body type of granulomatous inflammation (minimal to mild in rats; minimal to \nmoderate in rabbits and dogs) associated with deposits of drug (birefringent polymorphic \ncrystalline material) that remained localized at the injection site.  As is characteristic of a \nforeign-body reaction, resolution of the granulomatous inflammation at injection sites \nwas slow, and recovery was incomplete by Day 43 and 45 postdose in dogs and rats, \nrespectively, and by Day 57 postdose in rabbits.\nPivotal nonclinical studies to support the IM depot formulation for clinical use included \nsingle-dose IM irritation and toxicity studies in rats (0, 75, or 100 mg/kg), rabbits (0, 150, \nor 200 mg), and dogs (0, 150, 200, 300, or 400 mg), and repeated-dose toxicity studies in \nrats (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg weekly for 26 weeks) and beagle dogs (0, 10, 20, and \n40 mg/kg weekly for 26 weeks).  All doses of this IM depot formulation were well \ntolerated by all species.  As with the earlier IM irritation and toxicity studies, the \nprincipal injection site findings in all species were deposits of drug that remained \nlocalized at the injection site and associated foreign-body type of granulomatous \ninflammation, both of which resolved slowly over time.

Review of the data from these trials indicated that all of the \ndoses of aripiprazole were effective in the treatment of acute psychosis.  All aripiprazole \ndoses were statistically significant compared to placebo with regard to the primary \nendpoints of change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale \n(PANSS) Total Score, PANSS positive score, and Clinical Global Impression - Severity \n(CGI-S) score.  As expected, the active comparators (haloperidol and risperidone), \ndemonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of psychosis as measured by these endpoints.  \nThe third double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (CN138001)14 was 6 weeks in \nduration and included aripiprazole oral doses of 10, 15, and 20 mg/day.  All doses of \naripiprazole demonstrated significant improvement compared with placebo for change \nfrom baseline in the PANSS Total Score and the positive and negative subscales.  \nThree phase 3, double-blind, controlled studies were conducted to show the long-term \nefficacy of aripiprazole.  Study CN13804715,16 was a 26-week study designed to \ndocument the long-term efficacy of oral aripiprazole 15 mg/day compared with placebo \nin stable schizophrenic subjects.  The primary efficacy variable was time to relapse from \nrandomization, as measured by Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) score \n\u2265 5, PANSS scores for hostility or uncooperativeness \u22655, or \u2265 20% increase in PANSS \nTotal Score.  The results indicated that subjects treated with aripiprazole 15 mg daily \nexperienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the 26-week assessment period \ncompared with those receiving placebo.  Two 52-week studies (Studies 31-98-217 and \n31-98-304-01)17,18 of aripiprazole 30 mg versus haloperidol 10 mg were conducted in \nacutely relapsing schizophrenic subjects with the intention of pooling the data for \nanalysis.  On the primary efficacy measure (time to failure to maintain response in \nresponders) no difference was seen between aripiprazole and haloperidol.  However, \nanalysis of secondary efficacy measures showed that aripiprazole 30 mg was superior to \nhaloperidol on negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, and discontinuation for any \nreason.\nThe subject-rated and investigator-rated acceptability of aripiprazole treatment has been \nexamined in open-label studies.  Subjects treated with open-label oral aripiprazole 10 to \n30 mg for 8 weeks indicated a general preference for aripiprazole over the antipsychotic \nmedication(s) taken prior to entering the study (CN138087 and CN138100).

Additionally, aripiprazole exhibited a more favorable safety \nprofile than haloperidol in the 26-week active-controlled study in acute bipolar mania.  \nThe safety profile was consistent with that observed in haloperidol-controlled \nschizophrenia studies, as evidenced by a lower incidence of AE discontinuation;\nEPS-related AEs, and prolactin elevation.22\nHyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar \ncoma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.  There \nhave been few reports of hyperglycemia in subjects treated with aripiprazole.  Although \nfewer subjects have been treated with aripiprazole, it is not known if this more limited\nexperience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports.  Assessment of the \nrelationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated \nby the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in subjects with \nschizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population.  \nGiven these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and \nhyperglycemia-related AEs is not completely understood.  However, epidemiological \nstudies which did not include aripiprazole suggest an increased risk of \ntreatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related AEs in subjects treated with the atypical \nantipsychotics included in these studies.  Because aripiprazole was not marketed at the \ntime these studies were performed, it is not known if aripiprazole is associated with this \nincreased risk.  Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related AEs in subjects treated \nwith atypical antipsychotics are not available.\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic \ndrugs, including aripiprazole, are at an increased risk of death compared with placebo.  \nOver the course of three 10-week, placebo-controlled studies of aripiprazole in elderly \nsubjects with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the rate of death in \naripiprazole-treated subjects was 3.5%, compared with a rate of 1.7% in the placebo \ngroup during or within 30 days after termination from the double-blind phase of the \nstudies.  Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths were either \ncardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature.  \nOverall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated subjects reported cerebrovascular AEs (eg, stroke, \ntransient ischemic attack) compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated subjects in these trials.  \nThis difference was not statistically significant.  However, in one of these trials, a \nfixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose-response relationship for cerebrovascular \nAEs in subjects treated with aripiprazole.  Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment \nof dementia-related psychosis.

If this laboratory value is determined by the investigator \nto be an abnormal change from baseline for that subject, this is considered an AE.\nSeverity: AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated on the CRF.\nThe intensity of an adverse experience is defined as follows:\n1 = Mild:\nDiscomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.\n2 = Moderate:\nDiscomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.\n3 = Severe:\nInability to work or perform normal daily activity.  \nThe causal relationship of the study drug to an AE is assessed as related or unrelated, as \nfollows:\nRelated:\nDefinite:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and \nthe AE or the event responds to withdrawal of the study drug (dechallenge) and \nthe Investigator\u2019s assessment of the event is deemed \u201cDefinitely Related\u201d based \non the sum of available clinical information gathered.\nProbable:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and \nthe AE.  The event may respond to dechallenge or the Investigator\u2019s assessment \nof the event is deemed \u201cProbably Related\u201d based on the sum of available clinical \ninformation gathered.\nPossible:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and \nthe AE.  Dechallenge is lacking or unclear and the Investigator\u2019s assessment of \nthe event is deemed \u201cPossibly Related\u201d based on the sum of clinical information \ngathered.\nUntil the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka \nconfidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.\nClinical Study Report 31-10-270\n16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments\n52\n",

Behavior was in part \nthought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated \nwith the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or \nharm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no \ninjury results, this is considered an attempt.  \nInferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or \ncircumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be \ninferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, \nbut they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. \nHave you made a suicide attempt?\nHave you done anything to harm yourself?\nHave you done anything dangerous where you could have died?\nWhat did you do?\nDid you______ as a way to end your life? \nDid you want to die (even a little) when you_____? \nWere you trying to end your life when you _____?\nOr did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?\nOr did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to \nrelieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an \nattempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by \nsomeone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, \nit is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has \nnoose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.\nHas there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or \nsomething stopped you before you actually did anything?\nIf yes, describe:\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nTotal # of \ninterrupted\n______\nAborted Attempt:  \nWhen person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops themselves before they actually have \nengaged in any self-destructive behavior. Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, except that the individual \nstops him/herself, instead of being stopped by something else.\nHas there been a time when you started to do something to try to end your life but you \nstopped yourself before you actually did anything?\nIf yes, describe:\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nTotal # of\naborted\n______\nPreparatory Acts or Behavior:\nActs or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a verbalization \nor thought, such as assembling a specific method (e.g. buying pills, purchasing a gun) or preparing for one\u2019s death \nby suicide (e.g. giving things away, writing a suicide note). \nHave you taken any steps towards making a suicide attempt or preparing to kill yourself (such \nas collecting pills, getting a gun, giving valuables away or writing a suicide note)?\nIf yes, describe:\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nSuicidal Behavior:\nSuicidal behavior was present during the assessment period?\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nUntil the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka \nconfidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.\nClinical Study Report 31-10-270\n16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments\n81\nProtocol 31-10-270\nConfidential - Otsuka Proprietary Information\n82\n08 Jul 2015\nAnswer for Actual Attempts Only\nMost Recent \nAttempt\nDate:\nMost Lethal          \nAttempt\nDate:\nInitial/First \nAttempt\nDate:\nActual Lethality/Medical Damage:  \n0.

Behavior was in part \nthought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated \nwith the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or \nharm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no \ninjury results, this is considered an attempt.  \nInferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or \ncircumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be \ninferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, \nbut they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. \nHave you made a suicide attempt?\nHave you done anything to harm yourself?\nHave you done anything dangerous where you could have died?\nWhat did you do?\nDid you______ as a way to end your life? \nDid you want to die (even a little) when you_____? \nWere you trying to end your life when you _____?\nOr did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?\nOr did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to \nrelieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious Behavior \nwithout suicidal intent)\nIf yes, describe:\nHas subject engaged in Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior?\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nTotal # of\nAttempts\n______\nYes     No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nInterrupted Attempt:  \nWhen the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if not \nfor that, actual attempt would have occurred).\nOverdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an \nattempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by \nsomeone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, \nit is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has \nnoose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.\nHas there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or \nsomething stopped you before you actually did anything?\nIf yes, describe:\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nTotal # of \ninterrupted\n______\nAborted Attempt:  \nWhen person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops themselves before they actually have \nengaged in any self-destructive behavior. Examples are similar to interrupted attempts, except that the individual \nstops him/herself, instead of being stopped by something else.\nHas there been a time when you started to do something to try to end your life but you \nstopped yourself before you actually did anything?\nIf yes, describe:\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nTotal # of\naborted\n______\nPreparatory Acts or Behavior:\nActs or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a verbalization \nor thought, such as assembling a specific method (e.g. buying pills, purchasing a gun) or preparing for one\u2019s death \nby suicide (e.g. giving things away, writing a suicide note). \nHave you taken any steps towards making a suicide attempt or preparing to kill yourself (such \nas collecting pills, getting a gun, giving valuables away or writing a suicide note)?\nIf yes, describe:\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nSuicidal Behavior:\nSuicidal behavior was present during the assessment period?\nYes      No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nCompleted Suicide:\n   Yes    No\n\u25a1   \u25a1\nUntil the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka \nconfidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.\nClinical Study Report 31-10-270\n16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments\n86\nProtocol 31-10-270\nConfidential - Otsuka Proprietary Information\n87\n08 Jul 2015\nAnswer for Actual Attempts Only\nMost Lethal \nAttempt\nActual Lethality/Medical Damage:  \n0.  No physical damage or very minor physical damage (e.g. surface scratches).\n1.  Minor physical damage (e.g. lethargic speech; first-degree burns; mild bleeding; sprains).\n2.  Moderate physical damage; medical attention needed (e.g. conscious but sleepy, somewhat responsive; \nsecond-degree burns; bleeding of major vessel).\n3.  Moderately severe physical damage; medical hospitalization and likely intensive care required (e.g. \ncomatose with reflexes intact; third-degree burns less than 20% of body; extensive blood loss but \ncan recover; major fractures).\n4.
