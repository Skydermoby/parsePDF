Of these, approximately \n175 study participants are expected to return and provide information on antibody persistence after the first \nbooster vaccination with either FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior or FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml. With this sample \nsize, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the seropositivity rate will extend no more than 5.8% from the \nobserved rate assuming the observed rate lies in the region of 90%.\nPlanned Statistical Analysis\nPoint estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the seropositivity rate at each time point when blood is \ndrawn after the booster vaccination in Study 700401 and separately at each time point after the booster \nvaccination in this study as measured by NT will be calculated.\nThe dependence of seropositivity of study participants on demographic factors (age, weight, gender) at \nyearly intervals from approximately 3 years (38 months) to 10 years (118 months) after the first booster \nvaccination will be analyzed by logistic regression at the end of the study period.\nFSME-IMMUN\nB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)\nProtocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015\n9\nThe antibody levels as measured by NT and ELISA at each blood draw after the first booster will be used \nto determine the annual decline rate.\nThe analysis of immunogenicity before the second booster vaccination will be carried out separately in the \nthree age classes defined previously in Study 209. Subjects will remain in the same age class they were \nassigned to at the beginning of Study 209 (1 - 2 years, 3 \u2013 6 years, 7 \u2013 15 years). For the analysis of \nimmunogenicity and safety after the booster vaccination the oldest age class will be further divided into \nthose who received FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior and those who received FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml.\nThe occurrence of fever and the 95% confidence interval of the probability of occurrence will be given. \nThe fever rate after the second booster vaccination will be categorized by severity grade.\nLocal and systemic reaction rates, other than fever, after the booster vaccination will be provided in tabular \nformat, and the probabilities of the occurrence of the adverse event (AE) rates and their 95% confidence \nintervals will be calculated.\nFor each symptom queried in the Subject Diary, the number of subjects who experienced the symptom, as \nwell as the probabilities of the occurrence and the 95% confidence interval will be given. \nFSME-IMMUNB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)Protocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015101.

        "Content": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is a member of the family Flaviviridae, which comprises approximately 70 different viruses that cause many serious diseases in a wide variety of vertebrates, including humans. Among the flaviviruses, TBE virus has one of the highest impacts as a human pathogen, as indicated by the disease prevalence in endemic areas in certain parts of Europe and the East. The clinical course of the disease is largely determined by TBE virus subtype. By sequence analysis of TBE virus isolates from different endemic areas, three subtypes of the virus have been identified: Far-Eastern, Siberian and European/Western.2;3The distribution of the TBE virus covers almost the entire southern part of the nontropical Eurasian forest belt, from Alsace Lorraine in the west to Vladivostok and northern and eastern regions of China in the east through to Hokkaido in Japan. In Europe, changes in the endemicity of TBE have recently been observed: several new TBE foci have been found or rediscovered in the Nordic countries, such as Bornholm in Denmark, southern Norway and several foci in the south of Sweden.4;5In Europe, eight species of ticks, the main vector for the disease, have been identified so far that are capable of transmitting TBE virus. Ixodes ricinus, the common castor bean tick, is the primary vector and thus is mainly responsible for the spread of the virus in western and central Europe and the European region of Russia.6",

                        "Content": "After Lyme disease, TBE is the most prevalent tick-transmitted disease in Europe.7 The typical course of the Western subtype is biphasic and can be outlined as follows: the incubation period, which is clinically silent, may last between 2 and 28 days 8, but in most cases it lasts approximately 8 days.9 The first stage, which may last for 1 to 8 days, corresponds to the viremic phase. Exceptionally high initial fevers may occasionally occur, rising as high as 40.9\u00b0C.10;11 These may be accompanied by headache, malaise and muscle pain, lasting about 4 days.12An afebrile interval follows the first stage of TBE, and lasting 3 to 21 days (median 7 days 12). During this time, patients are usually free of symptoms. Another sudden rise in temperature marks the beginning of the second stage. Only 20-30% of those infected with the TBE virus proceed into the second phase of the disease. The clinical manifestations of this second febrile episode are far more serious and involve the central nervous system with symptoms of meningitis (e.g., fever, headache, and a stiff neck) or encephalitis (e.g., drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities such as paralysis) or meningoencephalitis.10Hospitalization varies between 3 days and 40 weeks 13;14, depending on the severity of the illness. TBE-infected patients older than approximately 40 years of age increasingly develop the encephalitic form of the disease. In elderly patients, especially those older than 60 years of age, TBE can take a severe course, leading to paralysis and occasionally resulting in death.15;16 Paralysis occurs in 30% of patients who enter the acute phase of the illness.17Not all those infected with TBE run the entire course of the disease. In approximately 65% of cases, the infection remains silent, although viremia can be demonstrated; in some cases, the patient presents the clinical picture of the initial phase of TBE, but the symptoms subside without developing into full-blown TBE.",

Seven \npatients (5.2%) with cerebrospinal fluid changes, compatible with aseptic meningitis, and \nan abnormal electroencephalogram were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). \nOther studies in children (up to 14 years of age) with a history of TBE, which were \npublished between 1962 and 1999, showed 78% meningitis, 21% meningoencephalitis \nand 1% encephalomyelitis cases.20;21;22;23;24;25;26 Rakar reported on sequelae in 6 out of \n160 children (paresis, seizures, emotional disturbance), who were studied in Slovenia \nbetween 1978 and 1992.26 However, the medical details of children with an unfavorable \nprognosis have mostly been presented as individual reports. Roggendorf and colleagues \ndescribed a severe case of meningoencephalitis in a child (12 years old) who experienced \nepileptic seizures after 9 months of hospitalization.27 Failure to recognize abdominal \nsymptoms as criteria of the prodromal stage of TBE has been reported as a reason for \nfatal outcome of the disease resulting in TBE-induced brainstem encephalitis and general \nsinus thrombosis.24 In 1992, Grubbauer and colleagues reported a 3.5 month old baby \nexperiencing severe meningoencephalitis resulting from TBE, which led to an epileptic \nstate and required neurointensive care.28 The first neonatal case of TBE was reported by \nJones and colleagues (2007) 29 in a 17-day old newborn resulting in severe neurologic \nimpairment.\nFSME-IMMUNB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)Protocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 201522In Austria, between 1971 and 1981, a period when TBE vaccination was not performed in children (the first TBE vaccine was formulated for adult use and became available in Austria in 1976), approximately 540 cases of TBE infection in children were observed (personal communication , Institute of Virology, Medical University of Vienna) giving a mean incidence rate of approximately 49 cases per year. In Styria, between 1980 and 1990, four TBE-infected children were admitted to an ICU (however, these children did not suffer from any sequelae).30 Seven children diagnosed with TBE also suffered from different sequelae: epilepsy (n=2), moderate to severe hypacusis (n=2), transient hypacusis (n=2) and one child with mild hypacusis.31These data demonstrate that the course of TBE in children and adolescents can be associated with an unfavorable outcome and permanent neurological damage.

Similar tendencies were observed in Part C.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA dose-finding study (Study 201) to determine the optimal dosage of FSME-IMMUN \n0.5 ml with respect to safety and immunogenicity was conducted in 405 adults aged 16 to \n65 years.32 The subjects were randomized to receive two vaccinations administered at an \ninterval of 21 to 35 days with one of three different antigen amounts: 0.6 \u00b5g, 1.2 \u00b5g or \n2.4 \u00b5g. Subjects received a third vaccination with the same antigen dose administered in \nthis study during the follow-up Study 202. The seroconversion rates determined by \nELISA and/or NT after the second vaccination were 85.8%, 96.9% and 97.0% with the \ndoses 0.6 \u00b5g, 1.2 \u00b5g and 2.4 \u00b5g respectively. The 2.4 \u00b5g dose was determined to be the \noptimal dose, firstly as only the 1.2 \u00b5g and 2.4 \u00b5g doses induced a sufficiently high \nseroconversion rate (according to the predefined criteria), and secondly because the \n2.4 \u00b5g dose was found to be non-inferior to the 1.2 \u00b5g dose with respect to fever rate \nafter the first vaccination. \nThe conclusion of the dose-finding study on FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml was confirmed by \nthe results of a follow-up study (Study 202), in which a third vaccination was \nadministered. The 2.4 \u00b5g dose was found to be the optimal dose of the FSME-IMMUN \n0.5ml vaccine for adults, as it induced a 100% seroconversion rate and a low rate of AEs \nafter the third vaccination.32\nFSME-IMMUN\nB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)\nProtocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015\n25\nStudy 208 was designed as a single-blind, randomized, multicenter safety study \ncompared two TBE vaccines in 3966 healthy subjects aged 16 to 65 years. FSME-\nIMMUN 0.5 ml was found to be non-inferior to Encepur with respect to fever rate after \nthe first vaccination, as the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in \nfever rate after the first vaccination was below the predefined +3% limit. Fever after the \nfirst vaccination was mainly mild in nature and occurred at a very low frequency (0.8%) \nin the FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml study group, compared to the Encepur study group, in \nwhich a rate of 5.6% was determined. Only one moderate fever case was reported and \nthis case occurred following vaccination with Encepur. As observed for the overall fever \nrate after the first vaccination, fever classed as being related to the first vaccination was \nalso considerably lower in the FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml study group (0.6%) than in the \nEncepur group (4.9%). Overall, the study demonstrated that the FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml \nvaccine is safe and induces considerably lower reaction rates than Encepur.33\nAn open-label, multicenter, phase III, follow-up study to Study 208 (Study 213) \ninvestigated the safety of the third vaccination of FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml in subjects aged \n16 to 66 years who had received the first two vaccinations with either FSME-IMMUN \n0.5 ml (n=2790) or Encepur (n=915) during Study 208. Immunogenicity variables were \nassessed pre- and post-vaccination in a subgroup of subjects (n=566 analyzed). \nRegardless of whether FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml or Encepur had been administered for the \ntwo previous vaccinations in Study 208, seroconversion rates as determined by ELISA \nand/or NT after the third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml (compared to baseline) \nwere very high (99.5% and 99.3% respectively). The geometric mean concentrations \n(GMCs, as determined by ELISA) after the third vaccination were higher in the FSME-\nIMMUN 0.5 ml only group (1935.7 VIE U/ml vs. 1508.7 VIE U/ml), while the geometric \nmean titers (GMTs, as determined by NT) after the third vaccination were higher in the \ngroup of subjects who had previously received Encepur (259.0 vs. 371.4). Local and \nsystemic reactions were mainly mild. Fever occurred at a negligible level (0.5%). In \nsummary, these results demonstrate the excellent safety profile of the FSME-IMMUN \n0.5 ml vaccine for the third vaccination in healthy adults. The results further confirm that, \nregardless of which TBE vaccine was administered for the first two vaccinations, a third \nvaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml is well tolerated and induces a strong immune \nresponse when administered 6 months after the first vaccination.33\nFSME-IMMUN\nB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)\nProtocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015\n26\nStudy 223 was an open-label follow-up study to Study 213 to investigate TBE antibody \npersistence at 2 and 3 years after the third TBE vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml, \nas well as TBE antibody response to a booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml \n(administered 3 years after the third vaccination) by means of ELISA and NT (n=328 \nanalyzed). Local and systemic reactions were monitored after administration of the \nbooster vaccination. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As expected, \nimmune response was age dependent, with older subjects (aged 51-67 years) attaining \nGMC and GMT values (determined one month, two and three years after the third \nvaccination in Study 213) which were approximately half of the values for younger \nsubjects(18-50 years of age). The majority of subjects experienced no reaction to the \nbooster vaccination. The rate of occurrence of local and systemic adverse events was low, \nas expected with the administration of a booster vaccination three years after the third \nvaccination.\nThe seropositivity data obtained three years after the third vaccination suggest that it is \nsufficient for the first booster to be administered three years after the completion of the \nprimary vaccination series. This study also demonstrated that FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml is \nextremely well tolerated as a booster vaccination.\nFSME-IMMUN\nB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)\nProtocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015\n27\nStudy 225 investigated the safety and immunogenicity of 2 vaccinations with FSME-\nIMMUN \u201cNEW\u201d 0.5 ml administered using a rapid immunization schedule (Day 0, \nDay 12\u00b12) in healthy adults aged 16 to 65 years (n=60). The main objective of the study \nwas to investigate the antibody kinetics after the second vaccination in order to establish \nthe earliest time point at which vaccinees attained seropositive antibody levels. A total of \n60 subjects received both vaccinations in this clinical study. Blood was drawn from each \nsubject prior to the first vaccination and on Days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 42 after the second \nvaccination. Of the 60 subjects enrolled, 4 were seropositive for TBE virus antibody prior \nto the first vaccination and were excluded from immunological analyses. The \nseropositivity rates as determined by ELISA among the remaining 56 subjects reached \n92.9% by Day 14 and 98.2% by Day 42 after the second vaccination. Seropositivity rates \ndetermined by NT after the second vaccination were higher and increased more rapidly \nthan the corresponding rates determined by ELISA. The proportion of subjects who were \nseropositive as determined by NT on Day 3 was 89.3% and the rate increased to 98.2% \nby Day 14. At Days 21 and 42 after the second vaccination all subjects showed \nseropositive titers as measured by NT.\nSafety constituted a secondary endpoint in the study, and was measured by the \noccurrence of local and systemic reactions after each vaccination. Safety data were \ncollected on all 60 subjects through study completion on Day 42 following the second \nvaccination. No SAEs were reported after either vaccination in the study. Among the \nnon-serious AEs reported in the course the study, the majority were mild, very few \nmoderate and none severe. Local pain and tenderness were the most frequently reported \nqueried local symptoms.\nThe results from Study 225 demonstrate that rapid immunization comprising two \nvaccinations (on Days 0 and 12 \u00b1 2) with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml results in high \nseropositivity rates by Day 14 after the second vaccination. In addition, two vaccinations \nwith FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml given according to a rapid immunization schedule were \nwell tolerated by the subjects participating in this study.\nFSME-IMMUN\nB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)\nProtocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015\n28\nStudy 690501 investigated the immunogenicity and safety of a third vaccination with \nFSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml given approximately 12 months after the second vaccination in \nStudy 225. In Study 225, two vaccinations were given using a rapid immunization \nschedule 12 \uf0b12 days apart. In Study 690501 a total of 44 subjects received two \nvaccinations with FSME-IMMUN \u201cNEW\u201d 0.5 ml, and 41 were included in the \nimmunogenicity dataset. Seropositivity rates for TBE virus antibody were determined by \nELISA and NT separately at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after the third vaccination. \nImmunogenicity results obtained just before the third vaccination was administered \nshowed that titers had decreased to levels very close to or below the seropositivity cut-off \nfor both tests (GMC 113 VIE U/ml; ELISA >126 VIE U/ml is considered positive and \nGMT 13.4; GMT \u226510 is considered positive). Following the third vaccination, a strong \nantibody response was observed, with maximum GMC of 2938.8 VIE U/ml and GMTs of \n360.2 at Day 21 post-vaccination. At Day 3 post-vaccination, 36.6% demonstrated \nseropositivity according to ELISA, while NT only analysis determined a higher \nseropositivity rate of 78.0% of all subjects. All (100%) subjects were determined to be \nseropositive by Day 7 post-vaccination and at all later assessment dates in both tests. The \nmajority of subjects experienced no reaction to the vaccination and no SAEs were \nreported during this study. All local and systemic reactions were mild in nature and \noccurred at a frequency of 34.1% and 13.6% of subjects, respectively. \nThe results from Study 690501 support the need for the third vaccination for achieving \nlonger term protection against TBE, and confirm existing data from previous studies \n(Studies 202 and 213) on the excellent immunogenicity of the third vaccination with \nFSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml. This study also verified previous clinical experience that the \nthird vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml is safe for use in a healthy adult \npopulation.\nStudy 690601 was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of FSME-\nIMMUN 0.5 ml with the first and second vaccination being administered according to the \nrapid immunization schedule (12\u00b12 days apart) and the third vaccination administered \nabout 6 months after the first dose in healthy adults (n=330). The seropositivity rates \nattained in Stratum A (16- 49 years) and Stratum B (\uf0b350 years) after the second \nvaccination as determined by ELISA, significantly increased from Day 7 (7.8% and \n5.7%, respectively) to Day 14 (73.9% and 48.8%, respectively) and reached maximum \nlevels at Day 21 (84.3% and 69.6%, respectively).

The aim of the study \nwas to examine the seroconversion rates of FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml after the second \nvaccination, as well as the tolerability, assessed by body temperature measurements and \nmonitoring of adverse events, after the first and second vaccinations in children. \nHigh seroconversion rates (99%) as determined by ELISA were observed after the second \nvaccination. Most AEs were mild and transient in nature and none were graded as severe. \nFever related to the first vaccination occurred in 29.7%; most cases were mild and none \nwere severe.

The study investigated safety \nand immunogenicity of the third vaccination, administered 9-10 months after the second \nvaccination, as measured by seroconversion rates and adverse event monitoring.\nSerological results of this study showed that the third vaccination with the 1.2 \u00b5g TBE \nantigen is highly immunogenic. After the third vaccination, a seroconversion rate of \n100% was observed (98/98 children).\nSystemic reactions were rare and mild to moderate in intensity.

As calculated from the results of ELISA and/or NT, seroconversion rates \nafter the second vaccination were high (>93%) with all three investigated doses (93.2%, \n98.1% and 100% after vaccination with 0.3 \u00b5g, 0.6 \u00b5g and 1.2 \u00b5g TBE antigen, \nrespectively). These results confirmed the induction of sufficient seroconversion rates \nwith all three doses, therefore all three doses were included in the analysis of the optimal \ndose. The 1.2 \u00b5g dose was shown to be the optimal dose due to predefined safety criteria \n(i.e. to select the highest dose of TBE antigen that is non-inferior (with respect to fever \nafter the first vaccination) to the lowest eligible dose (as determined by immunogenicity).\nOccurrence of fever after the first vaccination was not dose-dependent.

Fever occurrence was age-\ndependent with the highest fever rate occurring in children 1 and 2 years of age (33.3% \nand 19.7%, respectively) and lower rates observed among children aged 5 years (6.3% of \nthe total age group).\nThe 1.2 \u00b5g dose was determined to be safe for children aged 1-6 years and was \ndetermined to be the optimal dose of FSME-IMMUN \u201cNEW\u201d 0.25 ml in children in this \nage group.\nStudy 206 was designed as a follow-up study to Study 199 for subjects (aged 1 \u2013 6 years) \nwho had received the first two vaccinations as part of Study 199 (n=625). In Study 206, \nthe safety and immunogenicity of the third vaccination (administered 6 months \nFSME-IMMUN\nB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)\nProtocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015\n32\n(\u00b1 14 days) after the first vaccination) was examined. Subjects received the same dose \n(0.3 \u00b5g, 0.6 \u00b5g or 1.2 \u00b5g antigen) as for the previous two vaccinations. \nThe seroconversion rate as determined by ELISA and/or NT was highest in the 1.2 \u00b5g \ndose group (100%) with rates of 99.5% and 98.5% observed in the 0.6 \u00b5g and 0.3 \u00b5g \ndose groups, respectively The 1.2 \u00b5g dose was shown to be the optimal dose due to the \npredefined safety criteria. \nFever occurrence after the third vaccination was not dose-dependent. Systemic reactions \nas a whole showed no dose-dependent response. Restlessness and insomnia were the \nmost frequently reported systemic reactions. The occurrence of local reactions after the \nthird vaccination was also comparable between the three study groups.\nStudy 205 was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter dose-finding study that assessed \nthe safety and immunogenicity of the first two doses of FSME-IMMUN \u201cNEW\u201d 0.25 ml \nin 644 subjects aged 6-15 years (until the last day before the 16th birthday). Subjects were \nassigned to one of three study arms (0.3 \u00b5g, 0.6 \u00b5g and 1.2 \u00b5g antigen) at a ratio of 1:1:1 \nusing a blocked randomization system with a block size of > 3. The two vaccinations \nwere administered 21-35 days apart. \nSeroconversion rates calculated from ELISA and /or NT were high (>96%) with both \n0.6 \u00b5g and 1.2 \u00b5g doses of TBE vaccine. The lower rates of the 0.3 \u00b5g dose led to \nexclusion of this dose from the analysis of the optimal dose.\nNo difference in the fever rate was observed between the study groups. Fever after the \nfirst vaccination was predominantly mild and no severe fever cases were reported. No \nclear age-dependency trend was found with respect to fever after either vaccination. No \ndose-dependency was observed with the occurrence of local and systemic reactions after \nthe first vaccination. Fatigue and headache were the most frequently reported systemic \nreactions in this study.\nThe 1.2 \u00b5g dose was determined to be safe for use and, according to both \nimmunogenicity and safety criteria, was found to be the optimal dose of FSME-IMMUN \n0.25 ml in children aged 6-16 years.\nStudy 207 was designed as a follow-up study to Study 205 for subjects \n(aged 6 \u2013 16 years) who had received the first two vaccinations as part of Study 205 \nFSME-IMMUN\nB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)\nProtocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015\n33\n(n= 618). In Study 207, the safety and immunogenicity of the third vaccination \n(administered 6 months (\u00b1 14 days) after the first) was examined. Subjects received the \nsame dose (0.3 \u00b5g, 0.6 \u00b5g or 1.2 \u00b5g antigen) as for the previous two vaccinations. \nAfter the third vaccination, the seroconversion rate as determined by ELISA and/or NT \nwas the highest in the 1.2 \u00b5g dose group (100%), with rates of 99.1% and 95.8% \nobserved in the 0.3 \u00b5g, 0.6 \u00b5g dose groups, respectively. \nFever occurrence after the third vaccination was low and no dose-dependency was \nobserved. Local and systemic reactions were predominantly mild and not dose-dependent \nin frequency. The most commonly reported local reaction was injection site pain. \nHeadache and fatigue were the most frequent systemic reactions, which occurred at a low \nrate and were comparable between study groups.\nThese results demonstrated that the 1.2 \u00b5g TBE-virus antigen dose of FSME-IMMUN \n0.25 ml \u2013 which was found to be the optimal dose according to pre-defined criteria in \nStudy 205 \u2013 is safe and highly immunogenic for the third vaccination in children and \nadolescents aged 6 \u2013 16 years.\nIn Study 209, the safety of five consecutive lots of FSME-IMMUN \u201cNEW\u201d 0.25 ml \n(1.2 \u00b5g TBE antigen) was investigated in healthy children aged 1-15 years, who received \n3 consecutive vaccinations (the first two 21-35 days apart; the third vaccination 6 months \n\u00b114 days after the first). The main objective was the assessment of fever rate after the \nfirst vaccination in three different age groups (1-2 years, 3-6 years, 7-15 years), and to \nassess lot consistency. In addition, immunogenicity was investigated by ELISA and NT \nin a subgroup of subjects. A total of 2419 children were enrolled in Part A of the study, \nwhich comprised the first and second vaccinations. The third vaccination was \nadministered in Part B of the study, in which 2404 subjects who had completed Part A of \nthe study were enrolled.\nA high overall seroconversion rate (96%) was observed 21-35 days after the second \nvaccination as determined by ELISA and/or NT. After the third vaccination, all subjects \nwere shown to have seroconverted compared to baseline. \nAs expected, fever occurred at a substantially lower rate after the second and third \nvaccination than after the first vaccination, and was more frequently observed in younger \nthan in older children after all three vaccinations. The majority of fever cases after all \nFSME-IMMUN\nB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)\nProtocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 2015\n34\nthree vaccinations were mild, and most fever cases subsided within 24 hours. No severe \nfever was observed after the first vaccination.\nLocal reactions occurred less frequently after the second and third vaccinations than after \nthe first. After all three vaccinations, the majority of local reactions were mild and the \nlowest frequency was reported in children aged 1-2 years, with comparable rates of local \nreactions in the 3-6 years and 7-15 years age groups. As expected, the most common \nlocal reactions after vaccination were local pain and tenderness.\nThe majority of systemic reactions (excluding fever) after all three vaccinations were \nmild. Systemic reactions (excluding fever) were reported most frequently in children \naged 1\u20132 years, however, no significant difference was observed between the age groups. \nHeadache was the most frequently reported systemic reaction, followed by restlessness \n(in subjects aged 1-5 years only), fatigue (in subjects aged 6-15 years only), myalgia and \nmalaise (in subjects aged 6-15 years only).\nThese results confirm the consistent safety and high immunogenicity of FSME-IMMUN \n0.25 ml for the vaccination of children and adolescents aged 1-15 years.\nStudy 700401 was designed to investigate the seropersistence of TBE antibodies \napproximately 24, 34, 46 and 58 months after completion of the primary immunization \nschedule (3 vaccinations administered at months 0, 1 and 6 in Study 209) with FSME-\nIMMUN 0.25 ml in children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years. Subjects were offered a \nbooster vaccination at either 36, 48 or 60 months after the third vaccination with either \nFSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml or FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml according to their age, depending on \ntheir individual TBE antibody levels. The antibody response was again assessed \napproximately 1 month after the booster vaccination. The study was completed in \nJuly 2009.\nStudy 700501 aimed to investigate the seropersistence of TBE virus antibodies \napproximately 3 years after a booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior in \nchildren who participated in Study IMAG-146A and were administered three \nvaccinations with either Ticovac 0.25 ml or Ticovac 0.5 ml (without HSA) during this \nstudy. Children were aged 6 months \u2013 3 years at the time of their first vaccination. The \nanalysis of the primary endpoint (seropositivity rate measured by ELISA and/or NT) \nshowed that all (100%) subjects had seropositive levels of TBE virus antibodies \napproximately 3 years after the first booster vaccination. The results of this study confirm \nFSME-IMMUNB9371021 (Formerly Baxter 700802)Protocol Amendment 4, including non-substantial changes upon sponsorship change, 25 JUN 201535the excellent immunogenicity of the primary vaccination series followed by a booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior 3 to 4 years after the third vaccination.Study 700801 was designed as a single-blind, randomized, phase III b multicenter study aiming to investigate the immunogenicity, safety and interchangeability of FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior with Encepur 0.25 ml Children administered according to a conventional schedule (three vaccinations administered at 0, 28 and 360 days). In this study children aged 1 \u2013 11 years will be administered the first and second vaccinations with either FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior or Encepur 0.25 ml Children and the third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior only.

In general, the fever subsides within 24 hours. Fever rates reported after the second vaccination are generally lower as compared to the fever rates after the first vaccination. In very rare cases, febrile convulsions in small children have been reported, in particular after administration of the first dose. However, in the context of this study, a low fever rate is expected after the booster vaccination due to the age of the study subjects. In case of fever antipyretic therapy should be considered.As with any vaccination, allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, cannot be completely ruled out, although their occurrence in connection with vaccination is extremely rare. Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines, including TBE vaccines, are very rare, but can occur. Therefore, appropriate emergency equipment and medication must be at hand whenever an immunization is performed.In the presence of an autoimmune disorder (e.g. multiple sclerosis) or respective genetic disposition, vaccination might have an adverse effect on the course of the disease.As with any other vaccination, central and peripheral nervous system disturbances cannot be completely ruled out.All AEs stated in the package insert for FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml or FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml Junior can also occur after administration of the vaccine.The occurrence of unknown adverse effects cannot be excluded with the administration of any medicinal product.

The study investigates TBE virus antibody persistence at yearly intervals from approximately 3 years (38 months) to 10 years (118 months) after the first booster vaccination (as applicable). The decision whether to administer the second booster vaccination in this study and the timing thereof will depend on the level of serum TBE antibodies detected at the defined assessment time points. Subjects who may not be protected against TBE for an entire further tick season (NT titer \u226420 and / or ELISA value \u2264126 VIE U/ml), should be invited to receive the booster vaccination at either the 40, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, or 120 month time point. Recommendations as to whether or not to administer the booster vaccination will be given by the Sponsor on an individual basis. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be consulted for their opinion in case of inconclusive serological data (e.g. contradictory results in ELISA and NT).The cut-off level for an NT titer of 1:20 as described above was chosen based on the annual decline rate determined in the precursor studies 209 and 700401i, in which antibody persistence was investigated 1, 24 , 34, 46 and 58 months after completion of the TBE primary vaccination series. Annual decline rates were calculated on the basis of log-transformed antibody titers. The mean annual decline rates determined for subjects aged 1-2 years, 3 \u2013 6 years and 7 \u2013 15 years were -0.50, -0.38 and -0.46, respectively. Therefore, an NT titer of 20 at a specified time point would on average be reduced to 12.2, 13.6 or 12.6 within a year for the 3 age categories, respectively, which is just above the cut-off level for seropositivity (NT \u2265 1:10). Also, subjects should receive the booster vaccination in the current study if their ELISA value has declined below the level of seropositivity, i.e. \u2264126 VIE U/ml.38                                                i Study 700401: Open-label Follow-up Study to Investigate the Seropersistence of TBE Antibodies and the Booster Response to a Tick-borne Encephalitis Vaccine in Children and Adolescents aged 3 \u2013 18 Years.
