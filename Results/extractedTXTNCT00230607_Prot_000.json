        "Content": " \u03b1-Galactosidase A (\u03b1GAL) is a lysosomal hydrolase enzyme responsible for the metabolism of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), the enzyme\u2019s major glycosphingolipid substrate. In Fabry disease, an inherited deficiency of \u03b1GAL leads to widespread deposition of GL-3, and to a lesser extent other \u03b1-galactoside-containing glycolipids, in the heart(1), kidney(2), liver(3), skin(4), and intestines.(5) The major clinical signs and symptoms of Fabry disease include skin lesions, benign corneal and lenticular opacities, excruciating acral pain, paresthesias, autonomic dysfunction, cardiac disease, and renal failure.(6)  Progressive glycolipid deposition in the microvasculature lead to failure of target organs resulting in death in the third to fifth decades of life prior to the advent of kidney dialysis and renal transplantation.  Because the X-chromosome carries the \u03b1GAL gene, most affected patients are hemizygous males, although some heterozygous females can also be affected due to lyonization (random inactivation of 1 X-chromosome).(7) Fabrazyme\u00ae has been approved in more than 40 countries, including the European Union, Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States (US).  Genzyme has manufactured a recombinant form of human \u03b1-galactosidase A (r-h\u03b1GAL; agalsidase beta) to provide replacement enzyme to patients with Fabry disease. More detailed information regarding the preclinical and clinical safety, including a complete listing of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), as well as efficacy of Fabrazyme is provided in the Investigator Brochure and/or product labeling.

                "Content": " The r-h\u03b1GAL enzyme (Fabrazyme) is a highly purified form of human \u03b1GAL, made by recombinant DNA technology.  It is well known that immune response may occur following treatment with exogenous human proteins.  In the setting of an endogenous enzyme deficiency, infusion of an exogenous recombinant enzyme to patients\u2019 na\u00efve to the normal enzyme is expected to cause antibody response to the enzyme.  Of the 177 patients evaluated in 7 clinical studies in which a Fabrazyme dose of 1 mg/kg every two weeks (q2w) was used for the duration of the study, the majority developed IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies to Fabrazyme: 84% of 163 males and 43% of 14 females seroconverted. Seroconversion occurred in a mean (SD) time of 194.5 (130.24) days for the 6 females compared to 76.2 (71.16) days for the 124 males.  Of the (electronic    2.0)Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 08  \n23-Mar-2018 \nGZ419828/AGAL02603 - agalsidase beta \nVersion number: 1 \nProperty of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential \nPage 14 \n143 seropositive patients, the majority (a combined total of 66%) exhibit either consistently low \ntiters or declining titers over time.  Continued safe treatment with Fabrazyme has not been \nprecluded by IgG antibody development.  Across the 7 pooled clinical studies of Fabry patients \ntreated with Fabrazyme 1 mg/kg q2w, the most common drug-related AEs were infusion \nassociated reactions (IARs, defined as drug- related events occurring on the day of the infusion).  \nThe most common IARs included chills, pyrexia, nausea, feeling cold, headache, vomiting, \nparaesthesia, blood pressure increased, flushing, feeling hot, chest discomfort, pruritus, body \ntemperature increased, urticaria, fatigue and somnolence.  Most IARs were mild to moderate in \nintensity and non-serious. \nThere is no adequate safety data for the use of Fabrazyme in pregnant or lactating women or the \npossible effects on their infants.  It is not known if Fabrazyme passes through the placenta to the \nembryo or if it is excreted in breast milk.  Maternal IgG antibodies may be passively transferred \ntransplacentally or via breast milk to the fetus/infant.  Whether maternal administration of \nFabrazyme can lead to an IgG and/or IgM (immunoglobulin M) antibody response to Fabrazyme \nby the fetus/infant is not known. \nSome study specific procedures may cause increased risk to the mother or infant, eg, risks \nassociated with phlebotomy include fainting, hematoma, excessive bleeding, or infection. \n \n  \nA small number of patients have experienced anaphylactoid reactions some of which were \nconsidered life-threatening.  Signs or symptoms of possible anaphylactoid reactions have included \nevents of localized angioedema, generalized urticaria, bronchospasm, and hypotension.  The risks \nand benefits of re-administering Fabrazyme following a severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid \nreaction should be carefully considered. \nA complete overview of the safety profile of Fabrazyme can be found in the Investigator\u2019s \nBrochure and/or product labeling. \n(electronic \n \n \n \n2.0)\nAmended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 08  23-Mar-2018 GZ419828/AGAL02603 - agalsidase beta Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 15 ",

There are 3 participation scenarios: mother/infant full participation, mother full participation/infant development only, and mother full participation/infant no participation (see Section 9.1). Whether or not the mother continues to lactate will be assessed at each visit.  Breast milk will be collected at Months 1, 3, and 6 immediately prior to Fabrazyme infusion, just after the end of the infusion, and 2 hours after the end of the infusion.  Breast milk samples will be analyzed for volume, presence of \u03b1GAL activity, total fat content, and total protein concentration. Blood samples from the mother will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis prior to each breast milk collection.  If infant genotyping is performed on the umbilical blood cord sample collected at Baseline visit, a buccal cell sample will be obtained from the mother to rule out contamination of the cord blood sample with maternal DNA. If the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) consent to infant participation, the infant\u2019s growth and development will be assessed.  The infant may also be tested for the formation or continued presence of serum IgG and IgM antibodies to r-h\u03b1GAL and for genotype. For the purposes of this study, the mother and the infant will each be considered a study patient. The mother must be enrolled in the Fabry Registry and will be followed using the Fabry Registry assessment schedule and CRFs as well as this study\u2019s CRF.  During this study, infants will be evaluated, ie, the infant may be tested for IgG and IgM antibodies to r-h\u03b1GAL at birth and Months 2, 6, and 12 and will be tested developmentally at each visit for 24 months, or until the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) withdraws consent and discontinues the infant\u2019s study participation, the infant is discontinued from the study by the Investigator (see Section 7.3.1), or the study is terminated (see Section 7.3.2). If the mother is no longer lactating, the mother will discontinue this study but continue to be followed in the Fabry Registry.  The infant will be followed for development only for the remainder of this 24 month study. ",
