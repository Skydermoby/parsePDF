Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 non-inferiority study in subjects with CIA receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced stage NSCLC.   Approximately 3000 subjects with stage IV NSCLC will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to Groups A and B:  \u2022 Group A: darbepoetin alfa 500 \u00b5g (Q3W) to a hemoglobin ceiling of 12.0 g/dL \u2022 Group B: placebo Q3W Section 6.1.2 describes the dosing algorithms. Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, histology, and screening hemoglobin (local laboratory hemoglobin; sample obtained within 7 days prior to randomization). The study consists of a screening period (up to 21 days), a treatment period, and a long-term follow up (LTFU) period.  Investigational Product (IP) will be given Q3W during the treatment period.  IP will be discontinued within 3 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy, or upon the determination of disease progression, whichever occurs first.  Study visits Q3W and imaging studies Q9W will occur during the treatment period until disease progression.  An end of treatment period (EOTP) visit will occur at the next Q3W visit after disease progression has been determined.  Subjects will then enter LTFU and will be followed with once-every-3-months (Q3M) study visits until death, or until approximately 2700 deaths have occurred (End of Study [EOS]).  Adverse events and serious adverse events will be collected until 30 days after the last dose of IP.  Based on the estimated recruitment rate and the projected survival rate of metastatic NSCLC, the study duration is anticipated to take approximately 7 years for enrollment and 3 years follow up for a total of 10 years from first subject enrolled into study to EOS.   Tumor Sample Banking:  If available and upon the consent of the subjects, archived paraffin embedded tumor tissue blocks or unstained tumor slides (from primary tumor or metastasis) will be collected during screening and submitted upon enrollment for erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) testing, tumor mutation analysis, and other biomarker evaluation.

Investigational product will be supplied in \nvials containing a human serum albumin free polysorbate formulation and darbepoetin alfa \nconcentration of 500 \u00b5g, 300 \u00b5g, 200 \u00b5g or 100 \u00b5g per mL or placebo (without active drug).  Each \nbox will contain a single vial of IP.  Investigational product will be blinded. \nControl Group:  Placebo Q3W \nProcedures \nSee Section 7 and/or Appendix A (Schedule of Assessments) for a complete list of procedures. \nStatistical Considerations \nGeneral Approach \nThe analyses will be based on all randomized and consented subjects who receive at least one \ndose of IP.  Sensitivity analyses will be based on all randomized and consented subjects and on \na prospectively defined per-protocol analysis set.  \nTo preserve the overall significance level for the study, statistical testing of the primary and \nsecondary endpoints will follow a hierarchical structure.  First, the primary endpoint of OS will be \ntested.  If darbepoetin alfa is demonstrated to be non-inferior to placebo with respect to OS then \nPFS will be formally tested.  If darbepoetin alfa is demonstrated to be non-inferior to placebo with \nrespect to PFS then the incidence of RBC transfusions or a hemoglobin \u2264 8.0 g/dL will be formally \ntested.  If non-inferiority is demonstrated for both OS and PFS and superiority is demonstrated for \nthe transfusion endpoint, superiority will then be tested for both OS and PFS using the Hochberg \nprocedure to adjust for multiplicity.  For endpoints that are not designated as primary or \nsecondary, statistical testing will be considered descriptive and no adjustments will be made for \nmultiplicity. \nSample Size Considerations \nA total of 2700 deaths will be observed in order to exclude a hazard ratio (darbepoetin alfa to \nplacebo) of 1.15 with a 1-sided significance level of 0.025.  With 2700 deaths, the study is \npowered at just over 90% if the true hazard ratio is 1.0 (approximately 93%).  To observe 2700 \ndeaths, the study will randomize a total of 3000 subjects which assumes a 7-year enrollment \nperiod, a 3-year follow-up after last subject enrolled, a 1-year survival rate of 51% \n(Sandler et al, 2006), and a common exponential drop-out rate of 0.0511. \nExcluding a hazard ratio of 1.15 corresponds to excluding a decrease in median survival of \napproximately 1.6 months in the darbepoetin alfa arm group compared to placebo.  This \nestimation assumes survival time is exponentially distributed which allows for a conversion from a \nhazard ratio to medians.  A median survival of 12.3 months (Sandler et al, 2006) was assumed as \nthe median survival in the placebo arm in order to derive the difference in medians that \ncorrespond to a hazard ratio of 1.15. \nAnalysis of Primary Endpoint \nThe analysis of OS will use a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by the randomization \nfactors, with treatment group as the only covariate (a sensitivity analysis will include additional \ncovariates potentially predictive of OS to assess the robustness of the primary approach).  \nSubjects last known to be alive will be censored on date of last contact.  Non-inferiority will be \ndeclared if the upper confidence limit for the hazard ratio is less than 1.15 using a 1-sided \nsignificance level of 0.025. \nAnalysis of Secondary Endpoints \nThe same methods used to analyze OS will be used to analyze PFS.  Progression-free survival \nwill be measured from randomization to disease progression (as defined by the version of \nRECIST specified in the protocol at the time of subject enrollment using investigator-assessed \nscans) or death from any cause; subjects without either event will be censored at the last disease \nassessment date.  Non-inferiority will be declared if the upper confidence limit for the hazard ratio \nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa \nProtocol Number:  20070782 \nDate:  13 November 2012 \nPage 7 of 86 \n \nis less than 1.15 using a 1-sided significance level of 0.025.  This analysis will be performed on all \nsubjects in the primary analysis set who have not had disease progression prior to randomization.   \nTo assess treatment group differences in the incidence of RBC transfusions or a hemoglobin \n\u2264 8.0 g/dL, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method will be used which will adjust for the \nstratification factors at randomization.  The incidence will be assessed from day 29 to the EOETP.  \nThis analysis will be performed on all subjects in the primary analysis set whose EOETP is \n\u2265 day 29. \nInterim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines \nAn independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will assess safety on a regular basis \nthroughout the duration of the study.  The DMC will convene approximately once every 6 months \nfor the first 2 years and once a year thereafter during the course of the trial.  In addition, the DMC \nwill oversee 5 formal interim analyses to assess harm (ie, inferiority of darbepoetin alfa), which \nwill occur when approximately 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 60% of the planned total of 2700 \ndeaths have been observed.  If warranted from these reviews, the DMC may request additional \nsafety data, recommend modifying or stopping the treatment, or recommend suspending \nrandomization.  In addition, the DMC will review enrollment status and evaluate changes in the \npractice of medicine to make recommendations regarding the ongoing feasibility of the trial.  Prior \nto the completion of the recruitment period, the sponsor will re-assess the study assumptions (eg, \nrecruitment rate and mortality rate) on a blinded basis, and may revise the sample size in order to \nensure that the study completes. \nSponsor/Licensee: Amgen Inc. \n \nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa Protocol Number:  20070782 Date:  13 November 2012 Page 8 of 86  ",

The etiology of anemia in cancer patients tends to be \nmultifactorial including a direct inhibitory effect by various pro-inflammatory cytokines on \nthe proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursors within the bone marrow \n(Weiss and Goodnough, 2005) coupled with a blunted erythropoietic response to \nendogenous erythropoietin (Cazzola, 2000; Miller et al, 1990).  Additional etiologies of \ncancer related anemia include bone marrow infiltration by tumor, poor nutritional status, \ntumor related hemorrhage and myelotoxicity from systemic chemotherapy and/or \nradiotherapy (Ray-Coquard et al, 1999). \nThe severity of cancer associated anemia depends in part on the extent of the \nunderlying neoplastic disease as well as the regimen of cytotoxic treatments \nadministered.  In a state of persistent anemia, compensatory mechanisms for the \nreversal of tissue hypoxia are instigated including shunting of blood from non-vital areas \nto more essential oxygen-sensitive organs (Vatner, 1974) along with compensatory \ncardiopulmonary hyperactivities resulting in increased cardiac work load \nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa \nProtocol Number:  20070782 \nDate:  13 November 2012 \nPage 18 of 86 \n \n(Metivier et al, 2000; H\u00e9bert et al, 2004).  Symptoms of anemia may include fatigue, \ndyspnea on exertion, shortness of breath, decreased motivation, and impaired cognition \nand depression, with fatigue affecting greater than 65% of patients during their \nchemotherapy treatments.  Fatigue is regarded by patients as a symptom that has a \ngreater negative impact on their daily lives than many other cancer or treatment related \ncomplications (Harper and Littlewood, 2005). \n2.1.2 \nChemotherapy-induced Anemia \nMyelosuppressive chemotherapy is a common cause of anemia in cancer patients with \nthe degree of chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) dependent upon the type, schedule \nand intensity of the chemotherapy regimen.  For patients with non-myeloid malignancy, \nthe highest frequency of anemia occurs among those undergoing systemic therapies for \nlymphoma, lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma or urothelial carcinoma (Ludwig and \nFritz, 1998; Tas et al, 2002; Skillings et al, 1993).  In situations where rapid reversal of \nanemia is required RBC transfusion is indicated, although allogeneic blood product \ntransfusion carries potential undesirable risks including subjecting the recipient to \npossible infection with viral agents such as hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus \n(Barbara, 2004), acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (Sloop and Friedberg 1995), \ntransfusion-related acute lung injury (Looney et al, 2004), allergic reactions (Gilstad, \n2003), iron overload (Franchini and Veneri, 2004) or hypervolemia-related exacerbation \nof congestive heart failure symptoms (Freudenberger and Carson, 2003).  As an \nalternative to blood product transfusion, erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have \nbeen employed as a pharmacological measure to palliate and/or reverse the anemia \nassociated with chemotherapy in non-emergent settings, effectively reducing a patient\u2019s \ntransfusion requirement as well as the number of RBC units required by those who do \nreceive transfusions. \n2.1.3 \nDarbepoetin alfa \nDarbepoetin alfa, a novel glycoengineered analog of rHuEpo with 2 additional extra \nconsensus N-linked carbohydrate addition sites, has a longer mean residence time and \na 3-fold longer serum half-life than rHuEpo in both dialysis and cancer patients as well \nas demonstrating augmented in vivo activity (Egrie et al, 2003; Macdougall et al, 1999; \nElliott et al, 2004; Jung and Schwartz, 2002).  Darbepoetin alfa is manufactured by \nrecombinant DNA technology using a Chinese hamster ovary mammalian cell line and is \ncurrently licensed in the United States, European Union, Australia, and Canada for the \ntreatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure (including patients who are and \nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa \nProtocol Number:  20070782 \nDate:  13 November 2012 \nPage 19 of 86 \n \nare not on dialysis) and for the treatment of anemia in patients with non-myeloid \nmalignancy where anemia is due to the effects of concomitantly administered \nchemotherapy.   \nDetails of the chemistry, preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of \ndarbepoetin alfa are contained in the current version of the Investigator\u2019s Brochure. \n2.2 \nSafety Concerns of ESAs \nIn the CIA setting, an increased risk of thromboembolic events associated with the use \nof ESAs is well documented and reflected in the current ESA label.  However, safety \nconcerns regarding increased mortality or tumor progression with ESAs have also been \nraised by 8 of 59 studies conducted outside of the currently-approved treatment \nindication or recommended target hemoglobin range (Table 1).  Data from randomized, \ncontrolled studies evaluating mortality in subjects treated with ESAs in accordance with \ncurrent labeling are not available.     \n",

Study drug was withheld if hemoglobin level exceeded \n14.0 g/dL.   \nDue to concerns regarding thromboembolic events in other ESA trials, an unplanned \nsafety analysis of this study was conducted after the first 70 subjects (of a planned \n300 subjects) were randomized (33 epoetin alfa group, 37 placebo group).  In this \nanalysis, OS in the subjects receiving epoetin alfa was worse than the subjects who \nreceived placebo (63 versus 129 days, p=0.04), leading to termination of the study.   \nThe majority of deaths in this study, 66 of 70 enrolled subjects, was reported to be due \nto underlying lung cancer; 28 of 32 subjects (87.5%) in the epoetin alfa group and 31 of \n34 subjects (91.2%) in the placebo group died.  Tumor progression was not assessed in \nthis study.  Furthermore, the study was conducted in subjects not receiving \nchemotherapy and who were treated to higher hemoglobin levels than those \nrecommended in the prescribing information.  Consequently no conclusions can be \ndrawn regarding the safety of ESAs in lung cancer patients within the labeled indication \nof CIA when ESAs are used in accordance with current labeling. \n2.2.2 \nCombined Analysis of Safety of ESAs in Lung Cancer \nFive randomized, controlled lung cancer studies in CIA (representing 1943 subjects) \nhave collected long-term follow-up information [Pirker et al, 2007; Grote et al, 2005; \nVansteenkiste et al, 2002; Milroy et al, 2003; and EPO-GER-22 (ODAC 2008)].  An \nadditional two studies [EPO-CAN-15 (ODAC 2008) and Thatcher et al, 1999] reported \ndeaths on study but did not collect long-term follow-up information.  In all studies in CIA, \nESAs had a neutral effect on survival relative to the control group.  These studies, along \nwith study EPO-CAN-20 which did not involve chemotherapy, are summarized in \nTable 3. \n",

Fatigue is regarded by patients as a symptom that has a greater negative impact on their daily lives than many other cancer or treatment related complications (Harper and Littlewood, 2005). ",

                                "Content": " Myelosuppressive chemotherapy is a common cause of anemia in cancer patients with the degree of chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) dependent upon the type, schedule and intensity of the chemotherapy regimen.  For patients with non-myeloid malignancy, the highest frequency of anemia occurs among those undergoing systemic therapies for lymphoma, lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma or urothelial carcinoma (Ludwig and Fritz, 1998; Tas et al, 2002; Skillings et al, 1993).  In situations where rapid reversal of anemia is required RBC transfusion is indicated, although allogeneic blood product transfusion carries potential undesirable risks including subjecting the recipient to possible infection with viral agents such as hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (Barbara, 2004), acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (Sloop and Friedberg 1995), transfusion-related acute lung injury (Looney et al, 2004), allergic reactions (Gilstad, 2003), iron overload (Franchini and Veneri, 2004) or hypervolemia-related exacerbation of congestive heart failure symptoms (Freudenberger and Carson, 2003).  As an alternative to blood product transfusion, erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have been employed as a pharmacological measure to palliate and/or reverse the anemia associated with chemotherapy in non-emergent settings, effectively reducing a patient\u2019s transfusion requirement as well as the number of RBC units required by those who do receive transfusions.

Due to concerns regarding thromboembolic events in other ESA trials, an unplanned safety analysis of this study was conducted after the first 70 subjects (of a planned 300 subjects) were randomized (33 epoetin alfa group, 37 placebo group).  In this analysis, OS in the subjects receiving epoetin alfa was worse than the subjects who received placebo (63 versus 129 days, p=0.04), leading to termination of the study.   The majority of deaths in this study, 66 of 70 enrolled subjects, was reported to be due to underlying lung cancer; 28 of 32 subjects (87.5%) in the epoetin alfa group and 31 of 34 subjects (91.2%) in the placebo group died.

If dose adjustment occurs, all subsequent adjustments will be relative to the new dose.  Rate of rise calculations will be based on the subject\u2019s hemoglobin value at the time of the last dose or for the last 3 weeks of study if more than 3 weeks have passed since the last dose.   If a subject stops myelosuppressive chemotherapy completely, IP will be discontinued within 3 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy.     At any time during the study, the investigator may withhold or discontinue IP administration for any subject who experiences a severe or life-threatening adverse event reported by the investigator to be related to IP.  The Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading scale will be used as a guide for grading the adverse events.  Refer to Section 9 for more detail on adverse event reporting.  If an investigator decides to discontinue IP (regardless of whether the subject will continue in the study), the site personnel are to enter this information into the IVR/IWR System.       IVR/IWR System will instruct investigators to withhold IP or to reduce the dose of IP according to the following criteria, which include non-responsiveness, rapid rate of rise of hemoglobin, and high hemoglobin value.

The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject\u2019s medical record.  These records are the source documents from which data are extracted and reported to Amgen per the reporting procedures (Section 9.1.2). The definition of adverse event includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  Worsening indicates the pre-existing medical condition (eg, cancer, diabetes, migraine headache, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome.  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study, but involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a routine standard of care medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event.  Disease progression (ie, progression of cancer) will not be considered an adverse event, nor a serious adverse event if International Conference for Harmonization (ICH) criteria for seriousness are met.  Disease progression will instead be documented on a specific case report form and analyzed separately as a key secondary study endpoint.

In general, an abnormal laboratory finding without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be considered adverse events.  However, a laboratory value change that requires treatment or adjustment in current therapy would be considered an adverse event.

Darbepoetin alfa will be provided in single dose vials of human serum albumin free (HSA-free) polysorbate solution.  Four vial concentrations will be available:  500 \u00b5g, 300 \u00b5g, 200 \u00b5g, and 100 \u00b5g, each containing a 1.0 ml withdrawable volume of solution (ie, 500, 300, 200 and 100 \u00b5g per ml).  Placebo will be provided in similar single dose vials as a clear, colorless, sterile, protein-free solution containing a 1.0 ml withdrawable volume.  Vials will be packed and shipped in boxes.  Each box of investigational product will have a unique number and will contain one vial.  The box number with the corresponding vial strength and identity of investigational product will be available to IVR/IWR system. The box number of investigational product administered is to be recorded on each subject\u2019s Drug Administration case report form for each dose.  This must be done in such a manner that a subject\u2019s treatment assignment will not be unblinded during the trial. The vials of investigational product must be stored in a secured location and refrigerated at a temperature of 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C and protected from light. Initial shipments of drug and ongoing re-supply will be conducted through the IVR/IWR system.  For more detail refer to the IVR/IWR system manual and study guide. Investigational product details including labeling, storage, preparation, etc are provided in the Pharmacy Guide Appendix E. ",

This PIN is unique to the individual and must not be shared. Since all subjects will be given investigational product, a subject\u2019s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject.

Weight, presence of new / replaced central or mid-line venous catheters, and radiotherapy information will be \ncollected during screening and during the treatment period.  Anti-cancer therapy and anti-cancer surgery information will be collected during the treatment period. \nc. \nAll SAEs that occur after the subject signed the ICF through 30 days post last dose of IP will be collected.  All AEs will be collected after randomization until 30 days post last dose of \nIP.  Signs and symptoms of clinically relevant TVEs will be assessed at each visit during the treatment period.  If present, appropriate labs, diagnostic, and imaging will be performed.  \nAll TVEs, and adverse events associated with RBC transfusions occurring during the treatment period, will be documented in the CRF through the EOTP or until 30 days after the last \ndose of IP, whichever occurs later. \nd. \nIP will be administered SC Q3W during the treatment period.  IP will be discontinued within 3 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy, or upon the determination of disease \nprogression, whichever occurs first.

Iron, ferritin, Tsat%, and TIBC will be \nperformed Q3W. \ni. \nIf available, paraffin embedded tumor block or unstained slides from previous biopsy, along with the matching pathology report will be collected during screening  \nj. \nSerum antibody samples must be collected pre-dose. \nk. \nCentral lab pregnancy testing performed for all female subjects of reproductive potential. \nl. \nSubjects must have had a baseline scan (CT, MRI, or PET-CT) of the chest to assess disease burden before starting on first line chemotherapy for NSCLC and the images must be \nreviewed by the investigator prior to randomization. Images to assess disease status will be obtained Q9W (or sooner if clinically indicated) from Week 1 until disease progression \nusing the same type of scan as at baseline.  Bone scans, MRI, CT, PET, PET/CT, or X-ray will be performed when signs or symptoms suggestive of bone metastasis are present, and \npositive bone scans or PET scans must be confirmed by another imaging method (ie, X-ray, CT or MRI).

Measurements should be recorded unidimensionally.  At baseline, tumor \nlesions/pathologic lymph nodes are categorized as measurable or non-measurable \naccording to the following definitions:  \no\nMeasurable: Measurable lesions are defined at baseline as lesions that can \nbe accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be \nrecorded) \u226510 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 \nmm).  When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum \nsize for a measurable lesion should be the greater of either at least 10 mm or \ntwice the slice thickness.  Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered \npathologically enlarged and measurable a lymph node must be \u226515 mm in \nshort axis when assessed by CT scan.  \no\nNon-measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter \n< 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with \u2265 10 or < 15 mm short axis) and \nother truly non-measurable lesions are considered non-measurable and \ncharacterized as non target lesions.  Other examples of non-measurable \nlesions include some bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, \npleural/pericardial effusion, and lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, \nabdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable \nby reproducible imaging techniques.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm \nare considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. \nClinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, \nskin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and measure \u226510 mm by calipers.  For the \ncase of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to \nestimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  Lesions which cannot be \naccurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable. \nSpecial considerations:\nLytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue \ncomponents that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such \nas CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue \ncomponent meets the definition of measurability described above.  Blastic bone \nlesions are non-measurable. \nCystic lesions:  Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple \ncysts should not be considered as malignant lesions.  Cystic lesions thought to \nrepresent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they \nmeet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if non-cystic \nlesions are present in the same patients these are preferred for selection as \ntarget lesions. \nTumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to \nother loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there \nhas been demonstrated progression in the lesion. \nBaseline (ie, Pre-chemotherapy) Identification of \u201cTarget\u201d and \u201cNon-Target\u201d Lesions\nUp to 5 target lesions (a maximum of 2 per organ) will be chosen to measure over \nthe course of therapy.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size \nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate: 13 November 2012 \nPage 83 of 86\nand their suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imaging techniques or \nclinically. \nA sum of the diameter (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for \nall target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The\nbaseline sum diameters will be used as reference by which to characterize the \nobjective tumor response.\n\ufffd\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions or \npathological lymph nodes that were not chosen as target lesions, should be \nidentified as non-target lesions.  Non-target lesions should be recorded and \nassessed qualitatively over the course of therapy.  These non-measurable, \nnon target lesions should be followed as \u2018present,\u2019 \u2018absent,\u2019 or in rare cases, \n\u2018unequivocal progression.\u2019  \n\ufffd\nBone lesions: Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered \nadequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  If there are signs or \nsymptoms suggestive of bone metastasis, a bone scan, MRI, CT, PET, \nPET/CT, or X-ray will be performed. For subjects with a positive bone scan \nor PET scan, the bone metastasis must be confirmed with another method of \nimaging (ie, X-ray, CT or MRI).  \nResponse Criteria\nThe subject\u2019s tumor response will be assessed based on the response of the target \nlesions, the response of the non-target lesions, and the presence or absence of new \nlesions. \nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate: 13 November 2012 \nPage 84 of 86\nEvaluation of Target Lesions\n* Complete Response (CR):\nDisappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological \nlymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have \nreduction in short axis to < 10 mm. \n* Partial Response (PR):\nAt least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters* \nof the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline \nsum diameters.  \n* Progressive Disease (PD):\nAt least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of \ntarget lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of \nall target lesions recorded since the treatment started.  \nThe sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase \nof at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more \nnew lesions is also considered progression). \n* Stable Disease (SD): \nNeither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor \nsufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference \nthe smallest sum of diameters while on study. \nNot Applicable (NA):\nNo target lesions were identified at baseline. \nInevaluable (NE):\nScans were not performed, were incomplete, or were \ninevaluable due to poor scan quality at this time point \nto evaluate target lesions.\n*Diameters used:\nFor nodal disease: shortest axis\nFor non-nodal disease: sum of longest diameters\nOnce on study, the convention will be used that if a lesion being measured decreases to \nthe point that it is faintly seen and/or too small to measure a value of 5 mm will be \nassigned.  If the lesion subsequently increases in size to greater than or equal to 5 mm \nin one dimension, its true size will be recorded.  Nodal disease should always have the \nactual short axis measurement recorded even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on \nstudy.  When lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the \u2018sum\u2019 of target lesions may \nnot be zero even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having \na short axis of < 10 mm.  For CR, each node must achieve a short axis < 10 mm.  For \nPR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the \nsum of target lesions. \nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate: 13 November 2012 \nPage 85 of 86\nEvaluation of Non-Target Lesions\nComplete Response (CR):\nDisappearance of all non-target lesions.  All lymph \nnodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short \naxis)\nNon-CR/Non-PD: \nPersistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)\nProgressive Disease (PD):\nNot Applicable (NA):\nInevaluable (NE):\nAppearance of one or more new lesions and/or \nunequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions  \nNo non-target lesions identified at baseline\nScans were not performed, were incomplete or were \ninevaluable due to poor scan quality at this time point \nto\nevaluate non-target lesions. \nWhen the patient also has measurable disease, to achieve an unequivocal progression \nthere must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that \neven in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has \nincreased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  When the patient has only non-\nmeasurable disease, the increase of non-measurable disease should be comparable in \nmagnitude to the increase required to declare PD for measurable disease (eg, \nequivalent to a 20% increase in sum of diameters of all measurable lesions). \nEvaluation of Best Overall Response\nThe overall response status is calculated at each time point for subjects as follows: \nTarget lesions\nNon-Target lesions\nNew Lesions\nOverall response\nCR\nCR\nNo\nCR\nCR\nNon-CR/non-PD\nNo\nPR\nCR\nPR\nSD\nNE\nNon-PD or NE\nNon-PD or NE   \nNo\nNo\nNo\nPR\nPR\nSD\nNE\nNon-PD\nNo\nNE\nPD\nAny\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nPD\nYes or No\nPD\nAny\nPR      \nCR\nSD\nNE\nAny\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nPD\nPR\nCR\nSD\nNE\nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa\nProtocol Number:  20070782\nDate: 13 November 2012 \nPage 86 of 86\nTime Point Response in Subjects with Non-target Disease Only\nNon-target Lesions\n(response)\nNew Lesions\n(Yes or No)\nOverall Response\nCR\nNon-CR/non-PD \nNE\nUnequivocal PD\nAny\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes or No\nYes\nCR\nNon-CR/non-PD \nNE\nPD \nPD\nNon-CR/non-PD is preferred over \u2018stable disease\u2019 for non-target disease since SD is  \nincreasingly used as an endpoint of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category \nwhen no lesions can be measured is not advised. \nSpecial Notes on Response Assessment\nSubjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of \ntreatment without objective evidence of disease progression at the time should be\nclassified as \u201csymptomatic deterioriation.\u201d  In this case \u201cprogressive disease\u201d cannot be \nassigned at the time as the overall objective tumor response.  Every effort should be \nmade to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.\nIn some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal \ntissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, the \nresidual lesion may be further investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) at investigator \ndiscretion to confirm the complete response status. \nFor equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic \nchanges or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled \nassessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of \nprogression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected. \nDuration of Overall Response\nThe duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are \nmet for complete response or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until \nthe first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD \nthe smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.\nDuration of Stable Disease\nSD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression \nare met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment \nstarted. \nProduct:  Darbepoetin alfa Protocol Number:  20070782 Date:  13 November 2012 Page 1 of 10  ",

Additionally, in order to address findings from a recent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) inspection, language describing the assessment of expectedness for expedited reporting of safety events was also updated.  Amgen will continue to utilize Core Safety Information in Appendix A of the Investigator\u2019s Brochure (IB) to assess expectedness for applicable expedited reporting of safety events.   A correction was made to the testing frequency for the TIBC iron performed by the central laboratory to remove the Q9W reference.  Additionally, a minor revision was made to move the collection and analyses for C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble transferrin receptor from Screening to Day 1, since these laboratory tests are not used for eligibility.  Other updates to Key Sponsor Contacts, updated sample forms (Appendices C, F, and G), and corrections to typographical errors were also completed.
