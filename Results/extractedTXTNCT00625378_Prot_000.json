The patients should be evaluated \nby a study physician for safety at least once every 8 weeks and more frequently as needed. The \nprotocol allows for a \u00b17 days window when scheduling any visit. Physicians can choose to \ncontinue to see the patients every 8 weeks in a face to face visit. At least every other visit must be\na mandatory on site visit for examination and drug dispensing, with the other visit being either in \nperson or as a phone call. It is at the discretion of the investigator based on the patient\u2019s current \ncondition and adverse event profile to determine if the next visit will be performed on site or as a\nphone visit. Any scheduled phone visit is mandatory and it will be at the discretion of the \ninvestigator to decide if that phone visit is sufficient. If the patient needs a physical examination, \nthe visit will be performed on site. If the investigator feels the patient is stable with no new safety \nconcerns nor new AEs in between visits, a phone call with labs, ECOG and review of AEs would \nbe enoughcc. Once every 8 weekscc safety evaluations include vital signs (ie, heart rate, blood \npressure, temperature) only when the visit is on site, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \n(ECOG) performance status, laboratory evaluations may be performed by local accredited lab\nwhich need to have PI signoff within a week of drawingdd (hematology, ALT, AST, lipase and \namylase, PT-INR as applicable for anticoagulated patients) and a review of any new or ongoing \nadverse event or concomitant medications as well as study medication taken during the visit \ninterval.

Study drug may be continued during \npalliative radiotherapy.\nSince there is a possibility of decreased sorafenib (Nexavar) efficacy upon chronic co-\nadministration of CYP3A4 inducers with sorafenib (Nexavar), chronic co-administration of\nCYP3A4 inducers with sorafenib (Nexavar) should be avoided to the extent possible.\n",

No \nclinical trials have formally evaluated treatments for rash induced by erlotinib, and there are \ncurrently no evidence-based recommendations for its management. \nIntegrated Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 8\nBAY 43-9006 / 12311\n26 MAY 2020\nVersion 7.0\nPage: 66 of 147\nSubjects who develop a mild rash characterized by pustules or raised, red areas may be treated \nwith topical therapy, such as corticosteroids.  If the rash is more severe or there is indication of \nsecondary infection, topical clindamycin or tetracycline, or oral minocycline may be used at the \ndiscretion of the investigator.  (NOTE:  minocycline is known to interfere with anticoagulants and \noral contraceptives.  Therefore, subjects treated with minocycline who are taking anticoagulants \nand/or oral contraceptives should be monitored accordingly).  Guidance concerning modification \nof study drug dosing is provided in Table 4-8.\nBecause the pathology of such a rash is not related to acne pathology, retinoids and other acne \nmedications, such as benzoyl peroxide, are not recommended, because these agents are more \nlikely to exacerbate the rash due to their drying effects on the skin.  \nAnti-diarrhea medications may be introduced if symptoms occur.  Previous trials have shown that \nthe frequency and severity of diarrhea rarely hindered the administration of erlotinib and that the \ndiarrhea could be managed with loperamide.  The recommended dose of loperamide is 4 mg at \nfirst onset, followed by 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours until the subject is diarrhea-free for 12 hours.\nIntegrated Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 8\nBAY 43-9006 / 12311\n26 MAY 2020\nVersion 7.0\nPage: 67 of 147\nTable 4-9:  Dose Modification Plan for Hypertension\nGrade\nDose \nInterruption\nDose Reduction\nAntihypertensive \nTherapy\nBlood Pressure \nMonitoring\nHypertensive NCI \nCTCAE V3\nSorafenib\nErlotinib\nGr 1\nTreat on time\nInitiate \nsupportive \ncare\nNo change in \ndose \nNo change in dose \nNone\nRoutine\nAsymptomatic, \ntransient, (<24hrs) \nincrease by >20 \nmmHg (diastolic) or \nto >150/100 if \npreviously WNL; \nintervention not \nindicated.\nGr 2\nTreat on time\nInitiate \nsupportive\ncare\nNo change in \ndose \nNo change in dose \n(asymptomatic)\nInitiate monotherapy \n(suggest \ndihydropyridine \ncalcium-channel \nblocker).\n(asymptomatic)\nIncrease frequency \nand monitor (by health \nprofessional) every 2 \ndays until stabilized.\nRecurrent or \npersistent (>24 hrs) \nor symptomatic \nincrease by \n>20 mmHg \n(diastolic) or to > \n150/100 if previously \nWNL; monotherapy \nmay be indicated.\n(symptomatic \n/persistent)\nOR\nDiastolic BP > 110 \nmmHg\nAdd agent(s):\n\uf0b7Ca++ channel blocker \n(if not already used)\n\uf0b7K+ channel opener \n(angiotensin \nblockers), \n\uf0b7Beta-blocker\nThiazide diuretic\n(symptomatic/ \npersistent)\nOR\nDiastolic BP > 110 \nmmHg\nIncrease frequency \nand monitor (by health \nprofessional) every 2 \ndays until stabilized.\nIntegrated Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 8\nBAY 43-9006 / 12311\n26 MAY 2020\nVersion 7.0\nPage: 68 of 147\nTable 4-9:  Dose Modification Plan for Hypertension\nGrade\nDose \nInterruption\nDose Reduction\nAntihypertensive \nTherapy\nBlood Pressure \nMonitoring\nHypertensive NCI \nCTCAE V3\nSorafenib\nErlotinib\nGr 3\n\uf0b7Hold both \nagents until \n\u2264\uf020Gr 2\n\uf0b7Initiate \nsupportive \ncare\nRe-evaluate \nweekly\n1st episode:  \nreduce \nsorafenib to \nlevel \u20131 (400 mg \nonce daily) upon \ncontinuation of \ntreatment.\n1st episode:  no \nchange in dose \nupon continuation \nof treatment.\nAdd agent(s):\n\uf0b7Ca++ channel blocker \n(if not already used) \n\uf0b7K+ channel opener \n(angiotensin blockers) \n\uf0b7Beta-blocker \nThiazide diuretic\nIncrease frequency \nand monitor (by health \nprofessional) every 2 \ndays until stabilized.\nRequiring more than \none drug or more \nintensive therapy\nthan previously.\n2nd episode:  no \nchange in dose \nupon \ncontinuation of \ntreatment.\n2nd episode: \nreduce erlotinib \nto level \u20131 (100 \nmg once a day) \nupon continuation \nof treatment.\n3rd episode: \nreduce \nsorafenib to \nlevel \u20132 (400 mg \nevery other day) \nupon\ncontinuation of \ntreatment. \n3rd episode:  no \nchange in dose \nupon continuation \nof treatment.\n4th episode:  no \nchange in dose \nupon \ncontinuation of \ntreatment.\n4th episode:  \nreduce erlotinib\nto level \u20132 (50 mg \nonce a day) upon \ncontinuation of \ntreatment.\nGr 4\nREMOVE \nFROM STUDY\nLife-threatening \nconsequences (e.g., \nhypertensive crisis)\nIntegrated Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 8\nBAY 43-9006 / 12311\n26 MAY 2020\nVersion 7.0\nPage: 69 of 147\n4.5.2.2.2  Dose Modification for Hand-Foot Skin Reaction\nSubjects experiencing Hand-Foot Skin Reaction should have their signs and symptoms \ngraded according to the following system (see Table 4-10).

Only sorafenib will be provided by the \nsponsor.\nThe protocol sections affected by this change are Section 4.1 Study design and Plan, Section \n4.5.1 and Treatments to be Administered and Section 4.5.3.3 Capecitabine.\nModification 4 Removal of references to placebo in association with sorafenib \nadministration in Study 12444 (RESILIENCE).\nIn Study 12444 (RESILIENCE), subjects received either capecitabine and sorafenib or \ncapecitabine and placebo.  In this protocol, the text as written can be misinterpreted to \nindicate that subjects from Study 12444  received both sorafenib and placebo and none of the\nsubjects received sorafenib and placebo in Study 12444.  This modification removes the word \nplacebo when referring to subjects in Study 12444 who received sorafenib.\nThe protocol sections affected by this change are Section 4.5.2.2 Sorafenib and capecitabine \ncombination, Section 4.5.2.2.2 Dose modification for hematologic toxicities, \nSection 4.5.2.2.3 Dose modification for non-hematologic toxicities, Section 4.5.2.2.4 Dose \nmodification and management of sorafenib-specific toxicities and Section 4.5.2.2.6 Dose \nmodification for other non-hematologic toxicities (excluding fatigue, dermatologic toxicities, \ngastrointestinal toxicities, hypertension and toxicities attributable to capecitabine).\nModification 5 Addition of TACE to the permissible anticancer chemotherapies in \nSection 4.5.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy and addition of guidance on Sorafenib \ndose modification in combination with TACE in Section 4.5.2.3.\nOne of the changes implemented during Amendment 2 (16 Mar 2011) was to modify the \nexclusion criteria to allow patients who were receiving TACE and sorafenib in a Bayer \nIntegrated Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 8\nBAY 43-9006 / 12311\n26 MAY 2020\nVersion 7.0\nPage: 104 of 147\nsponsored study to participate in the STEP study. This is reflected in protocol Section 4.2.2\n(Exclusion criteria) and in Section 10.2.2 that describes the changes and rationale for the \namendment. However, Section 4.5.8(Prior and Concomitant Therapy) was not modified to \nallow the concomitant use of TACE and sorafenib and is not in line with the intent of \nAmendment 2 and the related text in Section 4.2.2. \nThe lack of changing Section 4.5.8to be in line with the other sections of the protocol was an \nunintentional oversight. The study team issued an administrative letter on 11 Dec 2013 to \nclarify that since the implementation of Amendment 2, concomitant TACE and sorafenib is \npermissible as per the protocol (Section 4.2.2 and 10.2.2). This discrepancy in Section 4.5.8\nis now being corrected in this amendment to reflect that TACE is permissible.\nMeanwhile, the guidance on Sorafenib dose modification in combination with TACE is added \nas the Section 4.5.2.3.\nThe protocol section affected by this change are Section 4.5.2.3 Sorafenib and TACE \ncombination and Section 4.5.8 Prior and Concomitant Therapy (Non-permissible concomitant \nmedication/therapies).\nModification 6 Clarification of which CTC version was used for the grading of liver \nfunction abnormalities.\nSince there are differences between CTC versions in the definitions of severity grades for\nliver function test abnormalities, it was decided to specify the version of CTC used as a \nreference for the grading.\nThe protocol section affected by this change is Section 4.5.2.3 Sorafenib, Table 4-13 and \nTable 4-14.\n",
