        "Title": "OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO PLANNED ANALYSES FOR THE FINAL CSR",
        "Content": "OVERVIEWVersion 5.0 of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) incorporates updates resulting from Protocol Amendments 5 (A5) through the current Amendment 10 (A10) (including a 2017 Protocol Administrative Change Letter).  Text taken directly from the protocol appears in italics.  Major updates include a shortened duration for Segment 1 for the on-demand (OD) cohort to 6 months duration from 12 months (Amendment 7 [A7]), removal of incremental recovery assessment at visit 7 and consequently the analysis of k-value (incremental) recovery over time (A7), and an increase in the upper age for the inclusion criteria from less than 6 years to less than 16 years (A10).  The original planned sample sizes and the sample size re-estimation results appear in A10 and are reflected in italics.  A summary of changes to planned analyses for the Final clinical study report (CSR) is described in the Summary of Changes Section which immediately follows below. These changes do not appear in the body of the SAP 5.0, as they were determined after the implementation of Protocol Amendment 10. These changes include those that were implemented for either of the 2 Interim CSRs (dated 07 November 2013 and 11 April 2016),which will also be applicable for the final study report. In addition, clarification is provided regarding additional changes to analyses planned for the final study report, as a result of recent communications with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), dated 28 January 2016 and 27 January 2017.  Two additional appendices have been added to support this SAP:Appendix B provides a summary of changes in the conduct of the study, as per the ten protocol amendments and is included for background information.  Appendix C provides for reference the Summary of Changes to Planned Analyses implemented for both Interim clinical study reports (from CSR Section 9.8.2 in each report). Some of these changes are also relevant to the Final CSR and are referred to in the Summary of Changes Section which immediately follows below.SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO PLANNED ANALYSES FOR THE FINAL CSR1. The first interim CSR presented safety, efficacy and baseline data for subjects at Site separately from data for subjects at other sites, due to serious breaches of GCP compliance by the investigator and study staff at Site  pertaining to data integrity. As implemented in the second Interim CSR, in the Final CSR, safety, efficacy and baseline summary data will be presented excluding Site  with the exception of protocol deviations, recovery/pharmacokinetic data, and inhibitor incidence, which include all sites.PPDPPDPPDMoroctocog alfa (AF-CC)\nProtocol 3082B2-313-WW/B1831001\n6\nPfizer\n2. As determined for the second Interim CSR for the study\u2019s primary endpoint analysis in \nthe OD cohort only, a linear mixed-effects model with unstructured variance-covariance \nmatrix provides a more robust model for the comparison of annualized bleeding rate \n(ABR) given the nature of the study data, while still controlling for the same factors as \nspecified in the SAP ANOVA model. This model allows for the inclusion of all intent-\nto-treat (ITT) subjects with ABR data and also takes into account the correlation between \nthe 2 within-subject measurements of ABR at each segment. Because all enrolled \nsubjects had severe (<1%) hemophilia at baseline (ie, just one level of the factor was \npresent and therefore not informative), hemophilia severity is not included as a factor in \nthe model as planned. In the Final CSR, the estimates of the ABR for each regimen\n(segment) and for the difference as well as the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence \nintervals (CIs) will be reported using the linear mixed-effects model described above\nrather than as described in SAP Section 3.3.1.2.\n3. As implemented in the second Interim CSR as per FDA Written Response dated \n28 January 2016 (CRMTS #10042, BL 125264/1540), supportive analyses will also be \nperformed for the ITT population for the Final CSR. A paired t-test will be used to test \nthe within-subject change in ABR for the subjects who will be evaluated with both OD\nand routine prophylaxis (RP) dosing during the study. In addition, a one-sided 95% CI \nfor the ratio of the arithmetic means for ABR during RP over the ABR during OD \ntreatment will be calculated. Ogawa's parametric confidence interval for the ratio of two \npaired means1 assumes the ABR is bivariate normally distributed for RP and OD \ntreatments and will be calculated using R statistical software (version 3.2.3). If the one-\nsided 95% upper confidence bound is \u22640.5, then this will confirm that the ABR during \nRP treatment was at least 50% lower than that observed during OD treatment.\n4. In accordance with FDA correspondence dated 27 January 2017 (IND 10040/246) stating \nthat a non-inferiority clinical margin M2 of 3 bleeds or fewer per year may be adequate, \nequivalence between the 2 RP regimens will be declared if the limits of the 90% two-\nsided confidence interval fall wholly within the interval of (\u22123, 3) bleeds per year, rather \nthan protocol/SAP specified (\u22124, 4) (SAP Sections 1.4.2 and 3.3.2.2).\n5. Per FDA correspondence dated 27 January 2017 (IND 10040/246), incidence rate of \ninhibitor development will be additionally described by number of prior exposure days at \nstudy entry.  For this assessment, based on the risk of the inhibitor development \naccording to the number of exposure days, minimally treated patients (MTPs) will \ninclude those who had accrued 20 to <50 exposure days to any FVIII replacement \nproduct prior to enrollment into Protocol B1831001.  Note: Previously treated patients \n(PTPs) are patients who have received FVIII replacement therapy.  Prior to Protocol \nAmendment 4, PTPs were defined for the purposes of the study as those who had accrued \nat least 50 exposure days (EDs) to any FVIII replacement product prior to study \nenrollment.  To improve enrollment, in Protocol Amendment 4 (dated 15 September \n2009) this number was decreased to at least 20 prior EDs for inclusion in the study. SAP\nSection 3.4.2.1 refers to Inhibitor Development.\nMoroctocog alfa (AF-CC)\nProtocol 3082B2-313-WW/B1831001\n7\nPfizer\n6. For the exploratory analysis in RP cohort subjects, to test for the presence of treatment \nsequence, period and carryover effects, SAP Section 3.3.2.2 states that the ANOVA \nmodel will be fitted with terms for treatment sequence (AB or BA), treatment frequency \n(A or B), period (study segment 1 or 2), carryover and subject nested in treatment \nsequence.  However, this model is overparameterized.  Instead, the more appropriate \nmixed-effect model ABR=sequence period treatment, with subject as a random effect will \nbe used to evaluate the treatment effect.  Contrasts will be constructed to test if the \ncarryover effect for each sequence is the same, and if the same, if that carryover effect is \nequal to zero. \n7. Protocol Amendment 10 has text in section 15.2 (also appears in SAP Section 2.2) which \nstates that the pharmacokinetic dose will be prepared from a single lot.  However, \nmultiple lots were used over the course of this study. \n8. Protocol Amendment 10 has text in sections 22 and 22.6 (also appears in SAP Section 3) \nwhich indicates that both efficacy and safety will be reported separately for the 2 cohorts \n(OD and RP).  However, only efficacy data is presented separately, and safety data is \npresented for all subjects combined.\nMoroctocog alfa (AF-CC)Protocol 3082B2-313-WW/B18310018Pfizer",

                "Content": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disease in which clotting factor VIII (FVIII) is deficient or inactive.  Patients with a low level of FVIII have an increased tendency to bleed.  When the levels of FVIII are very low (\uf0a32% of normal), spontaneous bleeding episodes may occur.  Infusing patients with a concentrated formulation of the missing FVIII protein can control the bleeding. ReFacto (moroctocog alfa) is a commercially available B-Domain Deleted Recombinant FVIII.  A modified manufacturing process has been developed to produce ReFacto with an albumin free cell culture (AF-CC) that eliminates the use of all human or animal-derived proteins and therefore enhances the overall viral safety for patients.  This product is referred to as moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) and this nomenclature will be used through this statistical analysis plan.While prophylaxis therapy with FVIII products has increasingly been prescribed worldwide, direct clinical information on optimal prophylaxis dosing strategies is limited.  Therefore, this study will directly evaluate the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis to reduce bleed rates relative to moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) on-demand therapy, and will compare the clinical outcomes of a high- versus a low-frequency dosing regimen in a randomized crossover design.  In addition, younger hemophilia A patients may respond differently to FVIII therapy compared with older children and adults.  Therefore, this study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in children younger than 16 years of age.",

Subjects who practice prophylaxis will be randomized to one of two regimens.  The two prophylaxis treatment regimens, each delivering approximately 90 IU/kg/week, but differing in dosing schedule, will be:A: 45 \u00b15 IU/kg, administered twice a weekB: 25 \u00b15 IU/kg, administered every other dayFor segment 2, all subjects will use moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) for a 12-month period of prophylaxis treatment.  Subjects who practiced on-demand therapy during segment 1 will practice prophylactic regimen B, defined above.  Subjects who practiced prophylaxis during segment 1 will crossover to the other prophylactic treatment.  A subset of subjects will participate in assessments for moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) PK characterization.  This subset of subjects will undergo a baseline PK assessment, receiving a single open-label dose of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) (50 \u00b15 IU/kg) with blood sampled for FVIII activity measurements before and at 0.5, 8, 24, 28 (optional), and 32 hours after the infusion.  Subjects on on-demand therapy for segment 1: Subjects who practice on-demand therapy at the time of the screening visit may continue to practice on-demand therapy with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in segment 1 (6-month period).  These subjects will then practice prophylaxis regimen B for their 12-month period (segment 2) of treatment.Subjects on prophylaxis treatment for segment 1: Subjects who are not assigned to the on-demand cohort in segment 1 will practice prophylaxis with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) for both segments of the study and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA) for a crossover evaluation of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC).  Thus, subjects who practiced prophylaxis regimen A during segment 1 will crossover to prophylactic regimen B in segment 2 and vice versa.  Randomization of these subjects will also be stratified by hemophilia A severity: FVIII activity <1% or 1-2% (central laboratory screening result).During prophylaxis (segment 1 and/or segment 2), a subject\u2019s treatment will be escalated to a higher intensity comprised of the most intensive components of both regimens A and B (45 \u00b15 IU/kg, administered every other day) if criteria justifying regimen escalation are met.  During prophylaxis, subjects will also use moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), as needed, for the treatment of bleeds (ie, on-demand), should they occur.Clinical and laboratory examinations, including assessments for FVIII inhibitor development, will be conducted during the course of the study.",

Subjects undergoing PK assessments could be from either cohort.  See SAPSection 1.3.3.At the beginning of segment 1, a subset of eligible subjects will participate in the PK assessment.  Also at the beginning of segment 1, the investigator can choose to assign subjects to the OD subject group if the subject was previously practicing on-demand therapy, otherwise subjects will enter the RP subject group.

Twenty-four (24) subjects (the OD subject group) will contribute to the comparison of ABR in the on-demand versus prophylaxis treatment settings; 48 subjects (the RP subject group) will contribute to the comparison of ABR in the 2 prophylaxis regimens (A and B).  From the total of 72 subjects, a subset of approximately 23 PK subjects (meeting specific criteria) is needed for PK assessments for the objective of PK characterization.

In a previous Wyeth moroctocog alfa pediatric study, protocol 3082A1-301-WW (study 301), a reduction in the ABR was observed for subjects during their periods of prophylaxis (\u22652 infusions per week) compared to their periods of on-demand treatment (reduction of 5.7 \u00b16.9 bleeds per year, [11.85 to 6.15 bleeds per year], ABR decrease of 48%, N=39).  Based upon this experience, a more conservative decrease in ABR of 40% (corresponding to a mean change of 4.75 bleeds per year) and a standard deviation of 7 were selected for use in power calculations for the comparison of ABRs in the on-demand versus prophylaxis setting for this study.  A 40% treatment effect difference is considered to constitute a clinically significant reduction in ABR for sample size estimation.  Using a paired t-test and the above assumptions, it was determined that a sample size of 18 OD subjects will provide 80% power to detect such a difference using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  Based upon prior recombinant FVIII clinical studies, an attrition rate of up to approximately 25% may be expected.  Therefore, approximately 24 OD subjects are required to ensure that 18 are evaluable for the comparison of ABRs in the on-demand versus prophylaxis setting.",

Data from the previously mentioned moroctocog alfa study 301 revealed an ABR of 5.7 \u00b15.2 (N=26) in subjects receiving a high-frequency prophylaxis regimen (3 infusions per week) compared to an ABR of 7.1 \u00b14.1 (N=13) in patients receiving a lower-frequency prophylaxis regimen (2 infusions per week).  Assuming an intraclass correlation of 30% and a standard deviation of 6 bleeds per year based on the above study results, a within-subject standard deviation of 5 bleeds per year was used for sample size calculations for the comparison between the high- and low-frequency prophylaxis regimens.  Given this, 36 RP subjects are needed to provide 80% power to demonstrate equivalence of the two regimens.  The two regimens will be considered equivalent if the limits of the 90% two-sided confidence interval for the difference in observed mean ABRs falls wholly within the interval of \u20134 to 4 bleeds per year.  Allowing for an attrition rate of 25%, approximately 48 RP subjects should be enrolled to support this objective.Based on a sample size re-estimation using data from this ongoing study, a difference of means of 1.3 bleeds per year between the two protocol-defined prophylaxis regimens (A and B) with a corresponding standard deviation of the difference of 6.5 was obtained requiring 38 subjects to provide 80% power to demonstrate equivalence of the two regimens. Allowing for an attrition rate of 30%, approximately 56 RP subjects need to be enrolled. The two prophylaxis regimens will be considered equivalent if the limits of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval for the difference in observed mean ABRs fall wholly within the interval defined by fewer than 4 bleeds per year.

        "Content": "Changes in the Planned Analyses were described in Section 9.8.2 within each of the 2 interim CSRs for this study.Interim CSR 1 (dated 07 November 2013), in support of the Pediatric 2013 sBLA9.8.2 Changes in the Planned Analyses: The analyses reported in here are limited and restricted to descriptive statistics.  Safety, efficacy and baseline data for subjects at Site are presented separately from data for subjects at other sites, due to serious breaches of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliance by the investigator and study staff at Site  pertaining to data integrity. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are objective and it is believed that interpretation of these data is not compromised by the deficiencies noted at Site  The PK data which were collected from subjects from this site are, therefore, presented and included in the summary for the study.Interim CSR 2 (dated 11 April 2016), in support of the Prophylaxis 2016 sBLA9.8.2 Changes in the Planned Analyses: The previous interim CSR presented safety, efficacy and baseline data for subjects at Site  separately from data for subjects at other sites, due to serious breaches of GCP compliance by the investigator and study staff at Site  pertaining to data integrity. In this second interim CSR, safety, efficacy and baseline summary data are presented excluding Site  with the exception of protocol deviations, and inhibitor incidence, which include all sites.As per the SAP Section 3.3, efficacy data on and subsequent to the date of inhibitor development was not to be included in the efficacy analyses. However, with the exception of the following summary tables: CSR Section 14.2, Table 14.2.4.3, Table 14.2.4.4, Table 14.2.5.1, and Table 14.2.5.2, the efficacy summary tables did not exclude bleeds occurring after inhibitor development. (This has been corrected for the Final CSR).During the programming for the primary endpoint, prior to the data snapshot and prior to analysis, it was determined that a linear mixed-effects model with unstructured variance-covariance matrix would provide a more robust model for the comparison of annualized bleeding rate (ABR) given the nature of the study data, while still controlling for the same factors as specified in the SAP ANOVA model. This model allows for the inclusion of all intent-to-treat (ITT) subjects with ABR data including the 1 subject with Segment 1 (on-demand [OD] regimen) only at the time of the data cut-off for this second interim analysis and also takes into account the correlation between the 2 within subject measurements of ABR at each segment. Because all enrolled subjects had severe (<1%) hemophilia at baseline (ie, just one level of the factor was present and therefore not informative), hemophilia severity was not included as a factor as planned. The estimates of the ABR for each regimen (segment) and for the difference as well as the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported using the linear mixed-effects model.Supportive analyses were also performed for the ITT population. A paired t-test was used to test the within-subject change in ABR for the 8 subjects who were evaluated with both OD and routine prophylaxis (RP) dosing during the study.
