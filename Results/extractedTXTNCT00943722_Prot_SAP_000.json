This vaccine offers the potential of significant \nprophylactic cancer coverage in addition to that already provided by GARDASIL\u2122, with \nan increase in overall cervical cancer coverage from approximately 70% to 90%. This is \nin addition to the potential of coverage for genital warts provided by VLPs of HPV Types \n6 and 11.\nProtocol V503-002 was a 12-month study to evaluate the immunogenicity and tolerability \nof 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine in preadolescent and adolescent girls and boys, 9 to 15 \nyears of age with a comparison to young women, 16 to 26 years of age. All enrolled \nsubjects received a 3-dose regimen of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine (at Day 1, Month 2, \nand Month 6), were evaluated for immunogenicity at Month 7 (28 days post-dose 3) and \nfollowed for safety from Day 1 through Month 12. The safety and immunogenicity data \nfrom the study will be used to bridge V503 efficacy findings for the 9 vaccine HPV types \nin young women, 16 to 26 years of age, to preadolescents and adolescents.\nProtocol V503-002-10 was a study extension to continue to evaluate safety and assess \npersistence of antibody responses to 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine for an additional 2 \nyears in preadolescent and adolescent subjects initially enrolled in Protocol V503-002. \n                                                \n1The 9-valent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine will \nhereafter be referred to as 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine in this protocol\n2 GARDASIL [Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Recombinant Vaccine] is a \nregistered trademark of Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, U.S.A.

Antibody persistence and long term vaccine effectiveness \nin that demographic group is to be assessed in a different study (Protocol V503-001).\nProtocol V503-002-20 is a second study extension to evaluate longer-term \nimmunogenicity and safety of V503 in subjects who were enrolled in Protocol V503-002 \nwhen they were between 9 and 15 years of age.  In addition, data permitting, the \nextension will evaluate the effectiveness of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine in preventing \npersistent infection, cervical, vulvar, vaginal, perineal, perianal, and penile intraepithelial \npreinvasive and invasive disease, and external genital lesions caused by HPV types \ntargeted by 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine.\n1.4\nSUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN\nThe proposed study will extend the study up to Month 126 for preadolescent and \nadolescent girls and boys between the ages of 9 to 15 years at randomization. All subjects \nwho were enrolled in Protocol V503-002, received 3 doses of the 9-valent HPV L1 VLP \nvaccine and consent/assent to participate in Protocol V503-002-20 will be eligible.  All \nsubjects will be followed up for 10 years post-dose 3.  No subject will receive study \nvaccinations during the proposed long term follow-up study.\nThe purpose of this study extension is to collect data on long term immunogenicity, \nsafety, and effectiveness of the vaccine. Until subjects reach 16 years of age, serum \nsamples and safety information will be collected annually.

Under the base \nstudy (Protocol V503-002), subjects were administered a 3-dose regimen of 9-valent \nHPV L1 VLP vaccine and assessed for immunogenicity (at Day 1 and Month 7) and \nsafety (Day 1 through Month 12). Under Study Extension V503-002-10, subjects \ncontinued to be followed for immunogenicity and safety through Month 36. Subjects will \ncomplete the Month 36 visit (which is the last visit in Protocol V503-002-10) before \nstarting in Protocol V503-002-20.  The long term follow-up period under Protocol V503-\n002-20 will start at the Month 42 visit and end at the Month 126 visit (approximately 7.5 \nyears later and approximately 10 years post-dose 3).  \nVisit schedule and study endpoints will vary depending on age and gender. \n\uf02d\nPrior to reaching 16 years of age, subjects will have an annual visit.

Longitudinal plots of anti-HPV levels will be \nprovided for each HPV type.  The primary analysis will be per-protocol.\nIn addition, exploratory analyses regarding the kinetics and persistence of the antibody\nresponse may be conducted, with particular interest in the effect of age at first \nvaccination on duration of anti-HPV levels.  Modeling techniques may be used to study \nthe relationship between anti-HPV persistence and factors such as time since vaccination, \nage at vaccination, age at sexual debut, and GMT at 1 month post-dose 3.\n2.7.2\nEffectiveness\nAt the time of the first interim analysis (Month 72), summaries of the incidence of HPV \n6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 related persistent infection for a duration of \u22656 \nmonths (within \u00b1 1 month windows) and cervical, vulvar, vaginal, perineal, perianal, and \npenile intraepithelial preinvasive and invasive disease, and external genital lesions will be \nprovided, separately for males and females. Similar summaries of the incidence rates of \nHPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58-related persistent infection for a duration of \u22656 \nmonths (within \u00b1 1 month windows) and disease will be provided to include follow-up \ndata through the second interim analysis at Month 96 and at the end of the study at Month \n126.  \nAll subjects will contribute to the effectiveness summaries.  Summaries will be provided \nby gender and age group (based on age at enrollment).  The primary analysis group will \nbe those who have received 3 doses of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine within one year.  \nSubjects will be considered breakthrough cases related to a given HPV type provided \nthey were negative to the respective HPV type by serology prior to vaccination and were \nsexually na\u00efve through the 3rd dose of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine. Sexual na\u00efvet\u00e9, an \ninclusion criterion for the base study, is being used as a way to limit analysis of the \nprophylactic effect of the vaccine to subjects who were not infected prior to completion \nof the vaccination series.  There are no PCR data from Protocol V503-002 subjects until \nsubjects reach their 16th birthday. Therefore, the only data available to assess possible \nprior infection are pre-vaccination serum anti-HPV levels and sexual history.

Baseline demographic characteristics, pre-vaccination \nanti-HPV serology status, and post-vaccination immunogenicity profiles will be \nconsidered. Incidence rates for the same endpoints caused by HPV types not contained in \nthe vaccine will also be summarized, when such data are available.  An additional \nanalysis of persistent infection for a duration of 12 months (within \u00b1 1 month windows)\nor more may be conducted.  \n2.7.3\nSafety analysis\nAll subjects who received at least one dose of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine and have \nlong-term study follow-up data will be included in the safety summaries. Listings of \nserious adverse experiences and deaths, and a pregnancy summary will be provided.\n2.7.4\nPower and sample size\nThe sample size for this long-term follow-up study is fixed by the number of Protocol \n002 participants who are eligible and willing to participate in the extension.  There is no \nformal hypothesis that will be tested in this long-term follow-up study.  A total of \napproximately 2600 subjects, 9 to 15 years of age, were enrolled in the V503-002 base \nstudy.\n2.7.5\nInterim Analysis\nInterim analyses will be conducted at Month 72 and Month 96 to assess the feasibility of \nobtaining 10 full years of follow-up.  The decision to continue with the effectiveness \ncomponent of the study will depend on the ability to collect sufficient effectiveness data \nobserved through Months 72 and 96, and anticipated through the remainder of the study.  \nSummaries of the incidence of persistent infection and cervical, vulvar, vaginal, perineal, \nperianal, and penile intraepithelial preinvasive and invasive disease, and external genital \nlesions related to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 will be provided separately for \nmales and females.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n21\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3.\nPROTOCOL DETAILS\n3.1\nRATIONALE\n3.1.1\nIntroduction to Human Papillomavirus\nHPV infection causes benign and malignant dysplastic disease, localized primarily in the \nanogenital area and aerodigestive tract, in both men and women [2; 3; 4].\n3.1.1.1 Disease Burden\nCervical Cancer and Precancerous Dysplasia.  Nearly 100% of cervical cancers are \ncaused by HPV infection [5; 6].  Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in \nwomen worldwide [7], with approximately 530,000 new cases diagnosed each year and \n275,000 annual deaths [8; 9].  Most (~80%) of the cases occur in developing countries.  \nIn developed countries, cervical cancer screening programs have reduced the incidence of \ncervical cancer by 75% due to the detection, follow-up, and treatment of premalignant \nlesions.  Despite this success, ~10,000 cases of cervical cancer still occur annually in the \nUS, causing over 3000 annual deaths [10; 11], and more than 30,000 cases of cervical \ncancer still occur annually in the European Union, causing over 13,000 annual deaths \n[12].  \nAnogenital Warts.  Anogenital warts are generally benign, exophytic, hyperkeratotic \nlesions appearing over the vulva, urethra, vagina, perineum, and anus in women, and on \nthe penile shaft (most common site of lesions), scrotum, perineum, and anus in men.  In \ngeneral, the lesions do not cause any physical discomfort [13].  Some patients experience \nitching, burning, bleeding, moisture, irritation or soreness, especially with lesions in the \nperianal region.  Patients are often distressed by unsightly lesions.  Treatment consists of \nchemical or physical ablation and is often unsuccessful. Recurrence rates are high [14].\nAnal, Vulvar, Vaginal and Penile Cancer.  Most anal cancers, and ~50% of vulvar, \nvaginal and penile cancers, are caused by HPV.  Rates of anal cancer (men and women) \nand HPV-related vulvar and vaginal cancers are increasing [5; 15].\nRecurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  RRP is a rare but severe disease that is \nmanifested as rapidly-growing exophytic warts in the upper airway, most often in the \nlarynx, causing severe respiratory and speech impairment.  Repeated surgical excision is \noften needed.  The disease tends to recur despite repeated treatment and can lead to death \nby blocking the airway.  RRP is primarily caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.  The disease \noccurs in both children and young adults [16; 17; 18; 19; 20].\nOther HPV-associated malignancies.  HPV causes ~25 to 30% of cancers of the oral \ncavity, oropharynx, and larynx [21].  When oropharyngeal cancers are considered alone, \nthe percentage caused by HPV is notably higher.  HPV may also be associated with \ncancers involving the aerodigestive tract, including cases of lung and esophageal cancers\n[22; 23], as well as bladder cancers [24].\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n22\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3.1.1.2 Biology of Human Papillomavirus\nHPV consist of a family of small, nonenveloped icosahedral capsid viruses containing \ndouble-stranded DNA composed of 8 early transcribed open reading frames, two late \nopen reading frames, and a non-coding long control region [25].  The Late (L) genes \nencode the 2 capsid proteins (L1, major capsid protein) and L2 (minor capsid protein).  \nEven though present in mature viral particles, L2 proteins are not necessary for capsid \nformation.  Proteins encoded on the early (E) portion of the genome are involved in viral \nDNA synthesis. E6 and E7 proteins induce epithelial cell hyperproliferation by inhibiting \ncell cycle regulatory proteins, a likely mechanism by which all HPV types cause aberrant \nproliferation of infected cells [26; 27].\nThe HPV family of viruses represents nearly 100 related epitheliotropic DNA viruses that \nhave been classified by types and species [28].  HPV types (also referred to as genotypes) \nare defined based on DNA sequencing [10].  Overall, 40 HPV types can infect the \nanogenital tract.  Although all HPV types appear to disrupt the cell cycle regulator \nmechanisms, true oncogenic potential is limited to a subset of HPV types.  Clinically, \nHPV types are classified into high-risk (HR) types (cancer-causing: i.e., in descending \norder of frequency in tumor specimens HPV 16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52, 58, 35, 59, 56, 39, 51, \n73, 66, 68) [10], and low-risk (LR) types (causing generally benign lesions: e.g., HPV 6, \n11, 42, 43, 44).\nPhylogenetically, HPV are classified into several species.  HPV types targeted by \nprophylactic HPV vaccines belong to Species A7, A9, and A10. Species A7 and A9 \ncontain most of the HR types.  The A7 Species includes HPV 18, 39, 45, 59, and 68.  The \nA9 Species includes HPV 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58.  HPV 16 and 18 are responsible for \nmost (~70%) cases of cervical cancer, with an additional ~20% due to HPV Types 31, 33, \n45, 52, and 58 [8].  The proportion of cervical cancers caused by types other than HPV 16 \nvaries by region.  For example, in Western countries, HPV 18 is the second most \ncommon cause of cervical cancer.  However, in East Asia, HPV 52 and 58 are \nresponsible for a higher proportion of cervical cancers than HPV 18. Species A10 \ncontains LR HPV Types 6 and 11, which are responsible for over 90% of anogenital \nwarts and RRP cases.  \nHPV infection and replication is entirely intraepithelial.  The basal cell of the epithelium \nis the primary target of HPV infection.  A minor lesion in the epithelium is enough to \nallow HPV to access this layer of cells [29].  Viral replication occurs only at a low level \nin the basal cells.  High-level viral protein expression is achieved in the middle or upper \nlayers of the epithelium.  These layers of epithelial cells are normally terminally \ndifferentiated.  However, with the up-regulation of viral proteins E6 and E7 that takes \nplace during HPV infection, these cells are maintained in a mitotically active state that is \nconducive to viral DNA and protein synthesis [30].  Viral assembly takes place only in \nterminally differentiated cells at the epithelium surface.  Viral shedding occurs through \nthe routine desquamation of dead epithelial cells [31; 32; 33]. \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n23\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3.1.1.3 Epidemiology of HPV Infection and Disease\n3.1.1.3.1\nHPV Infection\nThe cumulative lifetime risk for HPV infection in sexually active women exceeds 50%.  \nAvailable data suggest that HPV infection is also very prevalent in men [34; 35].  HPV \ninfection is transmitted via contact with an infected individual or a contaminated object \nand occurs most often during sexual activity.  Sixty percent (60%) of sexual partners of \ninfected individuals develop lesions 4 weeks to 8 months after exposure [36].  HPV is \noften acquired immediately after sexual debut.  The risk of HPV infection is strongly \ncorrelated with the number of lifetime sexual partners [37; 38].  Men and women in their \nlate teens and early twenties are at the highest risk for HPV infection, as early sexual \nactivity is accompanied with a higher likelihood of having new sexual partners, thus \nincreasing the risk of exposure to the virus.  The incidence of HPV infection in women \nincreases with age during the teen years and peaks in the early 20\u2019s and declines \ngradually thereafter [6; 39]. In contrast, there does not appear to be such an association \nbetween HPV prevalence and age in men. This difference between genders may reflect \nstronger immune response to HPV in women, as suggested by findings of higher \nprevalence of anti-HPV antibodies in women than in men across all ages [40]. Most \ncervical HPV infections resolve spontaneously. On average, HPV infection persists for 4 \nto 20 months. However, a small proportion of infections persist beyond 1 to 2 years. \nInfection with HR types tends to last longer than infection with low-risk (LR) types [41; \n42; 43; 44; 45].\n3.1.1.3.2\nCervical HPV Disease\nInfection with HPV is generally asymptomatic and not recognized until lesions are \nidentified.  Most HPV lesions are self-limited: for instance, early HPV disease causes \nlow-grade cervical dysplasia (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 1 [CIN 1]) which \nresolves in most cases without clinical sequelae.  In some cases however, HPV infection \npersists, leading to CIN 2/3 and cervical cancer [39]. CIN 2/3 encompasses moderate and \nhigh-grade cervical dysplasia and cervical carcinoma in situ. It is the immediate precursor \nto cervical cancer with high rates of progression to cervical cancer and low rates of \nregression to normal [46].  Determinants of progression versus clearance of HPV disease\nare not well defined.  Pap test screening programs have sharply reduced cervical cancer \nincidence [47] by allowing early detection and excision of CIN 2/3 lesions prior to cancer \ndevelopment [48; 49].  These benefits have not been shared in populations with sporadic\nscreening, especially in the developing world and among the disadvantaged in the US\n[50].\nIt appears that viral persistence, rather than transient viral infection, plays a key role in \ncervical carcinogenesis [51; 52; 53; 54; 55]. Risk of CIN and invasive cervical cancer \n(ICC) is strongly associated with persistent infection with HR types [56; 57; 39; 58; 59; \n60]. Persistent detection of HR HPV DNA is a predictor for progression to cervical \ncancer [39; 61; 62]. The risk of development of cervical lesions, which is highest for \nHPV 16, has also been demonstrated for other HR HPV types. The risk of progression to \nCIN increases with duration of viral persistence. However, a long period of infection \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n24\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n(e.g., > 1 year) is often not required for CIN development [63]. A strong association \nbetween 3 to 6 months persistent infection and subsequent development of CIN1 or \nworse has been demonstrated [64]. Based on all these observations, persistent infection \nwith at least 1 HR type is considered a key intermediate step for progression to cervical \ncancer. \nThe natural history of cervical HPV disease is represented schematically in Figure 3-1.\nFigure 3-1\nNatural History of Infection with High-Risk HPV Types (e.g., HPV 16 and HPV 18)\n3.1.1.3.3\nNon-Cervical HPV Disease\nInfection with HPV is also associated with vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, oral, and \noropharyngeal cancers [2; 3].  Each of these HPV-related diseases is much less frequent \nthan cervical cancer. But taken together, they represent a significant human health and \neconomic burden [34; 65].  Of particular concern, the incidence of anal cancer has been \nincreasing over the past several decades [66]. The risk of anal cancer is increased in men \nand women with a high number of sexual partners, current smokers, and among men who \nare not exclusively heterosexual or women by having sexual intercourse [67]. Anal \ncancer is preceded by high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) [68; 69]. Over 80% \nof anal cancers and over 90% of high-grade anal neoplasia contain HR-HPV [70]. The \nhigh proportion of HPV-positive tumors suggests that HPV infection is necessary for \ndeveloping anal cancer. HPV vaccination could prevent most anal cancers and \nprecancers.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n25\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3.1.1.3.4\nAspects of HPV Infection and Disease Specific to Men\nOnly a few prospective studies have examined the incidence and duration of genital HPV \ninfection in men. These studies indicate that HPV infection in men is self limited and a \nrisk factor for HPV genital disease. Most HPV infections in men appear to clear within \n12 months with a median time of clearance ranging from 5.9 to 7.5 months [71; 72]. HPV \n16 infections tend to last longer and clear at an average of 12.2 months [72]. HPV testing \npositive for HPV 6 or 11 is the strongest predictor of developing genital warts [73]. HPV \n16 infection is a recognized risk factor for penile cancer [74].\n3.1.1.4 Prophylactic HPV Vaccines\n3.1.1.4.1\nImmune Response to HPV Natural Infection and HPV Vaccination\nBy remaining exclusively intraepithelial, HPV largely avoids exposure to the host \nimmune system and evades immune recognition, which allows HPV infection to proceed\n[10; 75; 76].  Other mechanisms inhibiting the immune response are also used by HPV to \navoid immune surveillance and control [77].  Accordingly, immune responses to natural \nviral infection are poor.  In particular, low-level antibody responses to HPV become \ndetectable only several months after the infection and in only approximately 50% of the \nsubjects [78].  Nonetheless, most HPV infections are eventually cleared.  It is thought \nthat naturally acquired immune responses contribute to the clearance of infection, \nalthough the mechanisms are not well elucidated [79].  Those infections that are not \ncleared (especially the high-risk types) can result in dysplasia and cancer.\nProphylactic HPV vaccines have been developed based on VLPs which are produced by \nself-assembly of recombinant HPV L1 capsid proteins expressed in a heterologous cell \nsubstrate.  VLPs mimic the overall structure of HPV virions, thus keeping capsid proteins \nin their native antigenic conformation.  HPV vaccines are delivered intramuscularly and \ninduce high levels of type-restricted neutralizing antibodies to L1 and seroconversion in \nvirtually 100% of the vaccinated subjects.  \n3.1.1.4.2\nQuadrivalent HPV (qHPV) Vaccine\n3.1.1.4.2.1\nPhase III Clinical Studies\nAs of July 2012, the quadrivalent (Type 6, 11, 16, 18) HPV L1 VLP vaccine (qHPV \nvaccine) was approved and marketed under the name GARDASIL\u2122/SILGARD\u2122 in \nover 120 countries.  A 0.5-mL dose of vaccine contains 20 \u03bcg HPV Type 6 L1 VLP, 40 \n\u03bcg HPV Type 11 L1 VLP, 40 \u03bcg HPV Type 16 L1 VLP, 20 \u03bcg HPV Type 18 L1 VLP, \nand 225 \u03bcg of the adjuvant Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate (AAHS).  \nIn clinical trials in 16 to 26-year-old women, qHPV vaccine was over 94% efficacious in \npreventing the development of:  HPV 16- and 18-related CIN 2/3 and adenocarcinoma in \nsitu (obligate cervical cancer precursors); HPV 16- and 18-related Vulvar Intraepithelial \nNeoplasia (VIN) 2/3 and Vaginal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VaIN) 2/3 (obligate \nprecursors to HPV-related vulvar and vaginal cancer, respectively); HPV 6- and 11-\nrelated external genital lesions (including condyloma acuminata); HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n26\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n18-related CIN; and HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related persistent infection [80].  Efficacy \nwas maintained for at least 5 years post-vaccination onset [81].  The vaccine also \nafforded some cross-protection against other oncogenic HPV types [82; 83; 84].  \nHowever, cross-protection was incomplete and limited to only a few types. In addition, in \na Phase III study (V501 Protocol 020), the qHPV vaccine was over 89% efficacious in \npreventing the development of HPV 6- or 11-related genital warts in 16- to 26-year-old \nmales [85], and 77.5% efficacious in preventing AIN in 16- to 26-year-old men-having-\nsex-with-men (MSM) [86].\n3.1.1.4.2.2\nEcological Studies \nAustralia has been the first country to introduce a fully funded national HPV vaccination \nprogram. The program, targeted to adolescent females 12 to 13 years of age, was started \nin April 2007. In addition, up to 31-Dec-2009, a catch-up vaccination program was \noffered to girls and women, 14 to 26 years of age [87]. Within approximately 3 years \nfollowing implementation of this qHPV vaccination program, a decline was observed in \nthe diagnosis of genital warts among young Australian women [88]. Moreover, a \ndecrease was noted in incidence of high-grade cervical abnormalities in girls less than 18 \nyears of age [89]. A subsequent study reported the near disappearance of genital warts in \nyoung women and young heterosexual men within approximately 4 years following \nimplementation of this vaccination program [90]. Overall, these observations suggest a \nrapid, beneficial effect of mass vaccination with qHPV vaccine. Dramatic fall in disease \nincidence following vaccine introduction, a typical pattern previously observed after \nintroduction of mass vaccination with a number of new vaccines, appears also verified \nwith qHPV vaccine. The decline in genital warts among Australian men (who are not part \nof the mass vaccination program) indicates that the concept of herd protection, previously \nnoted with other vaccines, is also applicable to prophylactic HPV vaccination.\n3.1.1.4.3\nV503: 9-valent Prophylactic HPV Vaccine\nThe 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine formulated with AAHS consists of highly purified \nVLPs of the L1 capsid proteins from HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Like for \nGARDASIL\u2122, the L1 capsid proteins in the vaccine are individually expressed in \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. The HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 L1 VLPs \nfinal aqueous products consist of recombinant L1 polypeptides for their respective viral \ntypes that have self-assembled into VLPs. Following fermentation, the VLPs are isolated \nfrom lysed yeast cells by standard techniques, then highly purified, and then adsorbed \nonto AAHS without the addition of preservative. After preparation of the Monovalent \nBulk Adsorbed Products, the bulks are mixed to create the 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine \nwith the desired concentrations of each monovalent L1 VLP. The 9-valent HPV L1 VLP \nvaccine is not a live virus vaccine. It is not capable of causing viral infection.\nHPV 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers worldwide.  Approximately \n20% of additional cervical cancers are caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.  The \naddition of HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 L1 VLPs to the 4 types already present in qHPV \nvaccine will thus increase overall cervical cancer coverage from approximately 70% to \napproximately 90% [91; 92]. Assuming at least 90% vaccine efficacy, this coverage may \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n27\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nprovide 80% or greater reduction in cervical cancer risk (matching or exceeding the \nefficacy of most cervical cancer screening programs). A small increase in coverage of \nanal, vulvar, and vaginal cancers and precancers is also anticipated.\n3.1.2\nRationale for This Study\n3.1.2.1 Rationale for Assessment of Long Term Effectiveness\nProtocol V503-002, a 12-month immunogenicity and safety study of V503 in \npreadolescent and adolescent girls and boys, showed that V503 is highly immunogenic \nand generally well-tolerated in the study population.  Girls and boys enrolled in V503-\n002 are being followed for 24 additional months under Study Extension V503-002-10, to \nassess persistence of antibody responses and long term safety.\nTaken together, the Protocol V503-002 base study and V503-002-10 study extension will \nprovide immunogenicity and safety data through approximately 36 months of study \nfollow-up. Efficacy data were not collected in V503-002 and V503-002-10 because \nevaluation of sexual history and gynecological/genital examination is limited in young \nadolescents by social, cultural, and legal constraints. Nonetheless, data on the long term \nimmunogenicity, safety, and effectiveness of V503 administered to preadolescent and \nadolescent girls and boys will support ongoing use of the vaccine in this important target \npopulation.  \nIn the current protocol, immunogenicity and safety information will be collected for all \nsubjects, and effectiveness endpoints will be assessed in subjects who have reached 16 \nyears of age. Collection of efficacy data will be dependent on age and gender. Data \npermitting, the protocol will evaluate the long term effectiveness of V503 in preventing \nHPV persistent infection as well as HPV disease caused by HPV types targeted by V503, \nincluding external genital warts in both genders; cervical, vulvar, and vaginal \nintraepithelial neoplasia, and associated cancers in female subjects; penile, perineal, and \nperianal intraepithelial neoplasia, and associated cancers in male subjects. \n3.1.2.2 Rationale for Including Male Subjects\nHPV vaccination could contribute to reducing the burden of HPV diseases in males. The \nqHPV vaccine is highly efficacious to prevent genital warts as well as anal cancer and \nprecancers in males. Additional benefits of vaccination may include coverage of other \nHPV-related cancers (i.e., head and neck cancer, penile cancer) for which prophylactic \nvaccine efficacy has not been studied but is biologically plausible. In contrast to cervical \ncancer in women, there is no widespread screening program for any of the HPV-related \ncancers in men. Thus, prophylactic vaccination is the only realistic preventive measure \nfor HPV diseases in men, in both developed and developing countries. \nA number of observations suggest that HPV transmission is a risk for development of \nHPV disease in both men and women. Male factors, such as lack of circumcision (which \npromotes chronic HPV infection in men), type-specific HPV infection, and viral load of \nsuch infection, are important correlates for HPV infection and disease in their female \npartners [93; 94; 95; 96]. Penile lesions are frequent in sexual partners of women with \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n28\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nCIN [97; 98]. Regression of penile lesions is significantly slower in men whose partners \nare infected with the same HPV type [99]. Husbands of women with cervical cancer or \ncervical carcinoma in situ have a higher HPV prevalence than husbands of control \nwomen [100]. The risk of cervical cancer is also increased by certain behaviors of male \npartners, such as having multiple sex partners and contact with prostitutes [101; 102].\nThus, vaccination of men could promote herd protection and lead to a substantial \nreduction of HPV-related diseases in both males and females [35].\nPrevious public health experience has shown that gender-restricted vaccination programs \nare substantially less effective than universal vaccination. It is likely that the most \neffective means to reduce the burden of HPV disease through vaccination is to vaccinate \nboth males and females. As illustrated by the Australian experience, the concept of herd \nprotection is applicable to HPV prophylactic vaccination. Thus, in the setting of a \nprotective intervention that provides less than 100% protection to the entire female \npopulation (i.e., less than 100% efficacy and/or less than 100% coverage), reducing the \nburden of HPV disease would likely be enhanced by gender neutral vaccination through \nthe establishment of herd protection.\n3.2\nSTUDY PROCEDURES\n3.2.1\nPrerequisites for Study Visits With Gynecological or Genitourinary \nSpecimen Collection\nAll subjects 16 years of age and older will have gynecological (female subjects) or \ngenitourinary (male subjects) specimens collected during study visits. This section \nsummarizes prerequisites for visits with collection of such specimens. Deviations from \nthese prerequisites require consultation between the investigator and the SPONSOR and \nwritten documentation of the collaborative decision. See the Administrative Binder for a \nsummary of deviations that require documentation in this study\nFor visits that include collection of study specimens, study personnel should verify by \nquestioning the subject and/or by examination that: \n1.

(Female subjects only) \u2013 The subject does not have visible blood in the vagina.  As a \nguide, a study visit that  includes collection of LVPP/EEC swabs, a Pap test, and/or \nbiopsies/definitive therapy specimens should not be scheduled between the time \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n29\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nperiod of 2 days prior to menses (if date of menses can be predicted) to 2 days after \nmenses. If, despite using these collection timeframe guidelines, visible blood is noted \nin the vagina, then the specimens may be collected.  \n4. (Female subjects only) \u2013 The subject does not have gross purulent cervicitis at a study \nvisit that includes collection of LVPP/EEC swabs, a Pap test, and/or cervical\nbiopsies/definitive therapy specimens. \n5. (Male subjects only) \u2013 The subject has refrained from shaving his genital region \n(and/or applying any post-shave solutions or lubricants) a minimum of 1 day prior to \nthe visit as this may interfere with the collection of skin cells. If the subject has \nshaved, or applied lotions or lubricants within 24 hours, the scheduled visit, exam, \nand specimen collection will be postponed until this criterion has been met.\nIf the subject does not meet the requirements listed above, the study visit (including \nspecimen collection and/or study vaccination) should be re-scheduled.  If the subject has \ngross purulent cervicitis, the re-scheduled study visit should occur after the condition is \ndiagnosed and treated according to the study site's standards and practices.\n3.2.2\nSummary of Scheduled Study Visit Procedures\nThe Study Flow Chart summarizes procedures for scheduled study visits and items \nappear in the order they should be performed.  This section provides clarifications to the \nscheduled study visit procedures (presented in order of the Study Flow Chart).  \n3.2.2.1 Calculation of Schedule Visit Windows\nThe visit windows provided in this protocol are for site scheduling purposes. The visit \nwindows used for exclusion from analyses are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan \n(Section 3.5). The Day 1 visit was defined as the day that the first study vaccination was \ngiven during the V503-002 Base Study. The Month 6 visit (when the third vaccination \nwas given during the Base Study) was based on Day 1 and had a \uf0b14 weeks visit window. \nThe Month 36 visit in Extension 002-10 was based on Month 6 and had \uf0b14 weeks visit \nwindow. The Month 42 visit in Extension 002-20 is based on Month 36 and has \uf0b14 weeks\nvisit window. The other study visits in Extension 002-20 are each based on Month 42 and \nhave a \uf0b14 weeks visit window. To calculate visit windows, assume 1 month equals 30 \ndays and 1 week equals 7 days. \n3.2.2.2 Informed Consent\nWritten consent will be obtained for each subject (or, for minors, from the parent/legal \nguardian and the subject) prior to enrollment, study data collection, or performance of \nstudy procedures.  A copy of the signed informed consent form will be given to each \nsubject for his or her records.  Verification of the subject\u2019s identity and age is to be \ndetermined prior to obtaining written consent.  Any government-issued photo \nidentification will suffice for verification purposes and should be documented in the \nsubject\u2019s file.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n30\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nThe assent/consent for the V503-002-20 Extension can be collected at the Month 36 visit \n(if possible), or can be administered prior to serum collection at the Month 42 visit.\n3.2.2.3 Randomization/Allocation\nSubjects were randomized in the Protocol V503-002 Base Study and will retain their \nbaseline and allocation numbers from those studies.\nA single patient/subject cannot be assigned more than 1 allocation number.\n3.2.2.4 Patient ID Card\nAll subjects/patients will be given a card, at the time of screening, identifying them as \nparticipants in a research study.  The card will contain contact information (including \ndirect telephone numbers) to be utilized in the event of an emergency.\n3.2.2.5 History and Medication\nNo study vaccinations will be administered during the follow-up period. If an investigator \ndiscovers that a subject received an additional dose of any marketed HPV vaccine\nunintentionally outside the context of the study, this should be reported to the Sponsor.  \nLimited new medical history information will be collected to include:\n\uf0b7\nEvents of acquired immunodeficiency\no\nHIV infection\no\nHematological malignancies (e.g, leukemia, lymphoma)\no\nImmunosuppressive therapy or procedure such as radiation therapy, \ncytotoxic or immunosuppressive chemotherapy, high-dose corticosteroids \n(at least 2 weeks), immunosuppressive monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., \nanti-CD20, anti-TNF-alpha), splenectomy, or any other therapy or \nprocedure known to interfere with the immune response. \n\uf0b7\nAdministration of a marketed HPV vaccine outside the context of the study.\n\uf0b7\nAny gynecological or genitourinary procedure or condition that may interfere \nwith the evaluation of vaccine effectiveness (e.g., subject had hysterectomy, \nsubject has more than 1 cervix uteri).\n\uf0b7\nAny condition that may be relevant to the evaluation of the vaccine.\n3.2.2.6 Sexual History and Contraception Information\nAt the first visit after a subject reaches 16 years of age, the subject\u2019s lifetime sexual\nhistory will be collected.

For these additional local laboratory \ntests for chlamydia and gonorrhea, the study site will collect samples using their own \nmaterials. Subjects who test positive for STIs may remain in the study. All subjects who \ntest positive for STIs should be referred for counseling and treatment. It is important to \ndocument all tests for STIs on the appropriate eCRF as discussed in the eCRF Entry \nGuidelines.  Testing for STIs should be done after gynecologic and genitourinary \nexamination and sample collection.\n3.2.2.10\nGynecological or Genitourinary Examination and Sample Collection\nThere will be no gynecological or genitourinary examination and sample collection in \nsubjects who are less than 16 years of age.\nOnce a subject becomes 16 years of age, gynecological or genitourinary examination and \nsample collection will be performed at every study visit. Gynecological examination and \nsample collection in female subjects will be different in subjects 16 to 20 years of age \nwho are not sexually active, subjects 16 to 20 years of age who are sexually active, and \nsubjects \u226521 years of age. In this context, 'sexually active' is defined as having had \nvaginal penetration.

A discordant diagnosis will require a \nreview of the results by the Sponsor-designated Central Laboratory.  Upon completion of \nthe review, a consultation report will be sent to the investigator.  If the results are \namended upon completion of this review, the protocol-mandated colposcopy triage \nalgorithm (Table 3-1) and guidelines for cervical definitive therapy (Table 3-2) should be \nfollowed.   If the discordant results are reviewed but not amended, see Table 3-2 and the \nMandatory Regimen for Triage Attachment (Figure 4) for guidelines.\nSubjects will be referred for cervical definitive therapy according to Table 3-2. If cervical \ndefinitive therapy is performed, on the day of the procedure, pre-definitive cervical \nbiopsies must be taken of the areas with the most severe abnormalities prior to \nperforming the cervical definitive therapy. Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure \n(LEEP) is the preferred method for cervical definitive therapy. LEEP has \ncontraindications for subjects with the following conditions:  allergy to all local \nanesthetics; pregnancy; severe acute cervicitis (severe acute cervicitis should be \ndiagnosed and treated, and excision conducted after the infection has resolved); obvious \ninvasive cancer; significant glandular neoplasia (AGUS favor neoplasia, AIS, \nAdenocarcinoma); and microinvasive cancer.  In addition to LEEP, laser conization is \nalso acceptable if it is the standard of care at the study site.  Cold-knife conization and \nablative cervical definitive therapy (e.g., cervical cryotherapy or cervical laser \nvaporization) should be reserved for rare instances where cervical definitive therapy is \nrequired and LEEP or laser conization is not indicated.  LEEP, laser conization, and cold-\nknife conization are study procedures, but ablative cervical definitive therapy is not a \nstudy procedure because this procedure is not tissue preserving.  \nTable 3-2\nProtocol-Mandated Guidance for Referral to Cervical Definitive Therapy\nBiopsy Results that Require Cervical Definitive Therapy\nCervical biopsy result or ECC result of CIN 2\u2020, CIN 3, Adenocarcinoma in Situ (AIS), or cervical cancer.\nCervical biopsy (including ECC, if taken) result of CIN 1 on at least 2 consecutive biopsies for a duration of 18 months or longer\u2020.\nDiscordant Case Guidance for Cervical Definitive Therapy \n(After Discordant Case Review Confirms Discrepancy)\nIf colposcopic examination was unsatisfactory-  \nCervical Definitive Therapy  required.\nHigh Grade Pap Result (AGC [to include AIS, atypical endocervical cells, \nadenocarcinoma, etc.)], ASC-H, or HSIL), negative vaginal examination, \ncervical biopsy/ECC is CIN 1 (or less) or if no lesion is seen and cervical \nbiopsy/ECC is not taken:\nIf colposcopic examination was satisfactory- See \nAttachment (Mandatory Regimen for Triage, Figure \n4) for guidance. \u2021\n\u2020\nManagement of women \u2264 20 years of age should be consistent with local standards of care and may include observation in these \ninstances. \n\u2021\nTwo repeat High Grade Pap diagnoses (regardless of whether they are consecutive or not) without a confirmed  cervical biopsy \nor ECC diagnosis of CIN 2, CIN 3, or cervical cancer will be referred to definitive therapy.\nGeneral Notes:\nPre-definitive cervical biopsies must be obtained on the day of the cervical definitive therapy procedure and must be taken before \nthe cervical definitive therapy procedure is performed.\nAblative cervical definitive therapy is not a study procedure. \nDeviations to the protocol-mandated guidance for referral to cervical definitive therapy and the footnotes in this table require \nconsultation between the investigator and the SPONSOR and written documentation of the collaborative decision.

Separate biopsy forceps must be \nused for each of the discrete lesions that are biopsied. See Section 3.2.4 for detailed \nguidance on colposcopy, biopsy, ECC, and cervical definitive therapy procedures.\nSubjects who undergo cervical biopsy and/or cervical definitive therapy will continue to \nbe followed through the completion of scheduled study visits.  The interval between a \ncervical biopsy and/or cervical definitive therapy and the next scheduled visit that \nincludes a pelvic exam must be at least 2 months.  Follow-up care after cervical definitive \ntherapy will occur according to the study site\u2019s standards and practices.\nColposcopy, biopsy, and ECC procedures must be performed by an experienced health \ncare professional (>50 colposcopies per year for at least 2 years).  The cervical definitive \ntherapy provider should be an experienced physician (defined as performing 20 LEEP \nprocedures per year for at least 2 years) and must have documented formal instruction \n[i.e., residency or postgraduate course or American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical \nPathology (ASCCP) training course].  To ensure that colposcopy practices and skill \nlevels are standardized across study sites, and that colposcopists at all sites develop a \nuniform approach to all study colposcopies, study colposcopists will be required to \nparticipate in colposcopic standardization training.  The purpose of this training is to \nevaluate the colposcopic practices at all study sites, to standardize colposcopy and biopsy \npractices, and to provide a guide for all aspects of the protocol related to colposcopy and \nhistological sampling of the cervix.  An alternative to the SPONSOR-organized \ncolposcopy training, the \u201cComprehensive Colposcopy Course\u201d given by the ASCCP, will \nbe accepted as equivalent for the purpose of standardization to participate in this study, \nprovided it has been taken within the previous year.\n3.2.3.1.2\nExternal Genital Lesion and Vaginal Lesion Diagnosis and Follow-Up\nExternal genital lesions or vaginal lesions may be identified during a scheduled visit \nexam, Pap test, colposcopic examination, or at any other time during the study. For the \npurposes of this study, lesions that require access via the introitus (with the exception of \nthe cervix, which is considered a separate location) are to be defined as vaginal lesions. \nLesions that are external to the introitus are to be defined as external genital lesions. To \nclassify the location of external genital lesions, the external genital area will be further \ndivided into the following 4 regions:\n\uf0b7\nperiurethral (includes the clitoris)\n\uf0b7\nperineal\n\uf0b7\nperianal\n\uf0b7\nvulvar (includes all areas other than the periurethral, perineal or perianal regions)\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n42\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nIt is important to make an accurate evaluation of any identified external genital lesions.  \nThe practitioner must classify a lesion as condyloma acuminata, other HPV-related lesion \n(e.g., a flat wart, a papular wart, a keratotic wart, VIN, Bowenoid papulosis, Bowen\u2019s \ndisease) or a non HPV-related lesion.  If lesions are identified, they must be documented \non the appropriate eCRF.  \nExternal genital lesions suspected to be possibly, probably, or definitely HPV-related \n(i.e., clinical impression of condyloma acuminata or other HPV-related lesion) or of \nunknown etiology are to be biopsied.  Separate biopsies should be performed if external \ngenital lesions are at different locations (periurethral, perineal, perianal, or vulvar region) \nor if more than one external genital lesion is at the same location and has a different \nmorphology. An additional external genital lesion biopsy should be obtained if a new \nHPV-related lesion (or lesion of unknown etiology) appears and is of differing \nmorphology and/or differing location from the initial lesion(s).  A recurrent lesion should \nnot be biopsied.  A recurrent external genital lesion is defined as a lesion that has both of \nthe following characteristics: (1) appears within 2 months of the complete resolution of \nan initial lesion(s) and (2) has the same location and a similar morphology as the initial \nlesion(s).  If an HPV-related lesion or a lesion of unknown etiology appears after 2 \nmonths of complete resolution of the initial lesion(s), a biopsy of the lesion should be \ntaken.   \nVaginal lesions suspected to be possibly, probably, or definitely HPV-related (i.e.,\ncondyloma acuminata or other HPV-related lesion) or of unknown etiology are to be \nbiopsied.  Separate biopsies should be performed for each vaginal lesion with a different \nmorphology. An additional vaginal biopsy should be obtained if a new potentially or \ndefinitely HPV-related lesion (or lesion of unknown etiology) appears and is of differing \nmorphology from the initial lesion(s).  A recurrent lesion should not be biopsied.  A \nrecurrent vaginal lesion is defined as a lesion that has both of the following \ncharacteristics: (1) appears within 2 months of the complete resolution of an initial \nlesion(s) and (2) has a similar morphology as the initial lesion(s).  If an HPV-related \nlesion or a lesion of unknown etiology appears after 2 months of complete resolution of \nthe initial lesion(s), a biopsy of the lesion should be taken.\nExternal genital lesion biopsies and vaginal lesion biopsies must be sent to the \nSPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory for analysis. Separate biopsy forceps must be \nused for each of the discrete lesions that are biopsied. Biopsy of an external genital lesion \nor vaginal lesion should ideally be performed on the same day that the lesion is first \nobserved, because the lesion may resolve before the subject returns for a biopsy \nprocedure if it is performed at a later time.  See Section 3.2.4 for detailed guidance on \nthese procedures.\nSubjects with histologically confirmed HPV-related external genital warts (e.g., \ncondyloma acuminata, VIN, cancer) or vaginal warts (e.g., condyloma acuminata, VaIN, \ncancer) will be referred to colposcopy if the external genital or vaginal biopsies were not \nobtained during a colposcopy (see Section 3.2.4).

After a biopsy \nis obtained, management and treatment of external genital lesions and vaginal lesions are \nat the investigator's discretion and according to the study site's standards and practices. If \nexcision is chosen as the method of treatment, all excised tissue is to be submitted to the \nSPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory for analysis.  The interval between the \nexternal genital lesion biopsy/excision or vaginal lesion biopsy/excision and the next \nscheduled visit involving a pelvic exam must be at least 2 months. External genital lesion \nbiopsy/excision and vaginal lesion biopsy/excision must be performed by an experienced \nhealth care professional.   \n3.2.3.1.3\nProcessing of Tissue Specimens in the Context of the Study\nExtra visits that are associated with tissue excision (cervical, vaginal, external genital, \nand cervical definitive therapy samples) will be considered part of the study.  Any \nspecimens collected will be obtained as described in the protocol and collected and \nshipped as described in the Laboratory Manual provided by the SPONSOR/Central \nLaboratory. Slides of tissue specimens will be prepared at the SPONSOR-designated \nCentral Laboratory and reviewed by a pathologist, and reports will be provided to the \nstudy sites for subject management.  \nAll tissue slides will be reviewed by the HPV Vaccine Program\u2019s expert Pathology Panel\n(See Section 3.3.3).  The consensus diagnosis of HPV Vaccine Program Pathology Panel \nwill represent the final diagnosis for study purposes and not for subject management. \nAlso, all tissue will be tested at MRL for detection of HPV types by PCR assay (See \nSection 3.3.2). The SPONSOR and the HPV Vaccine Program Pathology Panel will \nfollow established guidelines for review of the slides.  The investigator will be notified of \nany histological diagnosis made by the HPV Vaccine Program Pathology Panel that is \nmore severe than the one made by the SPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory. \n3.2.3.1.4\nPap Tests and Tissue Specimens Taken Outside the Context of the \nStudy\nCervical, vaginal, and external genital tissue samples and Pap tests collected outside the \ncontext of the study are strongly discouraged. For procedures with sample collection, \n\u201coutside the context of the study\u201d is defined as processing of samples at a local laboratory \nrather than through the SPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory.  For procedures \nwithout sample collection, such as a colposcopy without biopsy, \u201coutside the context of \nthe study\u201d means a procedure performed by a non-study clinician.  If a subject undergoes \na study procedure outside the context of the study, all efforts will be made to obtain and \nsend the following to the SPONSOR:  (1) Pap or colposcopy/operative report; (2) \ndiagnostic slides (for tissue biopsies only); (3) local pathology report; and (4) tissue block \nfor diagnostic slide preparation and HPV analysis\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n44\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3.2.3.2 Unscheduled Study Visits/Follow-up Procedures in Male Subjects\n3.2.3.2.1\nExternal Genital Lesion Diagnosis \nAfter a thorough external genital lesion examination, the investigator\u2019s clinical \nimpression should be recorded.  If a lesion, in the investigator\u2019s opinion, is possibly, \nprobably, or definitely HPV infection-related or the diagnosis is unknown, it should be \nbiopsied for further evaluation.  For multiple lesions, select one external lesion to biopsy \nthat is most representative of the morphology or anatomic location, and is most \naccessible.  A second biopsy is indicated, if a lesion is identified in a separate region \n(anterior region includes penis and scrotum and posterior region includes perineal and \nperianal region) or a lesion is identified with different morphology in the same region.  \nFor each biopsy, different instruments are to be used to prevent cross-contamination \nbetween specimens.  At the investigator\u2019s discretion, the lesion(s) may be surgically \nremoved (therapeutic excision).  In that case, the entire specimen must be submitted for \nanalysis.  All specimen(s) excised should be submitted to the central laboratory \ndesignated by the SPONSOR for analysis.  For the genital wart/lesion biopsy, the \nexternal genital lesion biopsy kit provided by the SPONSOR central laboratory is to be \nused.  Slides of the wart/lesion biopsy will be reviewed by a pathologist for the purpose \nof management of the subject.  Management of anogenital warts is a study procedure, but \nthe decision regarding the modality of therapy will be left to the discretion of the \ninvestigator, per the site\u2019s standard and practices.  Excision of the wart/lesion is the \npreferred study treatment.  All excised tissue is to be submitted to the central laboratory \nfor analysis.  If more than one biopsy is performed, then use separate instruments for \neach biopsy.  Each biopsy should be placed in individual formalin containers.  Treatment \nof anogenital warts by topical medications or cryotherapy is an acceptable study \nprocedure.  A biopsy of the identified lesion/lesions (e.g., morphology differs among \nidentified lesions or more than one lesion is identified) must be obtained prior to \nadministering treatment.  \nThe investigator should provide a clinical impression of the lesion, which should include \none of the following: condyloma acuminata, other HPV-related lesion (e.g., Bowenoid \npapulosis, Bowen\u2019s disease), or other non-HPV related lesions. \nThe location of all lesions that are being submitted for biopsy should be clearly identified \non the study operative report form located in the administrative binder.\nThe location and anatomical area of each biopsied wart/lesion should be identified and \nnoted (as per the lab kit requisition supplied by the SPONSOR and should also be \nrecorded on the workbook/case report form).\n3.2.3.2.2\nProcessing of Tissue Specimens in the Context of the Study \nExtra visits that are associated with external genital tissue excision will be considered \npart of the study.

When collecting swab specimens, remember \nto keep all swab tips and swab shafts (i.e., the portion that will be placed in the STM) \nuntouched. \n1. Remove female swabs from packaging.  \n2. Using the first swab, swab back and forth in a tight zigzag motion from the clitoral \nprepuce down to the posterior fourchette on first one side and then the other, so two\nparallel zigzag paths down the perineum will allow collection between the folds of \nthe labia minora and majora.\n3. With the second swab, swab the perianal area.\n4. Place both swabs in the appropriately labeled collection/transport tube containing \nSTM.  Break off the end of the shafts protruding from the tube by bending them \nsharply against the rim of the tube.  The shafts are pre-scored to facilitate breakage.\n5. Securely cap the collection/transport tube containing the specimen.\n6.

Using a plastic spatula, scrape the ectocervix in a 360\u00b0 arc for 2 full rotations, being \nsure to include the squamocolumnar junction in the portion sampled.  Place the \nspatula into the open PreservCyt\u2122 vial, using vigorous shaking and swishing of the \nspatula to rinse all of the cellular debris from the spatula.  It is acceptable to leave the \nspatula in the open PreservCyt\u2122vial until the cytobrush collection is completed.\n2. Insert a cytobrush3 into the cervical os, and slowly rotate 1/2 full turn one direction.  \nDO NOT OVER-ROTATE.  Do not insert deeper than the length of the brush head.  \nPlace the cytobrush immediately into the PreservCyt\u2122vial.\n3. Use the spatula to rub against the cytobrush in order to dislodge as much cellular \ndebris from the cytobrush and spatula as possible.  Swish and rinse the cytobrush, and \nknock it against the side of the PreservCyt\u2122 vial at least 10 times to release enough \n                                                \n3 The use of a cytobrush (Cytobrush\u2122) for ThinPrep\u2122 Pap test collection is contraindicated in women \nwho are 10 weeks pregnant or more, according to the current manufacturer\u2019s label. The use of a broom \n(Wallach Papette\u2122) for ThinPrep\u2122 Pap test collection is not contraindicated in pregnancy, according to \nthe current manufacturer\u2019s label.

Store PreservCyt\u2122 vials containing \nthe specimens at room temperature until they are shipped to the Central Laboratory.\nAccording the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, ThinPrep\u2122 specimens must be processed \nwithin 21 days of collection to preserve sample integrity.  To meet this requirement, \nspecimens must be shipped according to instructions and time intervals specified in \nthe Laboratory Manual that is provided by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory.\n6. Prior to removal of the speculum, inspect the lateral walls of the vagina for vaginal \nlesions. Then collapse the speculum and rotate 90 degrees and re-open the blades to \ninspect the anterior and posterior walls of the vagina for vaginal lesions. If vaginal \nlesions are present, use the guidance given in the protocol to classify vaginal lesions \nand to obtain required biopsies (see Sections 3.2.3.1.2).  Collapse and remove the \nspeculum.\n7. Change gloves and perform a systematic inspection of the entire external genitalia \nusing a good light source and a hand-held magnifying glass (4x to 5x power) or, \noptionally, a colposcope with low-power magnification. If external genital lesions are \npresent, use the guidance given in the protocol to classify external genital lesions and \nto obtain required biopsies (see Sections 3.2.3.1.2 and 3.2.4.2.4).\n3.2.4.2.4\nExternal Genital Lesion Biopsy and Vaginal Lesion Biopsy\nUse the appropriate eCRFs to note locations, clinical impressions, and biopsy numbers \nduring the procedure.  Use the specimen collection kits (labels/requisition) and formalin \nfixative container provided by the SPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory.  The \nexternal genital biopsy kit should be used for external genital biopsies and the vaginal \nbiopsy kit should be used for vaginal biopsies.  \n1. Cleanse the biopsy area with antiseptic solution. Using a 30-gauge needle and a \nsyringe of 1 to 2 mL of 1% lidocaine or bacteriostatic saline, infiltrate below the \nepidermis of the lesion.\n2. Elevate the lesion and remove tangentially with fine (iris) scissors or a scalpel blade \nto obtain the specimen.\n3. Place the biopsy piece in the fixative container and ensure proper labeling of the \nsample as specified in the Laboratory Manual that is provided by the \nSPONSOR/Central Laboratory.  \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n49\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n4. If multiple biopsies are obtained, each specimen must be placed in a separate \ncontainer of fixative.  To prevent cross-contamination, a different set of instruments is \nto be used for each biopsy taken. A maximum of 6 external genital lesion biopsies \nand 3 vaginal biopsies should be obtained.\n5. If the biopsy procedure does not remove the entire lesion(s) and surgical excision is \nchosen as a treatment method, the excised tissue is to be submitted to the Central \nLaboratory in a separate container of fixative and labeled as an additional biopsy.  \n6. To promote hemostasis after the procedure, apply gentle pressure.  Monsel\u2019s solution \nmay be used.  For larger areas, a single interrupted suture may be used.  \nElectrocauterization is to be avoided, but the decision is left to the discretion of the \npractitioner.\n7. Advise the patient to keep the area clean and to expect spotting for 3 days with \nhealing by 1 week.\nOn the day of collection, ship the sample at room temperature as specified in the \nLaboratory Manual that is provided by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory.\n3.2.4.2.5\nColposcopy Guidelines\nIn order for a colposcopy to be considered satisfactory, the entire transformation zone, \nincluding all of the squamocolumnar junction, and the limits of all lesions must be \nvisualized.\n1. Assist patient to dorsal lithotomy position.\n2. Insert speculum and visualize the entire cervix through the colposcope at low power.\n3. Use optional visualization adjuncts (i.e., condom or rubber glove finger \u201ctube\u201d over \nspeculum, lateral side-wall retractor) if necessary to enhance colposcopic \nvisualization.\n4. Remove mucus and debris by liberally applying 5% acetic acid to the cervix using \ncotton balls and ring forceps, large cotton swabs, or by spray technique.  Avoid use of \n4\u00d74 gauze pads.\n5. Reapply acetic acid (or Lugol\u2019s solution) to the cervix for a minimum of 60 seconds.  \nThereafter, reapply acetic acid every 3 to 5 minutes or when the columnar epithelium \nis no longer blanched white.\n6. Identify the entire squamocolumnar junction (360\u00b0), if able.\n7. Identify acetowhite cervical lesions if present.\n8. Assess the severity of each cervical lesion using green filter as needed to examine the \nvascular patterns.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n50\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n9. As a guide, use the Reid Colposcopic Index (RCI), which is provided in the \nAdministrative Binder, to classify any identified cervical lesions.\n10. Obtain cervical biopsies and, if medically indicated, performed an endocervical \ncurettage (ECC) sample collection (see below for cervical biopsy and ECC \nprocedures).\n11. Prior to removal of the speculum, inspect the lateral walls of the vagina with the \ncolposcope.  If clinically indicated, apply 5% acetic acid or Lugol\u2019s solution to the \nentire epithelium and then view by low power colposcopic magnification, noting \nacetowhite (or brownish if Lugol\u2019s solution used) vaginal lesions. Collapse the \nspeculum and rotate 90 degrees and re-open the blades to inspect the anterior and \nposterior walls of the vagina for vaginal lesions (again using the 5% acetic acid or \nLugol\u2019s solution if clinically indicated). If vaginal lesions are present, use the \nguidance given in the protocol to classify vaginal lesions and to obtain required \nbiopsies (see Sections 3.2.3.1.2 and 3.2.4.2.4) Collapse and remove the speculum.\n12. Change gloves and perform a systematic inspection of the entire external genitalia \nusing a good light source and a hand-held magnifying glass (4x to 5x power) or, \noptionally, a colposcope with low-power magnification. If external genital lesions are \npresent, use the guidance given in the protocol to classify external genital lesions and \nto obtain required biopsies (see Sections 3.2.3.1.2 and 3.2.4.2.4). \n3.2.4.2.6\nProcedures for Cervical Biopsy\nA colposcopy should precede all biopsies. Use the appropriate CRFs to note locations, \nclinical impressions, and biopsy numbers during the procedure.  Use the cervical biopsy \nkit (labels/requisition) and formalin fixative provided by the SPONSOR-designated \nCentral Laboratory.  \n1. Each discrete abnormal area that is observed on colposcopy should be biopsied.  The \nmost severe area of abnormality of a lesion observed on colposcopy should be \nbiopsied. \n2. Apply local anesthesia, if this is the local standard of care.\n3. If taking multiple biopsies, start with the most posterior (i.e. lower) lesion first. This \nwill prevent contamination of subsequent biopsy sites by the flow of blood from the \nprevious biopsy sites.\n4. Place biopsy forceps over the abnormal lesion (usually near the squamocolumnar \njunction).  \n5. Open forceps jaws to sufficient extent.\n6. Check to make sure the forceps are properly aligned (fixed end of forceps jaw \ntowards cervical os).\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n51\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n7. Rotate biopsy handles to place lesion in the center of biopsy jaw angle if necessary.\n8. Exert moderate pressure with biopsy forceps to push cervix backwards until cervix is \nfixed in position.\n9. Squeeze handles together quickly and firmly to close forceps jaws and excise lesion.\n10. Lock biopsy jaws to secure tissue (if locking mechanism available) or just hold \ntightly, then pass the forceps to the assistant.\n11. Confirm by colposcopic visualization that an appropriate and adequate biopsy was \ncollected.  The biopsy should be perpendicular to the epithelium and deep enough to \nsample the entire epithelium along with a small amount of stroma (at least 2 mm) for \nhistology.\n12. Tamponade biopsy site with cotton swab.\n13. Place the biopsy piece in the fixative container and ensure proper labeling of the \nsample as specified in the Laboratory Manual that is provided by the \nSPONSOR/Central Laboratory.  \n14. Repeat the biopsy procedure for each additional biopsy performed using a different\npair of forceps.  If multiple biopsies are obtained, each specimen must be placed in a \nseparate fixative container.  A maximum of 4 cervical biopsies should be obtained.  \nCollect all biopsy specimens prior to establishing hemostasis, if possible.\n15. Obtain complete hemostasis with directed silver nitrate stick or Monsel\u2019s (ferric \nsubsulfate) paste application.\n16. Instruct subject to:  (1) take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for uterine \ncramping (provided no allergy), (2) report significant bleeding immediately, and (3) \nrefrain from use of vaginal products, douching, tampons, and sexual intercourse for 3 \nto 7 days.\n17. On the day of collection, ship the sample at room temperature as specified in the \nLaboratory Manual that is provided by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory.\nIf no lesion is noted on colposcopy, and the subject was referred based on a cytological \nabnormality, then endocervical curettage (ECC) may be performed.  \n3.2.4.2.7\nProcedures for Endocervical Curettage (ECC)\nUse the cervical biopsy kit (labels/requisition) and formalin fixative provided by the \nSPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory.  A curet must be used (not a cytobrush) when \nobtaining the ECC specimen.  The decision to perform an ECC will be made by the study \ninvestigator according to local standards and practices.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n52\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n1. Obtain an ECC specimen either before or after endocervical biopsies (based on local\nstandard of care).\n2. Insert open basket endocervical curet into cervical os.\n3. Apply gentle pressure at the distal tip of curet against the endocervical canal and pull \nthe curet from inside to outside with pressure, while simultaneously rotating the curet \nin a circular direction.  The curet should advance no more that 20 mm up the canal \nand should be rotated completely 2 to 3 times.  Avoid sampling ectocervical lesions \nthat extend proximally into the endocervical canal, if possible.\n4. Spin the curet rapidly to trap epithelium in the basket and remove the curet from the \ncanal.  Scraped material remaining in the canal can be retrieved with small forceps.\n5. Place the ECC specimen into the fixative vial (or place the ECC specimen on paper or \nTelfa and transfer it to the fixative vial) and ensure proper labeling of the sample as \nspecified in the Laboratory Manual that is provided by the SPONSOR/Central \nLaboratory.  \n6. On the day of collection, ship the sample at room temperature as specified in the \nLaboratory Manual that is provided by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory.\n3.2.4.2.8\nProcedures for Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) and \nTop Hat Method\nLEEP used for cervical definitive therapy has contraindications for subjects with the \nfollowing conditions:  allergy to all local anesthetics; pregnancy; severe acute cervicitis \n(severe acute cervicitis should be diagnosed and treated, and excision conducted after the \ninfection has resolved); obvious invasive cancer; significant glandular neoplasia (AGUS \nfavor neoplasia, AIS, Adenocarcinoma); and microinvasive cancer.\nThe LEEP is a cervical definitive therapy method that uses a shallow pass to remove the \ncervical transformation zone.  It may be a single or multiple pass and is ~8 mm deep.  A \n\u201ctop hat\u201d cone implies a deeper wedge resection, ~15 to 25 mm deep.  It is performed by \nthe \u201ctop hat\u201d method of successively more internal and smaller loops.  \nUse the appropriate CRFs to note clinical impressions and biopsy numbers during the \nprocedure. Use the definitive therapy kit (labels/requisitions) and formalin fixative \nprovided by the SPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory.  The LEEP should be done \nunder colposcopic control.  All instruments used for the procedure must be \nnonconductive.\n1. Assist subject into dorsal lithotomy position.\n2. Place dispersive pad near operative site (thigh) and plug into electrosurgical unit \n(ESU).\n3. Place vaginal speculum and secure smoke evacuation tubing.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n53\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n4.

Initiate excision by depressing \u201ccut\u201d switch if using handpiece, cut down \n(perpendicular to tissue), across transformation zone and straight out at opposite side \nof transformation zone (depth of 8 mm) and avoid vaginal sidewall contact.\n12. Repeat cut procedure (reduced power) along endocervical canal with smaller 10 x 10 \nloop electrode if top hat conization is necessary.\n13. Hand excised tissue to assistant and dictate its orientation.  Orient the tissue by \nplacing a suture at the 12 o\u2019clock location.  Place tissue in the fixative container and \nensure proper labeling of the sample as specified in the Laboratory Manual that is \nprovided by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory.  Note:  If the top hat procedure is \nperformed, the tissue from each loop or \u201cpass\u201d should be placed in separate labeled \nfixative containers.\n14. Inspect endocervical canal opening and perform ECC, if medically indicated.  Use the \nECC label/requisition provided within the definitive therapy kit (see Section 3.2.5.6 \nfor ECC guidelines).\n15. Fulgurate base of the excision with coagulation using the ball or paddle electrode \nuntil adequate hemostasis and fulgurate 5 mm of the ectocervical margin.  If lesion \nextends beyond the excision, ablate the area and record the ablation on the \nappropriate CRF and source document.\n16. If hemostasis is inadequate, pack base of excision with Monsel\u2019s (ferric subsulfate) \npaste or in rare event suture may be required.\n17. Remove blood from posterior fornix.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n54\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n18.

Instruct subject to:  (1) take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as needed \n(provided no allergy), (2) refrain from use of vaginal products, douching, tampons, \nand sexual intercourse for 2 to 4 weeks, and (3) report significant bleeding and signs \nof infection (fever, pain) immediately.\n22. On the day of collection, ship the sample at room temperature as specified in the \nLaboratory Manual that is provided by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory.\n3.2.4.2.9\nProcedure for Laser Conization\nLaser Conization is a cervical definitive therapy procedure that uses a laser beam to \nexcise tissue, using small depressor instruments or hooks to position the cone for optimal \nexcision.  \nUse the appropriate CRFs to note clinical impressions and biopsy numbers during the \nprocedure. Use the definitive therapy kit (labels/requisitions) and formalin fixative \nprovided by the SPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory.  \n1. Assist subject into dorsal lithotomy position.\n2. Place vaginal speculum and secure smoke evacuation tubing.\n3. Set laser unit parameters (power, optical focusing of the laser beam) and test safety \nsystems.\n4. Identify cervical pathology by colposcopic examination.\n5. If appropriate, apply half-strength Lugol\u2019s solution to cervix and identify \ntransformation zone limits.\n6. Give local anesthesia if no allergy\u20144 quadrant (3, 6, 9, 12 o'clock) intracervical \ninjection of lidocaine with epinephrine.  If needed paracervical injection of the \nanesthetic may also be used.  General anesthesia may be provided if so preferred.  If \ngeneral anesthesia is preferred, intracervical injection of lidocaine with epinephrine \nmay still be used if there is no allergy to the components of the injection.\n7. Obtain pre-definitive cervical biopsies of the areas with the most severe abnormalities \n(2- to 3-mm size per location) and use the cervical biopsy labels/requisition provided \nwithin the definitive therapy kit (see 3.2.5.5 for cervical biopsy guidelines).\n8. Activate smoke evacuator.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n55\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n9.

Cut the cone by the laser beam, using small depressor instruments or hooks to \nposition the cone for optimal excision with the laser beam.\n11. Hand excised tissue to assistant and dictate its orientation.  Orient the tissue by \nplacing a suture at the 12 o\u2019clock location.  Place tissue in the fixative container and \nensure proper labeling of the sample as specified in the Laboratory Manual that is \nprovided by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory. \n12. Inspect endocervical canal opening and perform ECC, if medically indicated.  Use the \nECC label/requisition provided within the definitive therapy kit (see Section 3.2.4.2.7 \nfor ECC guidelines).\n13. Use the defocused laser beam in the wound area until adequate hemostasis, and \nvaporize 5 mm of the ectocervical margin.  If lesion extends beyond the excision, \nablate the area and record the ablation on the appropriate CRF and source document.\n14. If hemostasis is inadequate, inject more lidocaine with adrenaline or in rare event \nsuture may be required.\n15. Remove blood from posterior fornix.\n16. Remove dispersive pad and vaginal speculum and deactivate smoke evacuator.\n17. Assist subject up from table.\n18. Instruct subject to:  (1) refrain from use of vaginal products, douching/ vaginal \ncleansing, tampons, and sexual intercourse for 2 weeks, and (2) report significant \nbleeding and signs of infection (fever, pain) immediately and (3) take nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs as needed (provided no allergy)\n19. On the day of collection, ship the sample at room temperature as specified in the \nLaboratory Manual that is provided by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory.\n3.2.4.2.10\nCold-Knife Conization\nCervical cold-knife conization should be performed only when the LEEP or laser \nconization procedures are not indicated.  A cervical cold-knife conization specimen \nrepresents a conically shaped section of the cervix that will vary in size according to the \nlesion.  A broad, shallow conization would be performed for a predominantly exocervical \nlesion and a narrow, deep conization is appropriate for a predominantly endocervical \nlesion.  Pre-definitive biopsies should be obtained prior to the cervical cold-knife \nconization.  Use the appropriate CRFs to note clinical impressions and biopsy numbers \nduring the procedure.

The subject should be lying supine on the examination table. In order to prepare the \nsubject for the specimen collection with nail file, the examiner should demonstrate a \nnail file (not kept in sterile condition) prior to the procedure, and ask the subject to \nrub it on his hands. \n2. Remove the nail file from the packaging; remove the male swab from the packaging, \nthen twist the top off of the sterile saline ampule, and wet the entire head of the male\nswab with the sterile saline, but do not over moisten.  If necessary, squeeze the head \nof the swab to remove excess liquid (while maintaining sterility), as too much liquid \nmay wash cells off the skin instead of collecting them on the swab. If the swab is \ndripping saline, it is too wet.  Only one file and one swab are to be used in the penile \nsampling. \n3. In circumcised men, the examiner wearing gloves should hold the tip of the penis \nwith the thumb and index finger of the non-dominant hand.  The file should be held in \nthe dominant hand and in a tight up and down motion (or back and forth motion), \nmove the file over the left and right side of the penile shaft, encompassing the whole \nshaft, and then gently rub the glans. Sufficient pressure should be applied in order to \ncause blanching of the skin. If blanching is not observed, pressure should be \nincreased in order to collect the required DNA.  Subsequently, the examiner should\nhold the swab in the dominant hand and in a tight up and down motion, gently swab \nthe shaft and glans following the same route. As with the file, sufficient pressure \nshould be used with the male swab to blanch the skin while moving it over the area of \nloosened cellular debris. The swab should also be twisted or rotated in order to \nincrease surface area exposure for collection of cellular debris.\n4. In uncircumcised men, the examiner wearing gloves should hold the tip of the penis \nwith the thumb and index finger of the non-dominant hand.  The file should be held in \nthe dominant hand and in a tight up and down motion (or back and forth motion),\ngently move the file over the left and right side of the penile shaft, including the outer \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n57\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nforeskin.  The examiner should retract the foreskin, and hold the penis with the thumb \nand the index finger, and gently rub the file over the glans. Sufficient pressure should \nbe applied in order to cause blanching of the skin. If blanching is not observed, \npressure should be increased in order to collect the required DNA. Then follow with \na wetted swab and rub the penile shaft, the outer foreskin, and then retract the \nforeskin, and swab the glans, following the same route as the file.  As with the file, \nsufficient pressure should be used with the male swab to blanch the skin while \nmoving it over the area of loosened cellular debris.  The swab should also be twisted \nor rotated in order to increase surface area exposure for collection of cellular debris.\n5. Discard the file in a Biohazard Sharps Container. \n6. Place the swab in an STM vial and break the pre-scored handle. Do not add saline to \nthe STM vial either before or after swabbing.\n7. Securely cap the collection/transport tube containing the specimen.\n8. Place the appropriate label for the Penile Sample on the STM vial.\n3.2.4.3.2\nScrotal File and Wetted Swab for HPV PCR\n1. The subject should be lying supine on the examination table.  Remove the nail file \nfrom the packaging; remove the male swab from the packaging, then twist the top off \nof the sterile saline ampule, and wet the entire head of the male swab with the sterile \nsaline, but do not over moisten.  If necessary, squeeze the head of the swab to remove \nexcess liquid (while maintaining sterility), as too much liquid may wash cells off the \nskin instead of collecting them on the swab.  If the swab is dripping saline, it is too \nwet.  Only one file and one swab are to be used in the scrotal sampling.\n2. With the non-dominant hand, lift and move the penis off of the scrotum, and gently \nrub the file over the entire scrotum with a tight up and down motion (or back and \nforth motion), moving from left to right.  Sufficient pressure should be applied in \norder to cause blanching of the skin. If blanching is not observed, pressure should be \nincreased in order to collect the required DNA.  It is important to stretch or pull the \nskin taut in order to allow enough pressure to be applied by the nail file.  If necessary, \nthe subject can assist with this activity by holding the skin at the bottom of the \nscrotum while the file (and subsequently the wetted swab) is moved across the area.  \nThe subject should not perform the filing or swabbing procedure. \n3. Subsequently, with the non-dominant hand, lift the penis, and gently rub the wetted \nswab over the entire scrotum with a tight up and down motion, moving from left to \nright.  As with the file, sufficient pressure should be used with the male swab to\nblanch the skin while moving it over the area of loosened cellular debris.  The swab \nshould also be twisted or rotated in order to increase surface area exposure for \ncollection of debris.  Only one file and one swab are to be used in the scrotal \nsampling.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n58\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n4. Discard the file in a Biohazard Sharps container.\n5. Place the swab in an STM vial and break the pre-scored handle. Do not add saline to \nthe STM vial either before or after swabbing.\n6. Securely cap the collection/transport tube containing the specimen.\n7. Place the appropriate label for the Scrotal Sample on the STM vial.\n3.2.4.3.3\nPerineal/Perianal File and Wetted Swab for HPV PCR\n1. The subject should lie on his left lateral side with his knees tucked up towards his \nchest or in the prone knee chest position that allows comfortable access for \nexamination. Remove the nail file from the packaging.  Remove the male swab from \nthe packaging, then twist the top off of the sterile saline ampule, and wet the entire \nhead of the male swab, but do not over moisten.  If necessary, squeeze the head of the \nswab to remove excess liquid (while maintaining sterility), as too much liquid may \nwash cells off the skin instead of collecting them on the swab.  If the swab is dripping \nsaline, it is too wet.  Only one file and one swab are to be used in the perineal/perianal \nsampling. \n2. If the subject is in the left lateral position, the subject should lift their right leg, so that \nthe perineal area is able to be visualized.  Gently rub the file over the right and left \nside of the perineal and perianal area. It is important to spread the buttocks apart for \nample sampling of the perianal region. Sufficient pressure should be applied in order \nto cause blanching of the skin. If blanching is not observed, pressure should be \nincreased in order to collect the required DNA.  The examiner should gently swab the \nperineal area.  Using the non-dominant hand, the examiner should spread the buttocks\nto better visualize the perianal area and the anus.  The swab should be held in the \ndominant hand, and starting 3 to 5 cm from the anus, begin swabbing in a circular \nmotion until the entrance of the anus is reached. As with the file, sufficient pressure \nshould be used with the male swab to blanch the skin while moving it over the area of \nloosened cellular debris. The swab should also be twisted or rotated in order to \nincrease surface area exposure for collection of debris. \n3. Discard the file in a Biohazard Sharps container.\n4. Place the swab in an STM vial and break the pre-scored handle. Do not add saline to \nthe STM vial either before or after swabbing.\n5. Securely cap the collection/transport tube containing the specimen.\n6.

A second biopsy is indicated, \nif a lesion is identified in a separate region (anterior region includes penis and scrotum \nand posterior region includes perineal and perianal region) or a lesion is identified with \ndifferent morphology in the same region.  For each biopsy, different instruments are to be \nused to prevent cross-contamination between specimens.  At the investigator\u2019s discretion, \nthe lesion(s) may be surgically removed (therapeutic excision).  In that case, the entire \nspecimen must be submitted for analysis.  All specimen(s) excised should be submitted to \nthe central laboratory designated by the SPONSOR for analysis.  For the genital \nwart/lesion biopsy, the external genital lesion biopsy kit provided by the SPONSOR \ncentral laboratory is to be used.  Slides of the wart/lesion biopsy will be reviewed by a \npathologist for the purpose of management of the subject.  Management of anogenital \nwarts is a study procedure, but the decision regarding the modality of therapy will be left \nto the discretion of the investigator, per the site\u2019s standard and practices.  Excision of the \nwart/lesion is the preferred study treatment.  All excised tissue is to be submitted to the \ncentral laboratory for analysis.  If more than one biopsy is performed, then use separate \ninstruments for each biopsy.  Each biopsy should be placed in individual formalin \ncontainers.  Treatment of anogenital warts by topical medications or cryotherapy is an \nacceptable study procedure.  A biopsy of the identified lesion/lesions (e.g., morphology \ndiffers among identified lesions or more than one lesion is identified) must be obtained \nprior to administering treatment.  \nThe investigator should provide a clinical impression of the lesion, which should include \none of the following: condyloma acuminata, other HPV-related lesion (e.g., Bowenoid \npapulosis, Bowen\u2019s disease), or other non-HPV related lesions. \nThe location of all lesions that are being submitted for biopsy should be clearly identified \non the study operative report form located in the administrative binder.\nThe location and anatomical area of each biopsied wart/lesion should be identified and \nnoted (as per the lab kit requisition supplied by the SPONSOR and should also be \nrecorded on the workbook/case report form). \n1. To perform the biopsy, cleanse the biopsy area first with an antiseptic solution.\n2. Using a 25-30 gauge needle and a syringe containing 0.5 to 1 mL of 1% lidocaine or \nlidocaine with epinephrine, infiltrate below the epidermis of the wart. Optionally, a \ntopical anesthetic cream may be applied over the biopsy site prior to infiltration with \nlidocaine to decrease the pain associated with needle insertion.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n60\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3. Remove the wart tangentially with fine (iris) scissors or a scalpel blade to obtain the \nspecimen.\n4. A different set of instruments is to be used for each biopsy taken.\n5. To promote hemostasis, apply gentle pressure.  Monsel solution or 38% aluminum \nchloride may be used.  For larger areas, a single interrupted suture may be used.  \nElectrocauterization is to be avoided, but the decision is left to the discretion of the \npractitioner.  Silver nitrate is to be avoided, as it is reported to be more caustic and \npainful to the subject.\n6. Apply topical antibiotic ointment to the area to promote healing (optional). \n7. Management of anogenital warts will be left to the discretion of the investigator.  \nExcision of the wart is an acceptable study treatment.  All excised tissue is to be \nsubmitted to the central laboratory for analysis.  \n8. During genital wart treatment, follow-up biopsies should be obtained if new HPV-\nrelated lesions of differing morphology, and/or differing location appear.  A \nrecurrence is defined as the reappearance within 2 months of a lesion of similar \nmorphology in the same anatomical location after complete resolution of the initial \nlesion.  Recurring lesions will not be biopsied.  Otherwise, all new lesions will be \nbiopsied.\nThe external genital lesion biopsies will be processed and read by a central laboratory \nchosen by the SPONSOR.  These specimens will be processed at the central laboratory \nusing study-specific guidelines.  The central laboratory diagnosis will be used for \nmanagement of subjects.  However, this diagnosis will not be the diagnosis of record in \nthe study.  Rather all routine slides generated by the central laboratory will be sent to the \nPathology Panel.  The consensus diagnosis of this panel will represent the final diagnosis \nfor study purposes.  If the diagnosis of the Pathology Panel is worse than the diagnosis of \ncentral laboratory, then the investigator will be notified of the discrepancy in diagnoses.  \nExternal genital lesion specimens will also be sent to the SPONSOR for HPV analysis.  \nHPV analysis will be performed on Thinsection microtomy specimens.  Each biopsy \nspecimen will be analyzed by HPV PCR, regardless of whether an HPV-related \nhistologic diagnosis is made, for the purpose of determining the causal HPV type in the \nlesion.  \nIf a subject has an external genital lesion biopsy taken, that subject may remain in the \nstudy.\n3.2.5\nProtocol Deviations\nProtocol deviators are randomized subjects who do not meet either the inclusion or \nexclusion criteria at the start of the study and/or who do not follow the protocol correctly \nduring the study.

In addition, a subject/patient may \nbe withdrawn by the investigator or the SPONSOR if he/she violates the study plan or for \nadministrative and/or other safety reasons. The investigator or study coordinator must \nnotify the SPONSOR immediately when a subject/patient has been discontinued/ \nwithdrawn due to an adverse experience (telephone or FAX). When a subject/patient \ndiscontinues/withdraws prior to study completion, all applicable activities scheduled for \nthe final study visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation. Any adverse \nexperiences which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be \nfollowed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 3.4 SAFETY \nMEASUREMENTS - DETAILS.\nIf a subject must discontinue/withdraw after the Month 42 visit, the subject should be \nasked to return for a final \"discontinuation visit\" if it has been at least 4 months since the \nlast study visit. The visit would consist of the same specimen collection and tests \nconducted at the last study visit and the subject would be formally discontinued from the \nstudy at the end of this visit. The discontinuation visit should not be done if it is \nmedically contraindicated or if the subject refuses. If no discontinuation visit is \nperformed, the subject should be formally discontinued from the study on the day the \ndecision to discontinue is made.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n62\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nAll attempts should be made to contact a subject who is lost to follow-up (a certified \nletter must be sent at the final attempt). Subjects who are lost to follow-up should be \nformally discontinued from the study on the day of the last unsuccessful attempt at \ncontact. \n3.2.7\nSubject Relocation\nGiven the duration of the study and the age of the study population, it can be expected \nthat subjects may relocate during the study.  The SPONSOR must be contacted for each \ntemporary and permanent relocation as soon as the situation is known.  Every effort \nshould be made to adjust study visits around a subject\u2019s temporary absence (e.g., college \nbreaks, summer vacation) so that the visits will be within the visit windows. Every effort \nshould be made to have a relocated subject seen at another site participating in this study \nin order to keep the visits within the visit windows and to allow the subject to complete \nthe study.\n3.3\nEFFICACY/IMMUNOGENICITY MEASUREMENTS\n3.3.1\nImmunogenicity Measurements\nThe 9-valent HPV competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) and 9-valent HPV total \nIgG Luminex Immunoassay are the primary assays used for the primary objective of the \nstudy. Additional testing may be conducted on a subset of subjects using another HPV \nimmunological assay (Pseudovirion-based Neutralization Assay, or PBNA) for \nsupportive exploratory analyses.\n3.3.1.1 Competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA) - Anti-HPV Levels in Serum\nThe purpose of the 9-valent HPV cLIA is to detect antibodies to HPV VLPs types 6, 11, \n16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, before and after vaccination with the 9-valent HPV L1 \nVLP vaccine.  This is the primary assay used by the SPONSOR/Central Laboratory to\nevaluate the serological response to the vaccine, to measure HPV infection induced \nantibody, and to exclude subjects with evidence of a current or past HPV infection from \nthe primary analysis.  \nYeast-derived VLPs are coupled to a set of 9 distinct fluorescent Luminex microspheres.  \nAntibody titers are determined in a competitive format in which known, HPV type-\nspecific phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) compete \nwith the subject\u2019s serum antibodies for binding to type-specific conformationally \nsensitive, neutralizing epitopes on the VLPs.  The fluorescent signals from the bound \nHPV-specific detection mAbs are inversely proportional to the subject\u2019s antibody levels \nto the neutralizing epitopes on the VLPs.  Results for the assay are reported as a \nconcentration of antibody in arbitrary milli-Merck Units per milliliter (mMU/mL). \nThe HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 cLIA is performed in a 96-well microtiter \nplate.  A 12-point standard curve using reference serum from 9-valent HPV vaccine \nimmunized Rhesus macaque monkeys, 4 controls, and 16 samples are added to the plate \nin duplicate.  Samples are initially tested at dilutions of 1:4 and 1:40.  The detection \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n63\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nantibodies followed by the VLP-microspheres for types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and \n58 are added to each well.  The plates are sealed with foil covers and incubated for 15 to \n25 hours.  Following incubation, the plates are washed and then analyzed on a BioPlex \n(Luminex) instrument.\nThe high, medium, low, and negative controls used for this assay were collected from \nhumans that were either HPV sero-negative, had low antibody titers from natural \ninfection, or had medium to high antibody titers to HPV following vaccination. \nThe seropositivity cutoffs for HPV types are assessed using a panel of sera from subjects \nthat are highly likely to be HPV na\u00efve (children), and from subjects who are likely to be \nseropositive. Any sample with a cLIA titer lower than the cutoffs is considered serostatus \nnegative. Serology cutoffs for the HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 cLIA will be \ndetermined. A memorandum with the serology cutoff values for each vaccine HPV type \nwill be added to the study file before unblinding the study database.\n3.3.1.2 Total IgG Luminex Immunoassay - Anti-HPV Levels in Serum\nThe purpose of the 9-valent HPV total IgG Luminex immunoassay (9-valent HPV IgG \nassay) is to measure antibody concentrations (titers) to HPV VLP 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, \n45, 52 and 58, determined in a multiplexed, direct binding format by measuring the \namount of VLP-specific IgG bound to VLP-microspheres on the Luminex platform. \nYeast-derived VLPs are coupled to a set of 9 distinct fluorescent Luminex microspheres.  \nFollowing incubation with human serum, fluorescent signal from an anti-human IgG \ndetection antibody that binds directly to serum IgG and equally to each IgG subclass (1-\n4) is directly proportional to the individual\u2019s HPV type-specific anti-VLP IgG antibody \nlevels.  \nA standard reference serum from Rhesus macaques that received 9-valent HPV vaccine is \nused to generate a 12 point standard curve starting at a 1:100 serum dilution followed by \nsubsequent 3-fold dilutions, and to quantitate the levels of VLP-specific IgG antibodies.  \nTiters to HPV16 are calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) serum standard \nfor HPV16, and reported in International Units/milliliter (IU/mL).  Titers to HPV 6, 11, \n18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 are cross-standardized to HPV16 and are reported in Antibody \nUnits/milliliter (AbU/mL). The correlation of median fluorescent intensity (MFI) units to \nIU/mL or AbU/mL of VLP-specific IgG is made by interpolating the MFI data through a \n4-parameter curve fitting algorithm.  \nThe 9-valent HPV IgG assay is performed in a 96-well microtiter, filter plate.  A 12-point \nstandard reference serum, 4 controls and 32 samples are added to the plate in duplicate.  \nSamples are tested after dilution in assay diluent consisting of phosphate buffered saline \nand 1% Triton X.  To each well is added the VLP-microspheres for types 6, 11, 16, 18, \n31, 33, 45, 52 and 58.   The plates are covered with foil and incubated for 15 min. to 1 \nhour.  The filter plates are washed and resuspended in buffer containing mouse anti-\nhuman IgG monoclonal antibody conjugated to phycoerytherin (PE). The plates are \ncovered with foil and incubated for an additional 15 min. to 1 hour.  Following the \nsecond incubation period, the plates are washed once and then analyzed on a BioPlex \n(Luminex) instrument.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n64\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3.3.1.3 Pseudovirion-based Neutralization Assay (PBNA)\nThe purpose of the HPV 16 and HPV 18 PBNA are to detect the presence of antibodies \ncapable of inhibiting cellular uptake of HPV pseudovirions for HPV types 16 and 18 in \nserum after vaccination with the 9-valent HPV vaccine.  This is assay is developed and \nexecuted by Deutsche Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) laboratories, Heidelberg, \nGermany, on behalf of Merck Research Laboratories (MRL) to evaluate neutralizing \nantibody response to the HPV 16 and 18 components of the vaccines.\nHPV 16 and 18 pseudovirions are produced at DKFZ laboratories by co-transfecting the \n293TT human embryonic kidney cell line with an expression plasmid encoding the HPV \nL1 and L2 capsid genes and another encoding luciferase from the marine copepod \nGaussia princeps. Pseudovirions of L1/L2 self-assemble and package the luciferase \nreporter plasmid within.  Pseudovirions are incubated with HeLaT K4 cells and, when \npseudovirions are able to enter cells, Gaussia luciferase is expressed and secreted to the \ncell culture supernatant.  If neutralizing antibodies are present in the test sera, infection of \ncells by pseudovirions and subsequent expression of luciferase reporter is inhibited.  The \naddition of luciferase substrate, coelenterazine, to the reaction results in luminescence \nwhen luciferase is present in the cell culture supernatant.  This luminescence is measured \nin a plate reader.      \nThe PBNA assay is performed in a 384-well format in clear, flat-bottom culture plates.  \nSera and controls are initially diluted 1:2.5 in neutralization cell culture medium and \nserially diluted 4-fold in a master plate from which nine identical assay plates are \naliquoted to allow for triplicate measurements of neutralization for each: HPV16, HPV18 \nand BPV (bovine papillomavirus) pseudovirions.  BPV PBNA assays are run as a control \nto verify that the test serum is not toxic to the cells, which can mimic neutralization.  Pre-\nprepared serum assay plates are thawed and diluted pseudovirions are added, 15\u00b5l/well, \nsuch that the final dilutions of pseudovirions in each assay after addition of cells are: \n1:20,000 for HPV16, 1:40,000 for HPV18 and 1:80,000 for BPV.  Plates are incubated at \nroom temperature for 1 hour.  Human HeLaT K4 cells, 20 \u00b5l/well, are seeded onto the \nplates in neutralization cell culture medium at a density of 1500 cells/well and incubated \nat 37 oC and 5% CO2 for 2 days.  The triplicate HPV16, HPV18 and BPV PBNA assay \nplates are equilibrated to room temperature before addition of 1:100 diluted \ncoelenterazine substrate buffer to each well of each plate, 20 \u00b5l/well, using FlexDrop \nautomation, which synchronizes substrate addition to allow equal incubation times of all \n9 plates in a batch.  Luminescence is read by an Envision 2101 plate reader and data are \nstored as a text file.  Serum neutralization titers are calculated by linear interpolation and \ndefined as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that caused 50% reduction in luciferase \nreporter activity (EC50) when compared to control wells (pseudovirions in the absence of \nserum and pseudovirions in the presence of a standard serum derived from HPV vaccine \nrecipient).  \nThis assay is currently designated to offer a secondary measurement, complementary to \nthe 9-valent HPV cLIA and 9-valent HPV IgG assay.\n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n65\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3.3.2\nPCR Assays - Detection of HPV in Swabs and Tissue Specimens\nGynecological and genitourinary swabs and all Thinsection microtomy biopsy specimens \nwill be tested for detection of HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, \nand 59.  In addition to this testing, gynecological and genitourinary swabs and \nThinsection microtomy biopsy specimens may tested for other HPV types.\nHPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 will be analyzed by type-specific \nmultiplex (L1, E6, E7 gene detection) PCR assay (described in Section 3.3.2.1).   HPV \ntypes other than 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 will be analyzed by the duplex (E6, \nE7 gene detection) PCR assay (using the preparation method described in Section 3.3.2.1).   \n3.3.2.1 Multiplex PCR Assays\nThe following procedures will be done for the detection of HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, \n33, 45, 52, and 58 in frozen swabs and Thinsection microtomy biopsy samples.  \nSpecimens are received and then prepared for multiplex PCR using a DNA purification \nmethod (Qiagen Technology Kit).  Multiplex PCR (based on real-time fluorescent PCR) \nallows the simultaneous detection of 3 gene products (L1, E6, and E7) for a given HPV \ntype in 1 reaction.  The HPV type-specific primer pairs based on the published HPV L1, \nE6, and E7 sequences, are used to specifically amplify a portion of each gene \nsimultaneously.  The specific amplicons are detected in real-time by fluorescently-labeled \noligonucleotide probes.  The gene-specific oligonucleotide probes are each labeled with a \ndifferent fluorescent label, and the fluorescent emission is captured during PCR cycling.  \nAfter analysis of the raw fluorescent data by the real time PCR instrument software, a \nthreshold cycle (Ct), which represents the PCR cycle at which an increase in reporter \nfluorescence above a baseline signal can first be detected, is determined.  Each gene-\nspecific assay (i.e., gene-specific dye layer) is considered positive if the Ct is <45 cycles. \nA gene-specific assay is considered negative if the Ct = \"No Ct\".  A sample is called \npositive when 2 or 3 genes are positive or when the same single gene scores positive on \nconsecutive tests.\n3.3.2.2 Preparation and Disposition of Thinsections of Biopsy Tissue\nThe following procedures will be performed at the SPONSOR-designated Central \nLaboratory.  The procedures will be performed by an experienced, qualified \nhistotechnologist according to the Central Laboratory's Standard Operating Procedure \n(SOP).  The histotechnologist will assure that the microtome and work areas are clean \nand free of contaminants.  All Thinsection microtomy for PCR will be performed at a \ntime when all other routine work has been completed, so that potential contaminations \ncan be minimized.  Prior to sectioning each block, a new blade will be installed in the \nmicrotome.  The blade will only be positioned so that it is at the left margin of the blade \nsurface.  Technicians sectioning study blocks will utilize \u201cbiologically clean\u201d gloves \nwhile handling the blocks (new gloves for each block).  First, the histotechnologist will \nface the block by removing two 4-micron sections from the face of the block.  These \nsections will be discarded.

The pair of sterile \nplastic forceps used is then discarded after placing the cut section in each tube.  Each tube\nis then placed inside a plastic sleeve and sealed. \nTwo additional, consecutive 4-micron sections will then be cut and the 2 sections floated \nin the water bath for preparation of the second H&E slide both sections to be placed on \none slide (Slide 2 with 2 sections each).  All H&E slides (Slides 1 and 2) will have a \nhistopathologic review by the central laboratory's pathologist.\nSlides and tubes should be labeled with subject's allocation number.  The specimen tubes \nare collated with the appropriate specimen requisition and prepared for shipping to the \nSPONSOR-designated Central Laboratory and then in turn, shipped on to MRL.  \nThe microtome is cleaned in preparation for the next block and the process above is \nrepeated.  The microtome blade is replaced with a new blade and adjusted for each new \nbiopsy block and the same procedure is to be followed.  A new pair of clean gloves and a \nnew pair of clean, disposable forceps will be used for each block being sectioned.  The \n\u201cused\u201d blade may be retained for cutting non-PCR blocks.  The total number of sections \nto be cut from each block is 13.  A total of 2 slides and 9 tubes:\n1. Slide 1 (H&E), with 2 sections each, stained.\n2.

Such cases will be summarized separately in a \nmanner similar to breakthrough cases, with all relevant factors such as baseline \ndemographics and immunogenicity profiles over time characterized; however, these cases \nwill not be included in the primary summary of effectiveness endpoints.\nAt the time of the interim analysis (Month 72), summaries of the incidence of HPV 6, 11, \n16, 18-related persistent infection for a duration of \u22656 months (within \u00b1 1 month \nwindows) and cervical, vulvar, vaginal, perineal, perianal, and penile intraepithelial \npreinvasive and invasive disease, and external genital lesions will be provided, separately \nfor males and females. Similar summaries of the incidence rates of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, \n33, 45, 52, and 58-related persistent infection for a duration of \u22656 months (within \u00b1 1 \nmonth windows) and disease will be provided to include follow-up data through Month \n96 and Month 126.  \nThe confidence intervals around the point estimate of the incidence rates per 100 person-\nyears are exact Poisson distribution-based nominal 95% confidence intervals. \nSummaries will be provided by gender. At each analysis time point, the cumulative \nincidence rate for effectiveness endpoints will be computed, along with the associated \n95% confidence interval. In addition, exploratory analyses will be conducted to \ncharacterize subjects who become cases of persistent infection or disease endpoints in the \nlong-term effectiveness follow-up period.  Baseline demographic characteristics, pre-\nvaccination anti-HPV serology status, and post-vaccination immunogenicity profiles will \nbe considered.  Time-to-event plots will also be provided by gender if >5 cases are \nobserved in the respective group(s).  \nAny comparisons of the incidence rates of effectiveness endpoints between Protocol \nV503-002 and Protocol V503-001 will be descriptive and no formal statistical \ncomparisons will be made. Merck is undertaking other studies to evaluate the long-term \neffectiveness of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine.  \nIncidence rates of the same endpoints described above will be summarized for additional \nHPV types for which PCR testing is planned in this study (35, 39, 51, 56, and 59).  These \ndata, when available, will provide information related to incidence of non-vaccine type \nHPV in this population and potential cross-protection against these additional HPV types.\nAn additional analysis of persistent infection for a duration of 12 months (within \u00b1 1 \nmonth windows) or more will be conducted.  \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n79\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\n3.5.5.4 Summaries of Baseline Characteristics, Demographics, and Other Analyses\nBaseline characteristics and demographic variables have already been summarized in the \nbase study. Additional summaries in this extension study are planned as below. Baseline \ncharacteristics and demographic variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics \nor categorical tables.  No statistical hypothesis tests will be performed on these \ncharacteristics.  \nSubject Accounting\nReasons for subjects excluded from the PPI population and the PPE population will be \nsummarized and displayed in subject accounting tables. \nSubject Characteristics\nAt interim analyses and end of study we will also report the percentage of subjects who \nare 16 years of age or above. Pap test results, STIs and sexual history will also be \nsummarized.\n3.5.6\nMultiplicity\nSince there is no hypothesis test for the Protocol 002-20 extension, multiplicity \nconsiderations are not relevant.\n3.5.7\nSample Size and Power Calculations\nThe sample size for this long-term follow-up study is fixed by the number of Protocol \n002 study participants who are eligible and willing to participate in the extension.  There \nis no formal hypothesis that will be tested this long-term follow-up study.  Approximately \n2600 subjects 9 to 15 years of age were enrolled in Protocol V503-002.  At the end of the \nbase study, approximately 97% of the boys and girls had completed the study.\n3.5.8\nSubgroup Analyses and Effect of Baseline Factors\nImmunogenicity summaries will be available by age groups and by gender.\n3.5.9\nInterim Analyses\nInterim analyses will be conducted at Month 72 and Month 96 to assess the feasibility of \nobtaining 10 full years of follow-up.  The decision to continue with the effectiveness \ncomponent of the study will depend on the ability to collect sufficient effectiveness data \nthrough Months 72 and 96, and anticipated through the remainder of the study.  At the \nfirst interim analysis, the percent of subjects (relative to the total number of subjects who \nreceived 3 injections of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine) who received 3 injections of 9-\nvalent HPV L1 VLP vaccine, reached age 16, and had no further follow-up with \neffectiveness data after reaching age 16 will be estimated. If this proportion is greater \nthan or equal to 80%, the effectiveness component of the study will be terminated from \nMonth 78 onwards. Under this scenario, subjects will continue to be evaluated for \n07W32C\nProduct:  V503\n80\nProtocol/Amendment No.: 002-20\nV503_002-20_ASSEM_PROT_Full_Prot   APPROVED\n06-Sep-2012\nU.S. IND, U.S. Study\nRestricted \nConfidential \u2013 Limited Access\nimmunogenicity and safety. At the second interim analysis, this percentage up to and \nincluding data to Month 96 will be estimated. If it is greater than or equal to 80%, the \neffectiveness component of the study will be terminated from Month 102 and onwards. \nAfter each interim analysis, summaries of the incidence of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, \n52, and 58-related persistent infection and cervical, vulvar, vaginal, perineal, perianal, \nand penile intraepithelial preinvasive and invasive disease, and external genital lesions \nwill be provided, separately for males and females.\n3.5.10 Compliance (Medication Adherence)\nV503-002-20 participants will not receive injections of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine \nduring the long term follow-up study. Therefore, measurement of compliance to vaccine \ndosing regimen does not apply to the long term follow-up study.\n3.6\nDATA MANAGEMENT\nInformation regarding Data Management procedures for this protocol will be provided by \nthe SPONSOR.\n3.7\nBIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS\nThe laboratory that is analyzing any clinical samples should be blinded to the subject\u2019s \nvaccination group.\nIt is the responsibility of the primary investigator to ensure that all staff personnel who \nwill be handling, packaging, and/or shipping clinical specimens act in conformance with \nInternational Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations relating to the handling and \nshipping of hazardous goods.\nAll specimens will be labeled with preprinted computer-generated labels provided by the \nSPONSOR and/or by the SPONSOR\u2019s Central Laboratory.
