                "Content": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) has been noted to be a common disorder in adult men.  According to one estimate, it affects 17% of men in the United States (US) (more than 16 million men, age range 20-79 years).(1) Note: Reference to the IB wasremoved in amendment 4. According to the Men\u2019s Attitudes to Life Events and Sexuality (MALES) study, ED affects 16% of men in Europe, North America, and South America, with rates varying markedly from one country to another.(2-5)  The incidence of ED increases with increasing age.  Co-morbidities that contribute to ED include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression.(2)  Other factors associated with an increased risk of ED include smoking and high dietary intake of cholesterol and unsaturated fats.(6)Currently, several phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are available for the treatment of ED. Note: The sentence was modified in amendment 4.The number of men seeking medical consultation for the condition is highly variable.(1,6) In the US population, it is estimated that approximately 27% of men with ED will take a PDE5 inhibitor.(7) Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is a form of acute optic neuropathy that affects an estimated 5700 patients a year in the US(8), generally over age 50.  It affects men and women equally, with onset of clinical manifestations occurring on average at 60 years of age. Clinical manifestations include acuteunilateral loss of visual field with acuity variably affected associated with a swollen optic nerve.(9,10)  Risk factors for NAION include small cup to disc ratio of the optic nerve head, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking.(11)The diagnosis of NAION involves differentiation from arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy from temporal arteritis or other forms of arteritis, demylinating optic neuritis, or other inflammatory optic neuropathies, eg, sarcoid or syphilis, compressive or infiltrative optic neuropathy, and post-papilledema optic atrophy on the basis of setting, clinical course, physical examination findings, and laboratory test results.  Sometimes NAION must be distinguished from branch or central retinal BAY 38-9456 / 12912 / Integrated Protocol Version 4.0 (02 March 2016)\nPage 7 of 59\nartery occlusion if the patient is seen late after the visual loss.  There is no specific \nlaboratory test definitive for NAION.\nThe epidemiology of NAION is not well described in the literature.  By one \nestimate, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of NAION is 10.2 cases per \n100,000 patients per year in people aged 50 and older.(8)  Another, earlier study that \nused surveys of referring physicians, estimated the mean annual incidence as \n2.30 cases per 100,000 population for subjects aged 50 and older.(12)\nSeveral case reports have been published in the last few years on a potential \nassociation between the use of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil, used for the treatment \nof ED, and the development of NAION.(13-16)  Similar reports have also been \npublished for tadalafil, another PDE5 inhibitor.(11,17-19)  Subsequently, a pooled \nanalysis of data on sildenafil, collected from 103 clinical trials involving more than \n13,000 men and observational studies generating more than 35,000 person-years \nfound an estimated incidence rate of 2.8 cases of NAION per 100,000 person-years \nof sildenafil use.(20) This rate in men using PDE5 inhibitors was deemed to be \nsimilar to that expected in the general US population, where estimates range from \n2.5 to 11.8 per 100,000 men over the age of 50.  Most recently, a small case-control \nstudy of 38 cases of NAION and 38 matched controls determined an odds ratio (OR)\nof NAION associated with sildenafil or tadalafil of 1.81 (95% confidence interval \n[CI]: 0.51 - 6.37).  However, the OR was 10.7 (95% CI: 1.3 \u2013 95.8) among subjects \nwith a history of myocardial infarction and 6.9 (95% CI: 0.8 \u2013 63.6) among those \nwith a history of hypertension.(21)\nAs a result of these reports, precautionary statements have been added to the product \nlabeling of all PDE5 inhibitors.(22-24) (See Appendix 10.2).  Individuals with a \nhistory of NAION are advised not to use these products, and those individuals who \nare using a PDE5 inhibitor and experience the loss of vision are advised to stop their \nmedication and see their physician.\nTo further address this matter, Bayer sponsored a pilot study by 3 independent \nmedical experts to explore the feasibility of conducting a retrospective epidemiology\nBAY 38-9456 / 12912 / Integrated Protocol Version 4.0 (02 March 2016)\nPage 8 of 59\nstudy by using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) in the United \nKingdom to provide a more recent incidence rate estimate of NAION.\nA case validation algorithm for establishing a diagnosis of NAION was used by \nindependent medical experts. The GPRD pilot study found an incidence rate of\n6.9 cases of NAION per 100,000 person-years for men and 4.8 cases per \n100,000 person-years for women.  However, the data available were significantly \ndeficient for diagnosis of NAION.  Contributing to the difficulties identified in the \npilot study is the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis of NAION retrospectively, \neven by medical experts.\nOther methodological difficulties in performing an epidemiologic study include a \nmultitude of confounding factors, the as-needed (PRN) use of PDE5 inhibitors, \npotential selection bias, and the large sample size required.  Thus, the results of \nalmost any epidemiology database study would be difficult to interpret.\nBecause the study herein described is to provide information on a possible \nassociation between a rare medical condition (NAION) and a relatively uncommon \ndrug exposure (PDE5 inhibitors), a prospective field study has been chosen.  A \nprospective approach will optimize the potential to assess timing of exposure to \nPDE5 inhibitors and provide a more reliable means of diagnosing NAION.  \nDifferent study designs, in particular a case-crossover design and a case-control \ndesign, were assessed.  The following difficulties with a prospective case-control \ndesign are described below:\n\uf0b7\nSelection bias:  Subjects without the outcome of interest would be asked to give \nconsent to participate in a study involving questionnaires dealing with ED and \nPDE5 inhibitor use.  It is not clear that subjects who self-select for participation \nas controls in such a study would be comparable to the cases.  It is also not clear \nwhether a sufficient number of control subjects could be identified.\n\uf0b7\nConfounding:  Though controls could be matched to cases with respect to ED, \nand multiple control subjects could be matched to the cases, the prospective \nBAY 38-9456 / 12912 / Integrated Protocol Version 4.0 (02 March 2016)\nPage 9 of 59\ncase-control design does not permit matching on the wide range of covariates \n(risk factors) that may be associated with NAION.  Imbalances between cases \nand controls could be addressed only in the analysis by logistic regression, \nwhich, in the case of major imbalances, cannot reliably protect against \nconfounding.\n\uf0b7\nDiagnostic bias:  It is possible that the likelihood of a diagnosis of NAION may \nitself depend upon exposure history, given the knowledge of reports suggesting a \npossible association between NAION and the use of PDE5 inhibitors became \nwide-spread among health care providers and consumers in 2005.\nThe following difficulties with a prospective case-crossover design are described \nbelow:\n\uf0b7\nRecall bias:  Subjects are asked to recall the exposure just prior to onset of the \nevent as well as exposure at some earlier time. Of necessity, the time period for \nwhich the subject is questioned about earlier exposure is more remote from the \nevent, and the subject\u2019s ability to recall and accurately report the details of \nexposure for the more remote time period is less reliable than his ability to report \na recent exposure, especially an exposure just prior to the onset of symptoms of \nchanges in vision.\n\uf0b7\nDiagnostic bias:  Subjects experiencing symptoms may be more likely to seek \nmedical care and to receive a diagnosis of NAION if the symptoms develop \nshortly after the use of a PDE5 inhibitor.\nThe case-crossover design provides some advantages over a case-control design.  \nSince it would be difficult to find a comparable control population balanced with the \nNAION population with respect to multiple confounding factors, a case-crossover \ndesign is preferable.  In a case-crossover study, each case serves as its own control.  \nA relative strength of this design is that it controls for known and unknown \ncovariates (provided that these do not change with time), reducing the likelihood of \nconfounding on this basis.  The problem of recall bias and diagnostic bias remain.\nBAY 38-9456 / 12912 / Integrated Protocol Version 4.0 (02 March 2016)Page 10 of 59The case-crossover design examines PDE5 inhibitor exposure at the time of NAION onset compared with prior time points for the same subject. The study design calls for a narrow exposure window that is consistent for each subject and each assessment period. This is in contrast to a case-control design, in which the lack of a narrow exposure window could result in enhancement of the effects of other underlying, confounding disease states.Based on this assessment, a case-crossover design was chosen for this study.The case-crossover study to be conducted under this protocol will examine only subjects with a NAION event. A 3-person, blinded expert panel will confirm the diagnosis of NAION.  To enhance the capacity of the study to detect a safety signal between NAION and the use of PDE5 inhibitors, it will focus on a narrow exposure window (a 2-day time frame for NAION onset) that will prevent dilution of the time span from ingestion of PDE5 inhibitor to the onset of NAION and it will include control periods in the proceeding months.(25)",

The correlation coefficient was calculated based on the PDE5 inhibitor drug prevalence in the risk-and control period.(32) Although the calculation supported the view of independence, it was recommended to use tentatively \uf066=0.2.Summarizing, the study is designed to test the superiority hypothesis that ED subjects exposed to any PDE5 inhibitor will have an increased risk (\uf06c) of suffering from NAION. Thus the null hypothesis is:H0 : \uf06c= 1The alternative hypothesis is:H1 : \uf06c> 1The alternative hypothesis will be accepted if the 1-sided lower 95% confidence interval of the estimated HR does not include 1.Assuming an accuracy of 90% for the NAION diagnosis that includes definite and probable cases, the number of potential NAION cases with ED to be included in this study is increased from 258 to 284.

This shall not be in conflict with fulfilment of \nreporting requirements to all concerned authorities, boards and committees.  \nBayer HealthCare will follow a very conservative strategy of reporting to ensure \nmaximum possible transparency in terms of safety-relevant information.\nEvents/case reports will be processed as follows:\nSuspected NAION Prior to the Signing of the Informed Consent\nEnrolment of an individual into the study is linked to three main conditions:  male \nperson, prior intake of PDE5 inhibitor and the suspicion of NAION.  Note: This text \nwas modified as described in amendment 4. Consequently, every subject enrolled in \nthis study will have had suspicion of NAION and will have taken at least 1 dose of \nPDE5 inhibitor prior to suspicion of NAION (although the PDE5 inhibitor may have \nbeen taken as much as 1 year before the suspicion of NAION).  These adverse \nevents will therefore be processed as solicited post-marketing adverse events.  As \nBayer HealthCare is actively looking for such case reports they are considered \n\u2018solicited\u2019 and will be assessed as \u2018serious\u2019 and associated to the PDE5 inhibitor (as \nnoted above) to allow for distribution for expedited reporting.  They will be reported \nexpeditedly to all parties involved (please refer to Section 7.4.1).  This includes \nscreen failures with NAION and/or the suspicion of NAION with a history of PDE5 \ninhibitor use.\nIf there is follow-up information on the course of NAION at any time after \nenrolment this will trigger a follow-up report of the \u2018solicited\u2019 post-marketing \nadverse event report.  From a medical and procedural point of view it is reasonable \nnot to consider this a new serious adverse event (SAE) or suspected unexpected \nserious adverse reaction (SUSAR), as no new exposure to a PDE5 inhibitor took \nplace.  This does not refer to a worsening of NAION which is considered a new \nSAE and should be reported according to the procedures in Section 7.4.2.  The \ncondition of \u201cworsening\u201d is based on the investigator\u2019s clinical judgment.\n",
