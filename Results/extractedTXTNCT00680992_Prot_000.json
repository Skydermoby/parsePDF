In all other cases, \ndenosumab treatment continues until confirmation of disease progression, investigator\u2019s \nrecommendation of discontinuation, Amgen\u2019s recommendation of discontinuation, the subject\u2019s \ndecision to discontinue for any reason, or administration of any of the proscribed therapies. \nDuring the time the study is still open, re-treatment may be allowed for subjects who \ndemonstrated a response to denosumab and are currently not receiving denosumab treatment \n(eg, in the case of recurrent disease while subject is in the safety follow up phase or subjects that \nhave completed the study and have later experienced disease progression).  The re-treatment \ndecision including the use of the loading dose and discontinuation of therapy will be handled on a \ncase-by-case basis; prior authorization from Amgen is required.  Subjects must meet all \ninclusion/exclusion criteria prior to being considered for re-treatment. \nTo evaluate the long-term safety profile of denosumab, data (treatment plus follow-up) will be \ncollected for all subjects enrolled through November 2012 for a minimum of 60 months, or until \ndeath or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first (Section 3.4.2).  For subjects enrolled after \nNovember 2012 (PK substudy), data (treatment plus follow-up) will be collected until the end of \nthe clinical study (Section 3.4.2).  \nSubjects who discontinue(d) investigational product will have an End of Treatment visit \napproximately 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.  Thereafter, they will \ncomplete safety follow-up visits approximately every 6 months (\u00b1 1 month) for the first year and \nevery 12 months (\u00b1 1 month) thereafter until the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2).  During \nthe safety follow-up phase, subjects will be asked about serious adverse events, adverse \nevents of interest, and disease treatments and outcomes (Section 9.2). \nPrior to Amendment 7 IRB/IEC approval, subjects currently in the safety follow-up in study \n20040215 will continue on the safety follow-up in this study for up to 2 years after their end of \nstudy visit on study 20040215.  The total length of safety follow-up on this study for patients \nenrolling from the safety follow-up phase of Amgen study 20040215 will be 2 years less the time \nspent in safety follow-up on study 20040215.  Upon the approval of Amendment 7, subjects who \nenrolled in 20062004 from the 20040215 study will also follow the 20062004 schedule, and \ncomplete the assessments as described in Appendix A. \nApproximately 50 sites will participate. \nPrimary and Secondary Endpoints:   \nSafety profile of denosumab characterized in terms of the type, frequency, and severity of \nadverse events and laboratory abnormalities for each cohort.  \nPrimary study endpoints: \nSecondary study endpoints\n\u2022 \ntime to disease progression for cohort 1 \n: \n\u2022 \nproportion of subjects without any surgery at month 6 for cohort 2 \n\u2022 \nserum denosumab (trough) concentrations (PK subset) \nSample Size:   \nThe number of subjects in this study is determined by the number of GCTB subjects who qualify \nfor the study.  It is anticipated that approximately 530 subjects will participate.  Prior to \nAmendment 7, 510 subjects were enrolled.

Each vial \ncontains a sterile, clear, colorless to slightly yellow, practically free from particles, preservative \nfree liquid in open label glass.  Denosumab will be administered as a SC injection.  \nAll subjects should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (at least \n500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D), except in the case of pre-existing hypercalcemia. \nControl Group:   \nNone \nProcedures:   \nStudy procedures will only be performed after written independent ethics committee / institutional \nreview board (IEC/IRB) approved informed consent is obtained from each subject.   \nThe site will complete an Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Worksheet for each subject to be enrolled to \nthis study.  Once this worksheet is submitted to Amgen and signed as approved, the site will \nreceive a written enrollment confirmation from Amgen allowing the specific subject to enroll in the \nstudy.  The approval process is required for new enrolling subjects and subjects considered for \nretreatment.  Subjects enrolling from Amgen study 20040215 must complete the \nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria Worksheet, but do not need to complete the approval process.  The \nsite must receive the signed enrollment confirmation form back from Amgen before dosing may \nbegin.  \nThe following procedures will be performed at screening for all subjects (except 20040215 safety \nfollow-up subjects) enrolled to the study: medical history; Karnofsky performance status; physical \nexam; disease status; pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential; serum collection for \nanti-denosumab antibody assay (baseline); patient reported outcomes (baseline).  Local \nlaboratory values, adverse events, concomitant medications, and treatment procedures will be \ncollected.  Subjects enrolled to the PK substudy will also have serum and urine collection for PK \nand biomarker assessments.  A copy of the standard of care imaging reports obtained within \n1 year before enrollment, demonstrating active GCTB must be attached to the subject\u2019s \nmedical record.  Histopathology reports dated within 1 year before enrollment will also be \ncollected.  Subjects from the 20040215 study will not be required to submit screening imaging \nand histopathology reports upon enrollment into this study.  Similar data from procedures \nperformed as standard of care will be attached to the subject\u2019s medical record.  Select \nhistorical and select on-study imaging performed as standard of care will be required to be sent to \na central imaging vendor for evaluation of disease response. \nStatistical Considerations:   \nThe sample size for this study is determined by the number of subjects who qualify for the study.  \nIt is anticipated that approximately 530 subjects will participate. \nThe first and second interim analyses were conducted after 50 and 100 subjects, respectively, \nhad the opportunity to complete 6 months of treatment.

 Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 15 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n \n \n(Szendroi et al, 2003; Szendroi, 2004).  Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) develops after \nthe epiphyseal plates have closed and is most commonly diagnosed during the third \ndecade of life.  However, cases occur rarely in skeletally mature adolescents (ie, \nadolescents who have closed epiphyseal plates). \nSymptoms that accompany primary GCTB include localized pain, tenderness, and \nswelling and the osteolysis may lead to pathologic fractures, decreased joint motion and \nimpaired function.  Lesions that originate in the spine may also result in neurological \ndeficits.  \nSurgery is the definitive therapy for GCTB and about 80% of primary GCTB patients \nhave lesions amenable to surgical resection.  Although en bloc excisions of the tumor \nmay be curative, they also carry significant morbidity (eg, amputation of a limb, joint \nresection) and greatly influence quality of life.  Curettage procedures with and without \nbone graft may allow for complete resection of the tumor and preservation of the limb or \njoint, but the risk for recurrence is greater.  Larger GCTB lesions may not be amenable \nto curettage resections and may result in severe morbid procedures.  In addition, lesions \nin bones of the hand and distal radius have the highest rate of metastasis even with \nen bloc excision.  Overall, the risk for recurrence is estimated at 10 to 20 percent after \nen bloc excision and at 40% to 75% (Malawer et al, 2005) after curettage, albeit a less \ndebilitating procedure. \nThe GCTB lesion has a wide transition zone and poorly defined borders.  In order to \ndecrease the risk for recurrence with curettage resections, aggressive adjuvant surgical \nprocedures are usually necessary.  These procedures are used to remove normal bone \nand ensure a wider surgical margin beyond the transition zone.  Adjuvant procedures \nsuch as cryosurgery, phenol instillation, high-speed burr, reconstitution with cement, \nand/or radiation therapy have been described.  Side effects may include localized bone \nnecrosis, increased risk for fracture, and delayed union of bone.  Radiation therapy may \nbe used and carries the risk of malignant induction to the bone. \nPrognosis for GCTB is excellent if it does not recur.  Recurrent GCTB commonly \nmanifests as localized recurrence, however distant recurrence/metastasis may also \noccur.  The definitive therapy for local recurrences is also surgery.  More aggressive \nsurgery for local recurrences carries significant morbidity and patients with local \nrecurrences are at increased risk for subsequent localized and distant recurrences.   \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 16 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nEventually, patients become surgically unsalvageable.  For some patients with primary \nspinal or sacral lesions, there may be no definitive surgical option.  In these cases, \ntreatment options are limited.  Radiation therapy may control local tumor growth; \nhowever, there is a risk for malignant transformation.  Systemic therapy with \nchemotherapy is of limited value and serial embolization of larger lesions may provide \nsymptomatic relief. \n2.1.2 \nStaging and Grading of Giant Cell Tumor of Bone \nIn general, grades and histologic pattern do not correlate well with prognosis for \nrecurrence or metastasis.  The presence of osteoid product in GCTB is not prognostic \nfor recurrence or metastasis.  Giant-cell rich osteosarcoma may be difficult to \ndifferentiate from benign GCTB.  Likewise, the presence of giant cells in osteosarcoma \nis not prognostic for better outcomes.  A grading scale was described; grade I \n(completely benign), grade II (borderline), and grade III (frankly sarcomatous).  \nGrade I and II have not been correlated with decreased risk for recurrence or metastasis \n(Malawer et al, 2005). \n2.1.3 \nPathophysiology of Giant Cell Tumor of Bone (GCTB) \nGiant Cell Tumors of bone (GCTB) are highly vascularized, expansile osteolytic lesions \nwith indistinct borders and wide transitional zones.  The histological appearance of giant \ncell tumors includes three distinct cell types; multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells, \nspindle-shaped osteoblast-like stromal cells and monocytes (likely precursors of the \ngiant cells).  Although the name GCTB implies that the \u201cgiant cells\u201d are the neoplastic \ncomponent, the true neoplastic component remains unknown and controversial.  The \nsimilarity in appearance of giant cells to normal osteoclasts suggests that the stromal \ncomponent (spindle-shaped cells) may be the true neoplastic component and that the \ngiant cells are the reactive component (Morgan et al, 2005; Zheng et al, 2001).   \nIn archival samples (n = 33) of primary and recurrent GCTB, RANKL was expressed and \ndetected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization.  RANKL expression \nwas observed in the stromal component and osteoprotegerin and RANK were expressed \non the giant cells.  In addition, soluble factors, presumably RANKL, secreted from \nstromal cells of GCTBs are able to induce osteoclastogenesis from peripheral blood \nmonocytes (Nishimura et al, 2005).  Although TGF-b1, MCP-1, TNF IL-1, 6, 11, 17, 18, \nMCS-F and PTHrP are expressed in the tumor, none of these factors are known to \ninduce osteoclast differentiation.  Endothelial cells of normal vessel did not express \nRANK or RANKL (Roudier et al, CTOS 2006).  \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 17 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n2.2 \nDenosumab Background \nPerturbations in the balance between bone formation and resorption can lead to \ngeneralized osteoporosis (resulting from estrogen deficiency and aging) or local bone \nlysis (resulting from rheumatoid arthritis and bone metastases).  RANK-RANK ligand \n(RANKL) system has been identified as an essential mediator of osteoclast formation, \nfunction, and survival (Teitelbaum et al, 2003).  RANKL binds RANK on osteoclasts or \nosteoclast precursors to stimulate or promote differentiation into osteoclasts and activate \nmature osteoclasts to resorb bone.  Therefore, RANKL is a therapeutic target for \ndiseases associated with increased bone resorption. \nDenosumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANKL that binds with high \naffinity (Kd 3 x 10-12 M) and specificity to the soluble and cell membrane-bound forms of \nhuman RANKL.  Denosumab is highly specific because it binds only to RANKL and not \nto other members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, including TNF\u03b1, TNF\u03b2, \nTNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or CD40 ligand (Elliott et al, 2006).  Denosumab \nbinding prevents the activation of RANK and inhibits the formation, activation, and \nsurvival of osteoclasts.  As a consequence, bone resorption and cancer-induced bone \ndestruction are reduced.   \nRefer to the latest version of the investigator brochure for additional and updated \ninformation on denosumab background, clinical experience, and safety information. \n2.2.1 \nClinical Experience With Denosumab in Giant Cell Tumor of Bone \n(GCTB) \nThe Phase 2 study, Study 20040215, investigated the potential role for denosumab in \nthe treatment of GCTB.  The study tested the hypothesis that denosumab, a RANKL \ninhibitor, can inhibit the growth and survival of tumor cells in patients with GCTB.   \nPatients with unresectable or recurrent GCTB were treated with denosumab 120 mg \nadministered SC every four weeks, with additional loading doses on days 8 and 15.  This \ndosing frequency was predicted to attain target serum concentrations of denosumab \nwithin the first month of treatment.   \nThe primary endpoint was tumor response, defined as complete or near complete \nelimination of giant cells or in the absence of histology data, a lack of radiologic \nprogression (single largest dimension < 20% increase by computed tomography [CT] or \nmagnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 18 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nThe primary analysis was conducted of 37 subjects (20 female) with a data cut off date \nof 07 April 2008.  Of these 37 subjects, 35 were evaluable for response to treatment.  \nEighty-six percent (30/35) of subjects had a tumor response:  20 of 20 by histology, and \n10 of 15 by radiology.  Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 33 of the 37 subjects \nincluded in the primary analysis.  One death was reported in a subject diagnosed with \ngiant cell sarcoma who developed disease progression (not treatment-related) during the \noff treatment follow-up period.  No treatment-related serious AEs were reported. \n2.2.2 \nSummary of Effects of OPG-Fc Treatment on Tooth Eruption and \nLong Bone Geometry in Neonate Rats \nGenetic ablation of RANKL in knockout mice, and lifelong inhibition of RANKL by OPG in \ntransgenic rats, was associated with deleterious changes in long bone growth, geometry \nand/or strength (Ominsky et al, 2009; Li et al, 2000; Kong et al, 1999). RANKL knockout \nmice, but not OPG transgenic rats, also exhibited failure of tooth eruption \n(Kong et al, 1999). The pharmacologic effects of RANKL inhibition on tooth eruption and \non long bone growth, geometry, and strength were therefore evaluated in several \nnonclinical studies in neonatal rats. RANKL inhibition in neonatal rats via administration \nof OPG-Fc or RANK-Fc resulted in reduced weight gain, growth plate abnormalities, \nreduced bone length, increased bone mass and increased structural bone strength \nparameters. Although material bone strength parameters were on average unchanged, \nfemoral toughness was consistently reduced. Inhibited tooth eruption and impaired root \ndevelopment were also observed with doses of OPG-Fc that effected a dramatic \nreduction in bone resorption. These effects were partially reversible upon discontinuation \nof OPG-Fc, however, extrinsic long bone strength was reduced and reduced bone \nlength, femur toughness, and abnormal tooth root development persisted.  \nOverexpression of OPG in OPG-transgenic (OPG-Tg) rats prenatally through to skeletal \nmaturity resulted in a suboptimal long bone phenotype. These data suggest that the use \nof denosumab in the rapidly growing skeleton carries potential risks from widened \ngrowth plates, decreased bone growth, decreased bone toughness, and impaired \ndentition. \n2.3 \nRationale \nGCTB is a rare disease characterized clinically by expansile osteolytic lesions and \nhistologically by multi-nucleated giant cells that are similar to osteoclasts, the cells that \nmediate bone destruction.  The tumor cells express RANKL and its receptor, RANK.  \nThe RANK/RANKL pathway is an essential mediator of osteoclast function, formation \nand survival.  Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody of RANKL, inhibits \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 19 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nosteoclast-mediated bone destruction and may provide therapeutic benefit for patients \nwith giant cell tumor.   \nFor subjects with surgically unsalvageable GCTB, current treatment options are limited \nand may include treatments (radiation, embolization, chemotherapy) that lead to \nsignificant disability, poor quality of life and possibly death.  Bisphosphonates are \ncurrently under investigation in this subject population; however, only limited preclinical \nand clinical data are currently available (Cheng et al, 2004). \nStudy 20040215 was an open-label, phase 2 safety and efficacy study of denosumab in \nsubjects (n = 37) with recurrent or unresectable GCTB.  The primary analysis, \ndemonstrated that denosumab has significant biological activity in GCTB based on \nassessment of histologic or radiologic response.  The safety profile of denosumab in this \nstudy appeared to be consistent with that observed in other settings. \nThe potential elimination of osteoclasts by denosumab in subjects with GCTB is \nexpected to inhibit osteolysis and in turn, inhibit the progression of GCTB and potentially \nimprove clinical outcomes for these subjects. \nIn addition, for patients with surgically salvageable GCTB that require severe morbid \nprocedures, treatment with denosumab may reduce the size of the lesion and improve \nsurgical options to allow limb and joint-sparing procedures. \nThere have been rare reported cases of GCTB in adolescents.  Giant Cell Tumor of \nBone (GCTB) usually occurs in skeletally mature adolescents after the epiphyseal plates \nhave closed, and all adolescent subjects enrolled into this study will have radiological \nconfirmation of skeletal maturity.  No further long bone growth is anticipated after \nepiphyseal plates are closed.  In the adolescent subset, eruption of adult dentition may \nnot be complete, but in the majority of cases the non-erupted teeth are likely to be \nlimited to non-essential wisdom teeth, which are absent from many adults.  There are \nfew treatment options for adolescents with mature skeletons and GCTB.  Based on the \nseriousness of GCTB and the limited treatment options, Amgen believes that this \nprotocol, which includes adolescents with mature skeletons and GCTB, presents greater \nthan minimal risk, but also presents the prospect of direct benefit to the subject.  \n2.3.1 \nSelection of Dose \nThe dose and schedule selected for this study consists of a loading dose regimen of \nthree subcutaneous injections of denosumab 120 mg SC Q4W with a loading dose of \n120 mg SC on study days 8 and 15.  This dosing regimen is currently being used in the \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 20 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n \n \nAmgen study 20040215.  Subjects enrolling from study 20040215 will receive \ndenosumab at a dose of 120 mg dosing according to their current Q4W schedule and \nwill not receive any loading doses (ie, study day 8 and 15). \nThe selection of the dose and schedule of denosumab was based on safety, \npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data obtained from the phase 1 and 2 studies \ndescribed above.  Specifically, study 20040113 provided a comprehensive dataset \nguiding the dose selection for subjects with bone metastases.  All the denosumab arms \nshowed biological activity in reducing bone resorption, which was comparable to that \nseen with the IV bisphosphonate arm.  The rate of skeletal-related events in the \ndenosumab arms was similar to that observed in the bisphosphonate arm.  Among the \ndenosumab doses and schedules evaluated, the regimen of 120 mg every 4 weeks was \nassociated with maximum reduction of the bone turnover marker uNTX by week 13, the \nprimary endpoint in the study.  \nUnlike the 30 mg every 4-week dosing, the 120 mg every 4-week schedule avoided low \nexposures of denosumab (eg, serum levels below 4000 ng/mL) that could potentially \ntranslate into reduced efficacy in some subjects based on preliminary population PK/PD \nmodeling of the phase 2 data.  Denosumab was found to be safe and well tolerated in all \nstudy arms.  While no symptomatic hypocalcemia was reported in study 20040113, the \n120 mg every 4-week schedule (n = 41) appeared preferable as no grade 2 or higher \nhypocalcemia was recorded as opposed to 5, grade 2 and one, grade 3 hypocalcemia in \nthe denosumab 180 mg every 4-week treatment group (n = 43). \nThe subjects on this study have active GCTB with surgically unsalvageable or large \nGCTB lesions.  The goal of denosumab treatment is to reduce or halt the growth of the \nGCTB lesion and prevent further osteolysis.  The pharmacodynamic goal is to quickly \nattain target serum concentrations of denosumab and maintain a constant level of \nmaximal suppression of osteoclast activity and bone resorption. \nBased on the PK model, denosumab 120 mg given subcutaneously every 4 weeks \nwould require 6 to 9 months to achieve steady-state.  With the loading doses on \nday 8 and 15, subjects are expected to achieve steady-state within the first month \nresulting in exposure levels that were previously tested in phase 2 studies. \nIn clinical trials denosumab has been administered to adults with a weight as low as \n38 kg.  Adults weighing as low as 38 kg had a similar adverse event profile as compared \nto subjects in higher weight ranges.  It is anticipated that skeletally mature adolescents \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 21 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nweighing at least 38 kg will have a similar adverse event profile as adults in this lower \nweight range.   \n2.4 \nHypotheses \nIt is anticipated that denosumab, an inhibitor of RANKL, will be a well-tolerated treatment \nfor patients with surgically unsalvageable GCTB disease, and patients with surgically \nsalvageable disease whose planned on-study surgery is associated with severe \nmorbidity.  \n3. \nEXPERIMENTAL PLAN \n3.1 \nStudy Design \nThis is a phase 2, international, multi-center, open-label study in subjects with GCTB, \nreceiving denosumab at a dose of 120 mg SC Q4W with a loading dose of 120 mg SC \non study days 8 and 15.   \nThere are 3 cohorts in this study: \n\u2022\nCohort #1:  Subjects with surgically unsalvageable disease (eg, sacral, spinal GCTB,\nor multiple lesions including pulmonary metastases)\n\u2022\nCohort #2: Subjects with surgically salvageable disease whose planned on-study\nsurgery is associated with severe morbidity (eg, joint resection, limb amputation, or\nhemipelvectomy)\n\u2022\nCohort #3:  Subjects who are currently participating in Amgen study 20040215 giant\ncell tumor study who are eligible to enroll\nSubjects who are currently receiving denosumab in study 20040215 will receive \ndenosumab at a dose of 120 mg dosing according to their current Q4W schedule and \nwill not receive any loading doses (ie, study day 8 and 15). \nFor subjects with a complete tumor resection, denosumab treatment continues for \n6 doses after pathological confirmation of partial response (PR) or complete response \n(CR).  In all other cases, denosumab treatment continues until confirmation of disease \nprogression, investigator\u2019s recommendation of discontinuation, Amgen\u2019s \nrecommendation of discontinuation, the subject\u2019s decision to discontinue for any reason, \nor administration of any of the proscribed therapies. \nDuring the time the study is still open, re-treatment may be allowed for subjects who \ndemonstrated a response to denosumab and are currently not receiving denosumab \ntreatment (eg, in the case of recurrent disease while subject is in the safety follow up \nphase or subjects that have completed the study and have later experienced disease \nprogression).  The re-treatment decision including the use of the loading dose and \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 22 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \ndiscontinuation of therapy will be handled on a case-by-case basis; prior authorization \nfrom Amgen is required.  Subjects must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to \nbeing considered for re-treatment.   \nTo evaluate the long-term safety profile of denosumab, data (treatment plus follow-up) \nwill be collected for all subjects enrolled through November 2012 for a minimum of \n60 months, or until death or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first (Section 3.4.2).  For \nsubjects enrolled after November 2012 (PK substudy), data (treatment plus follow-up) \nwill be collected until the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2).   \nSubjects who discontinue(d) investigational product will have an End of Treatment visit \napproximately 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.  Thereafter, they \nwill complete safety follow-up visits approximately every 6 months (\u00b1 1 month) for the \nfirst year and every 12 months (\u00b1 1 month) thereafter until the end of the clinical study \n(Section 3.4.2). \nPrior to Amendment 7 IRB/IEC approval, subjects currently in the safety follow-up in \nstudy 20040215 will continue on the safety follow-up in this study for up to 2 years after \ntheir end of study visit on study 20040215.  The total length of safety follow-up on this \nstudy for patients enrolling from the safety follow-up phase of Amgen study 20040215 \nwill be 2 years less the time spent in safety follow-up on study 20040215.  Upon the \napproval of Amendment 7, subjects who enrolled in 20062004 from the 20040215 study \nwill also follow the 20062004 schedule, and complete the assessments as described in \nAppendix A. \nThe overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the protocol \nsynopsis section. \nThe study endpoints are defined in Section 10.2. \n3.2 \nNumber of Centers \nApproximately 50 sites will participate.  Sites that do not enroll at least one subject within \n6 months of site initiation may be terminated.  \n3.3 \nNumber of Subjects \nParticipants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as \u201csubjects\u201d. \nThe sample size for this study is governed by the number of subjects who qualify for the \nstudy.  It is anticipated that approximately 530 subjects will participate.  Prior to \nAmendment 7, 510 subjects were enrolled.  Following Amendment 7, an additional \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 23 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \napproximately 20 subjects (approximately 10 adolescents and approximately 10 adults) \nwill be enrolled to the PK substudy.  \nNo more than 30 subjects will enroll from the Amgen study 20040215.  No adolescents \nwill enroll into cohort 3, since all subjects participating in study 20040215 are adults \n(\u2265 18 years of age). \n3.4 \nEstimated Study Duration \n3.4.1 \nStudy Duration for Participants \nFor each subject enrolled through November 2012 (before Amendment 7), the total \nduration of a subject\u2019s participation will be at least 60 months including treatment and \nfollow-up, or until death or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first.  For subjects enrolled \nafter November 2012 (PK substudy), data (treatment plus follow-up) will be collected \nuntil the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2).    \nThe total duration of this study from start of enrollment to end of follow-up for the last \nsubject is expected to be approximately 9 years (approximately 4 years of enrollment \nprior to Amendment 7, and approximately 5 years of treatment and follow-up).  \n3.4.2 \nEnd of Study (EOS) \nThe end of the clinical study for all subjects will occur when all subjects enrolled through \nNovember 2012 (before Amendment 7) have completed at least 60 months on study, or \nuntil death or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first.  Study enrollment (prior to \nAmendment 7) concluded in November 2012; therefore the final study visits will be \nconducted and the study is anticipated to end by approximately November 2017.  \nSubjects enrolled in the PK substudy will complete treatment and/or follow-up at the \nsame time as subjects included prior to Amendment 7. \n4. \nSUBJECT ELIGIBILITY \nInvestigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study \ncandidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (ie, age, sex, \nand race), date, and outcome of the screening process (eg, enrolled into study, reason \nfor ineligibility, or refused to participate). \nBefore any study-specific procedure, the appropriate written informed consent must be \nobtained (see Section 12.1).  For adolescents, in addition to written informed consent, \nthe assent of the adolescent also must be obtained if requested by the institutional \nreview board/independent ethics committee. \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 24 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n4.1 \nInclusion Criteria \nSubjects meeting the following criteria are considered eligible for this study. \n4.1.1 Pathologically confirmed giant cell tumor of bone within 1 year before study \nenrollment \n4.1.2 Measurable evidence of active disease within 1 year before study enrollment \n4.1.3 Subjects with surgically unsalvageable disease (eg, sacral, spinal GCTB, or \nmultiple lesions including pulmonary metastases) OR subjects whose planned \nsurgery includes joint resection, limb amputation, hemipelvectomy or surgical \nprocedure resulting in severe morbidity \n4.1.4 Karnofsky performance status \u2265 50% (ie, ECOG status 0, 1, or 2) \n4.1.5 Adults or skeletally mature adolescents (ie, radiographic evidence of at least \n1 mature long bone [eg, humerus with closed growth epiphyseal plate]) \n\u2265 12 years of age \n4.1.6 Skeletally mature adolescents must weigh at least 45 kg \n4.1.7 Before any study-specific procedure is performed, the appropriate written \ninformed consent must be obtained \nInclusion Criteria for 20040215 subjects: \n4.1.8 Subjects currently enrolled in study 20040215 \n4.1.9 Before any study-specific procedure is performed, the appropriate written \ninformed consent must be obtained \n4.2 \nExclusion Criteria \n4.2.1 Currently receiving other GCTB specific treatment (eg, radiation, chemotherapy, \nor embolization) \n4.2.2 Concurrent bisphosphonate treatment \n4.2.3 Known or suspected current diagnosis of underlying malignancy including \nhigh-grade sarcoma, osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant giant cell sarcoma \n4.2.4 Known or suspected current diagnosis of non GCTB giant cell-rich tumors \n4.2.5 Known or suspected current diagnosis of brown cell tumor of bone or Paget\u2019s \ndisease \n4.2.6 Known diagnosis of second malignancy within the past 5 years (subjects with \ndefinitively treated basal cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma in situ are \npermitted) \n4.2.7 Prior history or current evidence of osteonecrosis/osteomyelitis of the jaw \n4.2.8 Active dental or jaw condition which requires oral surgery, including tooth \nextraction \n4.2.9 Non-healed dental/oral surgery \n4.2.10 Planned invasive dental procedure for the course of the study \n4.2.11 Subject currently is enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 30 days since \nending other investigational device or drug study(ies), or subject is receiving \nother investigational agent(s) \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 25 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n4.2.12 Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during \ndosing \n4.2.13 Unstable systemic disease including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, \nunstable angina, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within \n6 months before enrollment  \n4.2.14 Subject is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant within \n5 months after the end of treatment \n4.2.15 Female subject of child bearing potential is not willing to use a highly effective \nmethod of contraception during treatment and for 5 months after the end of \ntreatment \n4.2.16 Subject has any kind of disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to \ngive written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures \nExclusion Criteria for 20040215 subjects: \n4.2.17 Developed sensitivity to mammalian cell derived drug products during the \n20040215 study \n4.2.18 Currently receiving any unapproved investigational product other than \ndenosumab \n4.2.19 Subject is pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant within \n5 months after the end of treatment \n4.2.20 Female subject of child bearing potential is not willing to use a highly effective \nmethod of contraception during treatment and for 5 months after the end of \ntreatment \n4.2.21 Subject has any kind of disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to \ngive written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures \n5. \nSUBJECT ENROLLMENT \nBefore subjects may be entered into the study, Amgen requires a copy of the site\u2019s \nwritten independent ethics committee/institutional review board (IEC/IRB) approval of the \nprotocol, informed consent form, and all other subject information and/or recruitment \nmaterial, if applicable (see Section 12.3). \nAll subjects who enter into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at \nwhich the subject signs the informed consent) will receive a unique subject identification \nnumber before any study procedures are performed.  This number will be used to \nidentify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study \ndocumentation related to that subject.  The subject identification number must remain \nconstant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed at the time of \nrescreening or enrollment.  Subjects enrolling from the 20040215 study will receive a \nnew subject identification number for this study. \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 26 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nThe subject identification number will consist of 9 digits.  The first 3 digits will represent a \nprotocol identifier (ie, 204) and will be identical for all sites.  The next 3 digits will \nrepresent the site number (ie, 101, 102, 103, etc.) and will be identical for all subjects at \na particular site.  The last 3 digits will represent the subject identification and will be \nassigned in sequential order, per site, as subjects are screened (ie, 001, 002, 003, etc.).  \nTherefore, the first subject to enter screening at site 101 will receive the number \n204101001; the second subject at this site will receive the number 204101002, etc. \nOnce the site deems the subject is eligible for enrollment to the study and all screening \nprocedures have been completed, the Eligibility Criteria Worksheet (found in the \nRegulatory Binder) and a case history of the subject\u2019s disease must be completed and \nfaxed to the US or European Sponsor Contact (see cover page for contact information) \nas appropriate, for approval before the first dose of investigational product can be \nadministered to any subject.  The approval process is required for new enrolling subjects \nand subjects considered for retreatment.  Subjects enrolling from Amgen study \n20040215 must complete the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Worksheet, but do not need to \ncomplete the approval process.  The case history must include the treatment history, \nincluding original and translated imaging reports and histopathology reports (specimen \nsource must be clearly identified in the report).  \nThose subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Screening visit and who \nreceive an enrollment confirmation from Amgen may be enrolled into the study and \nbegin the treatment period.  A subject is considered enrolled into the study once the \neligibility criteria worksheet is signed by Amgen.  \n5.1 \nTreatment Assignment \nAs this is an open-label study, all subjects will receive denosumab.  Investigational \nproduct management will be automatically resupplied to the sites through an interactive \nvoice response system (IVRS).  \n6. \nTREATMENT PROCEDURES \nDenosumab is considered to be the investigational product in this study; therefore, drug \naccountability must be obtained on all used and unused denosumab vials.  For further \ndetails regarding preparation and administration of the investigational product, refer to \nthe Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), which is a document \nexternal to this protocol. \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 27 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n6.1 \nInvestigational Product Dosage, Administration, and Schedule \nDenosumab is to be administered by a licensed healthcare professional at a dose of \n120 mg SC Q4W with a loading dose of 120 mg SC on study days 8 and 15.  Subjects \nenrolling from study 20040215 will receive denosumab at a dose of 120 mg dosing \naccording to their current Q4W schedule and will not receive any loading doses \n(ie, study day 8 and 15). \n6.2 \nDose Escalation and Stopping Rules \nFor loading doses, if the study days 8 and 15 doses are delayed more than 8 calendar \ndays, it will be considered a missed dose and recorded as such on the electronic case \nreport form (eCRF).  The next dose is to be given at the next scheduled visit date (based \non study day 1).  There must be at least 4 days (ie, 96 hours) between the study days 1, \n8, and 15 doses (ie, \u00b1 3 days from the scheduled visit date). \nFor Q4W doses, the planned dose may be given up to 7 days before the scheduled \nvisit, as long as there are at least 21 days between doses.  If a planned dose \n(eg, week 5, week 9, etc.) is delayed more than 7 calendar days, it will be considered a \nmissed dose and recorded as such on the eCRF.  The next dose is to be given at the \nnext scheduled visit date (based on study day 1).  \nFor subjects with a complete tumor resection, denosumab treatment continues for \n6 doses after pathological confirmation of partial response or complete response.  In all \nother cases, denosumab treatment continues until confirmation of disease progression, \ninvestigator\u2019s recommendation of discontinuation, Amgen\u2019s recommendation of \ndiscontinuation, the subject\u2019s decision to discontinue for any reason, or administration of \nany of the proscribed therapies.  See Section 3.1 for potential re-treatment with \ndenosumab following discontinuation.  \nAdministration of investigational product is recommended to be withheld 30 days prior to \nany elective invasive oral/ dental procedure.  Investigational product administration is \nrecommended to be withheld until documented evidence of complete mucosal healing \nfollowing any invasive oral/ dental procedure.  \nSubjects with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) on study may temporarily or permanently \ndiscontinue investigational product at investigator discretion.  Re-exposure to \ninvestigational product may occur if the investigator and sponsor agree subject safety \nwill not be compromised. \nThe dosing schedule is described by a schema in the protocol synopsis. \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 28 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n6.3 \nDosage Adjustments \nThere will be no dose adjustments allowed in this study.  \n6.4 \nConcomitant Therapy (Calcium and Vitamin D Supplements) \nAll subjects should be adequately supplemented with calcium and Vitamin D (at \nleast 500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of Vitamin D), except in the case of pre-existing \nhypercalcemia.  Due to differences in regional availability, a dosage form of vitamin D \nthat gives an equivalent of at least 400 IU daily may be given. \nThroughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or \ntreatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those \nlisted in Section 6.5.  \n6.5 \nProscribed Therapy During Study Period \nConcurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is not allowed while the subject is on study.  \nOther active therapy for GCTB including chemotherapy, embolization and radiation \ntherapy are not allowed while the subject is on study (embolization immediately prior to \nplanned definitive surgery [e.g. to improve operative hemostasis] is allowed in \naccordance with local guidelines).  Use of any unapproved (ie, no marketing \nauthorization has been granted) investigational product (other than denosumab) or \ndevice is not allowed until after all study assessments are completed. \nInvasive dental procedures should be avoided.  If a subject undergoes an invasive \ndental procedure while on study, a clinical decision to continue the subject on \ninvestigational product must be documented in the medical chart. \n7. \nSTUDY PROCEDURES \nIt is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain an IEC/IRB-approved, signed, \ninformed consent from all subjects before any protocol-related procedures are \nperformed.  \nStudy visits during the treatment period will occur every 4 weeks until the end of \ntreatment with an additional visit at study days 8 and 15.  For those subjects enrolling \nfrom the 20040215 study, study visits will continue at every 4 week intervals until the end \nof treatment.  When possible, all assessments/procedures during the treatment phase of \nstudy should be obtained within 7 calendar days or less of the specified study visit \n(except during the loading dose period), relative to study day 1.  Every effort should be \nmade to keep subjects on the study schedule as planned from study day 1.   \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 29 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nTo evaluate the long-term safety profile of denosumab, data (treatment plus follow-up) \nwill be collected for all subjects enrolled through November 2012 for a minimum of \n60 months, or until death or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first (Section 3.4.2).  For \nsubjects enrolled after November 2012 (PK substudy), data (treatment plus follow-up) \nwill be collected until the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2).  \nSubjects who discontinue(d) investigational product will have an End of Treatment visit \napproximately 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.

These samples may also be used for future biomarker \ndevelopment testing. \n7.8 \nSample Storage and Destruction \nAny serum or urine samples collected according to the schedule of assessments \n(Appendix A) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 33 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n \n \ntests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure \nanalytical methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study.  \nThis can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred \nsample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  \nAll samples and associated results will be no less than single coded prior to being \nshipped from the site for analysis, or storage.  Tracking of samples will be independent \nof the subject\u2019s identification number for the study.  Results are stored in a secure \ndatabase to ensure confidentiality.   \nIf informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen can do additional testing on \nremaining samples (ie, residual and back-up) to investigate and better understand Giant \nCell Tumor of Bone, the dose response and/or prediction of response to denosumab, \ncharacterize antibody response, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, \nmechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be \ndocumented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  \nSamples can be retained for up to 20 years.   \nSince the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the \ntreatment course, the results of the pharmacokinetic study, biomarker studies, or other \nexploratory studies are not placed in the subject\u2019s medical record and are not to be \nmade available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other \nthird parties, except as specified in the informed consent. \nThe subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by \ncontacting the investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to \nprovide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining \nserum or urine samples and any other components from the cells can be located and \ndestroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol-defined procedures are \ncompleted.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for \ndestruction, will be retained by Amgen. \nThe sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from \nthe sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the \nrequest of the subject through the Investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as \nappropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no \nlonger justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this \nresearch project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 34 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \ncommercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, \ndiscoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample. \n7.9 \nPatient Reported Outcomes - Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form \n(BPI-SF) \nThe BPI-SF is a patient completed questionnaire that has been shown to be a valid \nmeasure of pain in cancer (Cleeland CS, 1991).  It captures information on the intensity \nof pain (pain severity) as well as the degree to which pain interferes with function (pain \ninterference).  The BPI-SF will be collected prior to each administration of investigational \nproduct.  \n7.10 \nEnd of Treatment (EOT) Visit \nEach subject will have an End of Treatment visit approximately 4 weeks after their last \ndose of investigational product.  Study procedures are listed in Appendix A. \n7.11 \nSafety Follow-up Phase \nSubjects who discontinue(d) investigational product will have an End of Treatment visit \napproximately 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.  Thereafter, they \nwill complete safety follow-up visits approximately every 6 months (\u00b1 1 month) for the \nfirst year and then every 12 months (\u00b1 1 month) thereafter until the end of the clinical \nstudy (Section 3.4.2).  During the safety follow-up phase, subjects will be asked \nabout serious adverse events, adverse events of interest, and disease treatments \nand outcomes (Section 9.2). \nUpon the approval of Amendment 7, subjects who enrolled in 20062004 from the \n20040215 study will also follow the 20062004 schedule, and complete the assessments \nas described in Appendix A. \nPrior to Amendment 7 IRB/IEC approval, for subjects who were in the safety follow-up \non study 20040215 and are enrolling in this study, safety data including SAEs, AEs, \nconcomitant medications, and serum samples for anti-denosumab antibody testing will \nbe collected approximately every 6 months for up to 24 months after the end of study \nvisit in the 20040215 study.  Thus, the total length of safety follow-up on this study will \nbe 2 years less the time spent in safety follow-up on Amgen study 20040215. \nThe safety follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months after the End of Treatment visit must be \nconducted in the clinic.  Thereafter, subjects may be contacted by other methods (eg, \ntelephone) to complete the assessments.  \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 35 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nSubjects will be asked to provide information regarding their GCTB status and \ncurrent treatments.  Additionally, subjects will be asked if they have experienced \nany of the following adverse events of interest: \n\u2022\nONJ\n\u2022\nMalignancy, including malignancy in GCTB\n\u2022\nAtypical femoral fracture\nIf the subject has experienced any of the adverse events of interest, specific \nadditional information will be requested/collected as necessary according to each \ntype of event.  The additional information will include, but is not limited to: \n\u2022\nONJ:  dental records; information will be sent for adjudication by\nindependent reviewers (see Section 9.4.1)\n\u2022\nMalignancy (including malignancy in GCTB):  pathology reports\n\u2022\nAtypical femoral fracture:  x-ray or other imaging; medical/surgical\nrecords.  Information will be sent for adjudication by independent\nreviewers (see Section 9.4.1).\nIf the subject has experienced any serious adverse event (Section 9.1.2), \ninformation is to be collected and reported (see Section 9.3). \nIf the subject has been receiving treatment with commercial denosumab (XGEVA), \nor any other Amgen product as standard of care for GCTB or any other condition, \nAdverse Drug Reactions related to that product will be collected. \n8. \nREMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS \n8.1 \nRemoval of Subjects \nSubjects have the right to withdraw fully or partially from the study at any time and for \nany reason without prejudice to his or her future medical care by the physician or at the \ninstitution. \nWithdrawal of full consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive \nfurther investigational treatment and does not wish to or is unable to continue further \nstudy participation.  Any subject may withdraw full consent to participate in the study at \nany time during the study.  The investigator will discuss with the subject the most \nappropriate way to withdraw to ensure the subject\u2019s health.   \nWithdrawal of partial consent means that the subject does not wish to take \ninvestigational product any longer but is still willing to collaborate in providing further \ndata by continuing on study (eg, participate in all subsequent study visits or procedures).  \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 36 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nSubjects may decline to continue receiving investigational product at any time during the \nstudy.  These subjects, as well as those who have stopped receiving investigational \nproduct for other reasons (eg, investigator or sponsor concern) should continue the \nschedule of study observations.   \nReasons for removal from investigational product or observation might include: \n\u2022\nwithdrawal of consent\n\u2022\nadministrative decision by the investigator or Amgen\n\u2022\npregnancy (report on Pregnancy Notification Worksheet, see Appendix C)\n\u2022\nineligibility\n\u2022\nsignificant protocol deviation\n\u2022\nsubject noncompliance\n\u2022\nadverse event\n\u2022\ndisease progression\n\u2022\nadministration of bisphosphonates or other proscribed therapies\n8.2 \nReplacement of Subjects \nNo subjects will be replaced. \n9. \nSAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING \n9.1 \nDefinitions \n9.1.1 \nAdverse Events \nAn adverse event is defined in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) \nGuideline for Good Clinical Practice as \u201cany untoward medical occurrence in a patient or \nclinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not \nnecessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.\u201d (ICH E6:1.2) \nThis definition of adverse events is broadened in this study to include any such \noccurrence (eg, sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of a pre-existing medical \ncondition from the time that a subject has signed informed consent to the time of \nenrollment to or initiation of investigational product. \nThis definition of adverse events also includes worsening of a pre-existing medical \ncondition.  Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition (eg, cancer, \ndiabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, or duration of \nthe condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes. \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 37 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nInterventions for pretreatment conditions (eg, elective cosmetic surgery) or medical \nprocedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered adverse \nevents. \nPregnancy is not considered an adverse event (see Appendix C for reporting any \npregnancy). \nThe investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining \nwhether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from \nvalues before the study.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical \nsignificance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as adverse \nevents; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment in prior \ntherapy are considered adverse events. \n9.1.2 \nSerious Adverse Events \nA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of \nthe following serious criteria: \n\u2022\nis fatal\n\u2022\nis life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)\n\u2022\nrequires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\n\u2022\nresults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity\n\u2022\nis a congenital anomaly/birth defect\n\u2022\nother significant medical hazard\nA hospitalization meeting the regulatory definition for \u201cserious\u201d is any inpatient hospital \nadmission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility excluding \nhospitalizations for anticipated protocol-specified procedures (eg, to perform resection \non affected limb/region with giant cell tumor) or blood product transfusions, if being \nadministered for cancer-related treatment.  However, prolongation of hospitalization or \nre-admission after the subject has been discharged would be considered a Serious \nAdverse Event.  Elective hospitalizations or routine hospitalizations for standard of care \nadministration are not considered to be serious adverse events. \nAny adverse event that does not meet one of the definitions of serious (eg, emergency \nroom visit, outpatient surgery, or requires urgent investigation) may be considered by the \ninvestigator to meet the \u201cother significant medical hazard\u201d criterion for classification as a \nserious adverse event.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and \nblood dyscrasias. \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 38 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n9.2 \nReporting Procedures for All Adverse Events \nThe investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (as defined in \nSection 9.1 and as further specified below) and adverse events of interest \n(Section 7.11) observed by the investigator or reported by subjects during screening \n(excluding cohort 3 subjects), treatment, through the first 6-month safety follow up visit \nas well as through the end of safety follow-up phase for adverse events of interest \n(Section 3.4.2) are collected and recorded in the subjects\u2019 medical records and in \ndesignated study documents (ie, eCRF, and, on the serious adverse event report \n(SAER) form for serious adverse events).  These adverse events will include all serious \nand non serious adverse events (as defined in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2) that occur after \nthe subject has signed the informed consent form.   \nThe following adverse event attributes must be assigned by the investigator:  adverse \nevent diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known); event \ndescription (with detail appropriate to the event); dates of onset and resolution; severity; \nassessment of relatedness to investigational product and action taken.  Diagnoses or \nsyndromes-rather than signs or symptoms-should be recorded.  The investigator may be \nasked to provide follow-up information, discharge summaries, and extracts from medical \nrecords or eCRFs. \nIf applicable, the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational product will be \nassessed by means of the question:  \u201cIs there a reasonable possibility that the event \nmay have been caused by the investigational product?\u201d  The investigator should respond \nto this question with either Yes or No. \nThe severity grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix B. \nMedically significant adverse events considered related to the investigational product by \nthe investigator or the sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable. \nIt will be left to the investigator\u2019s clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse \nevent is related and of sufficient severity to require the subject\u2019s removal from treatment \nor from the study.  A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what \nhe or she perceives as an intolerable adverse event.  If either of these situations arises, \nthe subject should be strongly encouraged to undergo an end-of-study assessment and \nbe under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable. \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 39 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n9.3 \nSerious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures \nSerious adverse events will be collected and recorded beginning with the signing of the \ninformed consent through the end of the safety follow up phase.   \nAll serious adverse events must be reported to Amgen within 24 hours of discovery or \nnotification of the event.  Initial serious adverse event information and all amendments or \nadditions must be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form (Appendix D) and \nfaxed to Amgen Global Safety.  Relevant medical records should be faxed to Amgen \nGlobal Safety as soon as they become available; autopsy reports should be provided for \ndeaths if available.   \nFor all deaths, available autopsy reports and relevant medical reports should be faxed to \nAmgen Global Safety.   \nIf a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study or safety follow-up because of a \nserious adverse event, this information must be included in the initial or follow-up \nSerious Adverse Event Report Form as well as the End of Study or End of Safety \nFollow-up eCRF. \nAmgen will report serious adverse events (SAEs) and suspected unexpected serious \nadverse reactions (SUSARS) as required to regulatory authorities, \ninvestigators/institutions and ethics committees in compliance with all applicable \nregulatory requirements and ICH GCP Guidelines. \nThe investigator should notify the appropriate IRB or ethics committee of serious \nadverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from \nAmgen, in accordance with local procedures and statutes. \n9.4 \nPregnancy and Lactation Reporting \nThroughout denosumab treatment and through 5 months after the last dose of IP, the \ninvestigator should counsel subjects who are women of childbearing potential on the \nrisks of pregnancy while receiving denosumab, and discuss methods to decrease the \nrisk of becoming pregnant.  It is recommended to document these discussions in the \nmedical records. \nIf a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the \nsubject is taking protocol-required therapies report the pregnancy to Amgen as specified \nbelow. \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  15 September 2015 \nPage 40 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \nIn addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should \nreport pregnancies that occur after the last dose of protocol-required therapies through \n5 months after the last dose with the exception of subjects who are receiving a \ncommercial Xgeva in the safety follow-up phase.  For those subjects investigators \nshould report pregnancies until the end of the safety follow-up phase.  \nFor both situation/ scenarios the pregnancy should be reported to Amgen Global \nPatient Safety within 24 hours of the investigator\u2019s knowledge of the event of a \npregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet (Appendix C).  \nAmgen will seek to follow the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy and her baby \nup to 12 months after birth. \nIf a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol-required therapies, \nreport the lactation case to Amgen as specified below.  \nIn addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should report \nlactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol-required therapies through \n5 months after the last dose.  For those subjects receiving a commercial Xgeva in \nthe safety follow-up phase investigators should report lactation cases until the \nend of the safety follow-up phase.  \nAny lactation case should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours \nof the investigator\u2019s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation \nNotification Worksheet (Appendix G). \n9.4.1 \nAdjudication Process for Suspected Osteonecrosis of the Jaw and \nSuspected Atypical Femoral Fracture Adverse Events \nAll subjects with an oral adverse event suspicious of ONJ should be examined by \na dentist or other qualified oral specialist (eg, oral surgeon).  All subjects \npresenting with new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain should be evaluated for a \nsuspected adverse event of atypical femoral fracture. \nAdverse events reported as ONJ or atypical femoral fracture as well as adverse \nevents identified by Amgen as potentially representing ONJ or atypical femoral \nfracture will be reviewed by an independent adjudication panel of experts to \ndetermine whether the pre-defined criteria for ONJ or atypical femoral fracture are \nmet.

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) develops after \nthe epiphyseal plates have closed and is most commonly diagnosed during the third \ndecade of life.  However, cases occur rarely in skeletally mature adolescents (ie, \nadolescents who have closed epiphyseal plates). \nSymptoms that accompany primary GCTB include localized pain, tenderness, and \nswelling and the osteolysis may lead to pathologic fractures, decreased joint motion and \nimpaired function.  Lesions that originate in the spine may also result in neurological \ndeficits.  \nSurgery is the definitive therapy for GCTB and about 80% of primary GCTB patients \nhave lesions amenable to surgical resection.  Although en bloc excisions of the tumor \nmay be curative, they also carry significant morbidity (eg, amputation of a limb, joint \nresection) and greatly influence quality of life.  Curettage procedures with and without \nbone graft may allow for complete resection of the tumor and preservation of the limb or \njoint, but the risk for recurrence is greater.  Larger GCTB lesions may not be amenable \nto curettage resections and may result in severe morbid procedures.  In addition, lesions \nin bones of the hand and distal radius have the highest rate of metastasis even with \nen bloc excision.  Overall, the risk for recurrence is estimated at 10 to 20 percent after \nen bloc excision and at 40% to 75% (Malawer et al, 2005) after curettage, albeit a less \ndebilitating procedure. \nThe GCTB lesion has a wide transition zone and poorly defined borders.  In order to \ndecrease the risk for recurrence with curettage resections, aggressive adjuvant surgical \nprocedures are usually necessary.  These procedures are used to remove normal bone \nand ensure a wider surgical margin beyond the transition zone.  Adjuvant procedures \nsuch as cryosurgery, phenol instillation, high-speed burr, reconstitution with cement, \nand/or radiation therapy have been described.  Side effects may include localized bone \nnecrosis, increased risk for fracture, and delayed union of bone.  Radiation therapy may \nbe used and carries the risk of malignant induction to the bone. \nPrognosis for GCTB is excellent if it does not recur.  Recurrent GCTB commonly \nmanifests as localized recurrence, however distant recurrence/metastasis may also \noccur.  The definitive therapy for local recurrences is also surgery.  More aggressive \nsurgery for local recurrences carries significant morbidity and patients with local \nrecurrences are at increased risk for subsequent localized and distant recurrences.   \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) Protocol Number:  20062004 Date:  15 September 2015 Page 16 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL Eventually, patients become surgically unsalvageable.  For some patients with primary spinal or sacral lesions, there may be no definitive surgical option.  In these cases, treatment options are limited.  Radiation therapy may control local tumor growth; however, there is a risk for malignant transformation.  Systemic therapy with chemotherapy is of limited value and serial embolization of larger lesions may provide symptomatic relief. ",

The presence of osteoid product in GCTB is not prognostic for recurrence or metastasis.  Giant-cell rich osteosarcoma may be difficult to differentiate from benign GCTB.  Likewise, the presence of giant cells in osteosarcoma is not prognostic for better outcomes.

The histological appearance of giant cell tumors includes three distinct cell types; multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells, spindle-shaped osteoblast-like stromal cells and monocytes (likely precursors of the giant cells).  Although the name GCTB implies that the \u201cgiant cells\u201d are the neoplastic component, the true neoplastic component remains unknown and controversial.  The similarity in appearance of giant cells to normal osteoclasts suggests that the stromal component (spindle-shaped cells) may be the true neoplastic component and that the giant cells are the reactive component (Morgan et al, 2005; Zheng et al, 2001).   In archival samples (n = 33) of primary and recurrent GCTB, RANKL was expressed and detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization.  RANKL expression was observed in the stromal component and osteoprotegerin and RANK were expressed on the giant cells.  In addition, soluble factors, presumably RANKL, secreted from stromal cells of GCTBs are able to induce osteoclastogenesis from peripheral blood monocytes (Nishimura et al, 2005).  Although TGF-b1, MCP-1, TNF IL-1, 6, 11, 17, 18, MCS-F and PTHrP are expressed in the tumor, none of these factors are known to induce osteoclast differentiation.  Endothelial cells of normal vessel did not express RANK or RANKL (Roudier et al, CTOS 2006).

                        "Content": " Perturbations in the balance between bone formation and resorption can lead to generalized osteoporosis (resulting from estrogen deficiency and aging) or local bone lysis (resulting from rheumatoid arthritis and bone metastases).  RANK-RANK ligand (RANKL) system has been identified as an essential mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival (Teitelbaum et al, 2003).  RANKL binds RANK on osteoclasts or osteoclast precursors to stimulate or promote differentiation into osteoclasts and activate mature osteoclasts to resorb bone.  Therefore, RANKL is a therapeutic target for diseases associated with increased bone resorption. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANKL that binds with high affinity (Kd 3 x 10-12 M) and specificity to the soluble and cell membrane-bound forms of human RANKL.  Denosumab is highly specific because it binds only to RANKL and not to other members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, including TNF\u03b1, TNF\u03b2, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or CD40 ligand (Elliott et al, 2006).  Denosumab binding prevents the activation of RANK and inhibits the formation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts.  As a consequence, bone resorption and cancer-induced bone destruction are reduced.   Refer to the latest version of the investigator brochure for additional and updated information on denosumab background, clinical experience, and safety information. ",

The study tested the hypothesis that denosumab, a RANKL inhibitor, can inhibit the growth and survival of tumor cells in patients with GCTB.   Patients with unresectable or recurrent GCTB were treated with denosumab 120 mg administered SC every four weeks, with additional loading doses on days 8 and 15.  This dosing frequency was predicted to attain target serum concentrations of denosumab within the first month of treatment.

                                "Content": " Genetic ablation of RANKL in knockout mice, and lifelong inhibition of RANKL by OPG in transgenic rats, was associated with deleterious changes in long bone growth, geometry and/or strength (Ominsky et al, 2009; Li et al, 2000; Kong et al, 1999). RANKL knockout mice, but not OPG transgenic rats, also exhibited failure of tooth eruption (Kong et al, 1999). The pharmacologic effects of RANKL inhibition on tooth eruption and on long bone growth, geometry, and strength were therefore evaluated in several nonclinical studies in neonatal rats. RANKL inhibition in neonatal rats via administration of OPG-Fc or RANK-Fc resulted in reduced weight gain, growth plate abnormalities, reduced bone length, increased bone mass and increased structural bone strength parameters. Although material bone strength parameters were on average unchanged, femoral toughness was consistently reduced. Inhibited tooth eruption and impaired root development were also observed with doses of OPG-Fc that effected a dramatic reduction in bone resorption. These effects were partially reversible upon discontinuation of OPG-Fc, however, extrinsic long bone strength was reduced and reduced bone length, femur toughness, and abnormal tooth root development persisted.  Overexpression of OPG in OPG-transgenic (OPG-Tg) rats prenatally through to skeletal maturity resulted in a suboptimal long bone phenotype. These data suggest that the use of denosumab in the rapidly growing skeleton carries potential risks from widened growth plates, decreased bone growth, decreased bone toughness, and impaired dentition.

                        "Content": " GCTB is a rare disease characterized clinically by expansile osteolytic lesions and histologically by multi-nucleated giant cells that are similar to osteoclasts, the cells that mediate bone destruction.  The tumor cells express RANKL and its receptor, RANK.  The RANK/RANKL pathway is an essential mediator of osteoclast function, formation and survival.  Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody of RANKL, inhibits Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162) Protocol Number:  20062004 Date:  15 September 2015 Page 19 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL osteoclast-mediated bone destruction and may provide therapeutic benefit for patients with giant cell tumor.   For subjects with surgically unsalvageable GCTB, current treatment options are limited and may include treatments (radiation, embolization, chemotherapy) that lead to significant disability, poor quality of life and possibly death.  Bisphosphonates are currently under investigation in this subject population; however, only limited preclinical and clinical data are currently available (Cheng et al, 2004). Study 20040215 was an open-label, phase 2 safety and efficacy study of denosumab in subjects (n = 37) with recurrent or unresectable GCTB.  The primary analysis, demonstrated that denosumab has significant biological activity in GCTB based on assessment of histologic or radiologic response.  The safety profile of denosumab in this study appeared to be consistent with that observed in other settings. The potential elimination of osteoclasts by denosumab in subjects with GCTB is expected to inhibit osteolysis and in turn, inhibit the progression of GCTB and potentially improve clinical outcomes for these subjects. In addition, for patients with surgically salvageable GCTB that require severe morbid procedures, treatment with denosumab may reduce the size of the lesion and improve surgical options to allow limb and joint-sparing procedures. There have been rare reported cases of GCTB in adolescents.  Giant Cell Tumor of Bone (GCTB) usually occurs in skeletally mature adolescents after the epiphyseal plates have closed, and all adolescent subjects enrolled into this study will have radiological confirmation of skeletal maturity.  No further long bone growth is anticipated after epiphyseal plates are closed.  In the adolescent subset, eruption of adult dentition may not be complete, but in the majority of cases the non-erupted teeth are likely to be limited to non-essential wisdom teeth, which are absent from many adults.  There are few treatment options for adolescents with mature skeletons and GCTB.  Based on the seriousness of GCTB and the limited treatment options, Amgen believes that this protocol, which includes adolescents with mature skeletons and GCTB, presents greater than minimal risk, but also presents the prospect of direct benefit to the subject.

Subjects enrolling from study 20040215 will receive \ndenosumab at a dose of 120 mg dosing according to their current Q4W schedule and \nwill not receive any loading doses (ie, study day 8 and 15). \nThe selection of the dose and schedule of denosumab was based on safety, \npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data obtained from the phase 1 and 2 studies \ndescribed above.  Specifically, study 20040113 provided a comprehensive dataset \nguiding the dose selection for subjects with bone metastases.  All the denosumab arms \nshowed biological activity in reducing bone resorption, which was comparable to that \nseen with the IV bisphosphonate arm.  The rate of skeletal-related events in the \ndenosumab arms was similar to that observed in the bisphosphonate arm.  Among the \ndenosumab doses and schedules evaluated, the regimen of 120 mg every 4 weeks was \nassociated with maximum reduction of the bone turnover marker uNTX by week 13, the \nprimary endpoint in the study.  \nUnlike the 30 mg every 4-week dosing, the 120 mg every 4-week schedule avoided low \nexposures of denosumab (eg, serum levels below 4000 ng/mL) that could potentially \ntranslate into reduced efficacy in some subjects based on preliminary population PK/PD \nmodeling of the phase 2 data.  Denosumab was found to be safe and well tolerated in all \nstudy arms.  While no symptomatic hypocalcemia was reported in study 20040113, the \n120 mg every 4-week schedule (n = 41) appeared preferable as no grade 2 or higher \nhypocalcemia was recorded as opposed to 5, grade 2 and one, grade 3 hypocalcemia in \nthe denosumab 180 mg every 4-week treatment group (n = 43). \nThe subjects on this study have active GCTB with surgically unsalvageable or large \nGCTB lesions.  The goal of denosumab treatment is to reduce or halt the growth of the \nGCTB lesion and prevent further osteolysis.  The pharmacodynamic goal is to quickly \nattain target serum concentrations of denosumab and maintain a constant level of \nmaximal suppression of osteoclast activity and bone resorption. \nBased on the PK model, denosumab 120 mg given subcutaneously every 4 weeks \nwould require 6 to 9 months to achieve steady-state.  With the loading doses on \nday 8 and 15, subjects are expected to achieve steady-state within the first month \nresulting in exposure levels that were previously tested in phase 2 studies. \nIn clinical trials denosumab has been administered to adults with a weight as low as \n38 kg.

All subjects who enter into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at which the subject signs the informed consent) will receive a unique subject identification number before any study procedures are performed.  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed at the time of rescreening or enrollment.  Subjects enrolling from the 20040215 study will receive a new subject identification number for this study. Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162) Protocol Number:  20062004 Date:  15 September 2015 Page 26 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL The subject identification number will consist of 9 digits.  The first 3 digits will represent a protocol identifier (ie, 204) and will be identical for all sites.  The next 3 digits will represent the site number (ie, 101, 102, 103, etc.) and will be identical for all subjects at a particular site.  The last 3 digits will represent the subject identification and will be assigned in sequential order, per site, as subjects are screened (ie, 001, 002, 003, etc.).  Therefore, the first subject to enter screening at site 101 will receive the number 204101001; the second subject at this site will receive the number 204101002, etc. Once the site deems the subject is eligible for enrollment to the study and all screening procedures have been completed, the Eligibility Criteria Worksheet (found in the Regulatory Binder) and a case history of the subject\u2019s disease must be completed and faxed to the US or European Sponsor Contact (see cover page for contact information) as appropriate, for approval before the first dose of investigational product can be administered to any subject.  The approval process is required for new enrolling subjects and subjects considered for retreatment.  Subjects enrolling from Amgen study 20040215 must complete the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Worksheet, but do not need to complete the approval process.  The case history must include the treatment history, including original and translated imaging reports and histopathology reports (specimen source must be clearly identified in the report).  Those subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Screening visit and who receive an enrollment confirmation from Amgen may be enrolled into the study and begin the treatment period.  A subject is considered enrolled into the study once the eligibility criteria worksheet is signed by Amgen.  ",

The resulting equation will be:  uNTx/Cr (nM BCE/mM) = uNTx/(Cr*0.0884). Urine will be obtained on a subset of approximately 20 subjects (approximately 10 adolescent and 10 adult subjects) at baseline (prior to administration of investigational product on study day 1) and on study as outlined in the schedule of assessments (Appendix A).  Urine collection instructions A urine sample will be collected from subjects after the first void and preferably in the morning.  It is recommended that urine samples be collected in the clinic, if feasible.  If the subject is to collect the urine sample at home, he/she will need to be provided with containers for sample collection and for transporting the sample to the site on the day of collection.  Subject instructions will be provided on how and when to collect the sample, recording the time of collection, and storing the sample (refrigerated) until it is brought to the study site for processing.

A legally acceptable representative is an individual or other body authorized under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective subject, to the subject\u2019s participation in the clinical study.   If applicable, the investigator is also responsible for asking the subject / subject\u2019s parent or legally acceptable representative if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of the subject\u2019s participation in the clinical study and recording the subject\u2019s preference in the medical chart.

Denosumab 120 mg is given by SC injection as a \n1.7 mL injection of denosumab 70 mg/mL.  \n2.  Safety Follow-Up:  For all subjects, including the PK substudy, data (treatment plus follow-up) will be collected until the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2) \nwhich is when subjects enrolled before Amendment 7 will complete a minimum of 60 months on study or otherwise have discontinued.  For subjects who \ndiscontinue(d) investigational product, safety follow-up visits will be conducted approximately every 6 months (\u00b1 1 month) after the End of Treatment visit \n(approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product) for the first year, then every 12 months (\u00b1 1 month).  The final safety follow-up visit will be \nconducted at the time of the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2) (even if this in not approximately 6 or 12 months since the previous follow-up visit).  Prior to \nAmendment 7, for subjects who were in the safety follow-up of study 20040215 and were enrolling in this study, safety data will be collected approximately every \n6 months for up to 24 months after the end of study visit in the 20040215 study.  Upon the approval of Amendment 7, subjects that enrolled from the 20040215 \nstudy will also follow the 20062004 schedule, and complete the assessments as described in Appendix A.  The safety follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months after the \nEnd of Treatment visit must be conducted in the clinic.  Thereafter, subjects may be contacted by other methods (eg telephone) to complete the assessments. \n3.  Histopathology reports confirming the diagnosis of GCT of bone and demonstrating active disease are to be obtained to determine eligibility at screening (not \nrequired for 20040215 subjects).  All on-study reports are to be attached to the subject\u2019s medical record if performed as standard of care except at end of study \nwhere this may be requested.  \n4.  Histopathology samples may be requested during or at end of study. \n5.  Imaging report will be required at screening to confirm eligibility (not required for 20040215 subjects).  All on-study imaging reports  must be attached to the \nsubject\u2019s medical record if performed as standard of care.  Select historical and select on-study imaging performed as standard of care will be required to be \nsent to a central imaging vendor for evaluation of disease response. \n6.  Serum chemistries performed by local lab must include serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, magnesium and phosphorus.  \n7.  Physical exam: The screening PE includes medical history, Karnofsky performance status, disease status, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, weight \nand height. (After the subject has signed the informed consent and the medical history is recorded on the Medical and Surgical History eCRF, any new or \nworsening conditions should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF, including any reported during the screening period.) Thereafter, only a disease status and \nKarnofsky performance status will be collected during the treatment phase of the study and at 6 and 12 months of safety follow up.   \n8.  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential is to be conducted at screening, on study (approximately every 12 weeks while receiving denosumab \ntreatment) and during safety follow up (only at 6 months after EoT).  A urine/serum pregnancy test must be done at baseline prior to first dose of denosumab if \nstudy day 1 is greater than 7 days from the pregnancy confirmation done at screening. \n9. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO): Consist of BPI-SF. The BPI-SF will be administered prior to each administration of investigational product at baseline, study \ndays 8 and 15, then every 4 weeks (Q4W) from weeks 5 \u2013 25, then every 12 weeks (Q12W) to end of study. \n10. Serum for anti- denosumab antibody assay will be collected at baseline and as outlined on the schedule of assessments, including 2 samples during follow up \n(approximately 6 and 12 months after the end of study visit).  Prior to Amendment 7, for subjects who were in the safety follow-up of study 20040215 and are \nenrolling in this study, serum samples for anti-denosumab antibody assay will be collected approximately every 6 months for up to 24 months after the end of study \nvisit in the 20040215 study.  Upon approval of Amendment 7, subjects that enrolled in 20062004 from 20040215 study will also follow the 20062004 schedule, and \ncomplete the assessments as described in Appendix A.  These samples may also be used for future biomarker development testing  \nProduct:  Denosumab (AMG 162) \nProtocol Number:  20062004 \nDate:  17 July 2015 \nPage 59 of 69 \nCONFIDENTIAL \n \n \n11. Adverse event assessment should be documented and recorded at each visit upon signing informed consent through the first 6 month safety follow-up visit.  \nAdverse events of interest will be followed through the last safety follow-up visit.  Subjects must be followed for adverse events until all denosumab \ntreatment-related toxicities have resolved. \n12. Informed consent may be obtained more than 28 days before Day 1 week 1. \n13. Cohort 3 subjects will enroll at their next Q4W visit (based on their 20040215 schedule).  Informed consent will be obtained prior to any protocol specific \nprocedures; PROs will be collected at their next Q12W assessment visit. \n14. Prior to Amendment 7, for subjects who were in the safety follow-up of study 20040215 and are enrolling in this study, serum chemistries, physical examination, \ndisease status, Karnofsky performance status,and pregnancy testing are not required during the safety follow-up.  Upon the approval of Amendment 7, subjects \nthat enrolled in 20062004 from the 20040215 study will also follow the 20062004 schedule, and complete the assessments as directed in Appendix A. \n15. Pharmacokinetic Substudy \u2013 Approximately 10 adolescent and approximately 10 adult subjects will contribute to the PK substudy.  Samples for pharmacokinetic, \nuNTx, and sCTx analysis on Study Day 1 will be obtained prior to IP administration.  Subjects enrolled in the PK substudy will be followed (treatment plus \nfollow-up) until all subjects enrolled before Amendment 7 complete a minimum of 60 months. \n",
