Therefore, this study will directly evaluate the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), a recombinant FVIII product in clinical development, prophylaxis to reduce bleed rates relative to moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) on-demand therapy, and will compare the clinical outcomes of a high- versus low-frequency prophylaxis dosing regimen in a randomized crossover design.  In addition, younger hemophilia A patients may respond differently to FVIII therapy compared with older children and adults.  Thus, it is important to continue to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in patients with hemophilia. In addition to the FVIII PK data following moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) administration already collected in this study from children younger than 6 years of age, additional opportunity for PK data collection is being provided.  Furthermore, the efficacy and safety of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) during routine prophylaxis treatment will be described in these young patients.Enrollment into the on-demand (OD) cohort has been closed.  To date, there are data indicating that prophylaxis therapy controls bleeding episodes better than on-demand therapy.  Because of availability of FVIII:C PK data following Xyntha administration in children with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approval, enrollment into the PK assessment is optional. Given that prophylaxis has replaced OD therapy as the preferred standard of medical care, the study will continue enrollment into the routine prophylaxis (RP) cohort to assess the effect of a high (25 IU/kg every other day) versus low (45 IU/kg twice per week)-frequency dosing schedule on the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis for male subjects \uf0b36 months to <16 years of age.Primary Objective:To demonstrate that moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis reduces annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) relative to on-demand therapy.  Enrollment into the on-demand (OD) cohort has been closed.Secondary Objectives:To assess the effect of a high (25 IU/kg every other day)- versus low (45 IU/kg twice per week)-frequency dosing schedule on the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis.To continue to characterize the PK of FVIII after moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) administration in children \uf0b36 months to <16 years of age.To describe moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) efficacy and safety in children, including characterization of the incidence of \u201cless than expected therapeutic effect\u201d.Design: This 2-segment study will be an open-label, multicenter trial.  There will have been two cohorts enrolled into the study; one in which the subject practices on-demand therapy for the first segment of the study, followed by routine prophylaxis for the second segment, and, another cohort in which the subject practices routine prophylaxis for both segments.  Study subjects will be hereafter referred to by their Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) \n3082B2-313-WW \u2013 (B1831001) \nFinal Amendment 10, 02 October 2015\nPage 17\nsegment 1 treatment modality: on-demand (OD) subjects and routine prophylaxis (RP) subjects.  Enrollment \nfor the OD cohort has been closed.  Enrollment for the RP cohort is ongoing.\nAll RP subjects will practice prophylaxis with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) study drug according to one of two\nrandomly assigned moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) regimens, each delivering approximately 90 IU/kg/week, but \ndiffering in dosing schedule.  Randomization will be stratified by hemophilia A severity: FVIII activity \n<1% or 1-2% (central laboratory screening result).  Each segment will be 12 months in duration. In the first \nsegment, subjects will be randomly assigned to Regimen A: 45 \uf0b15 IU/kg, administered twice per week or \nRegimen B: 25 \uf0b15 IU/kg, administered every other day.\nAfter completion of the first segment, all subjects will cross over to the second prophylactic regimen for \nsegment 2.  Subjects who received Regimen A in segment 1 will follow Regimen B in segment 2.  \nConversely those subjects who received Regimen B in segment 1 will follow Regimen A in segment 2.\nDuring prophylaxis, a subject\u2019s treatment will be escalated to a higher intensity prophylaxis regimen \ncomprised of the most intensive components of both regimens A and B (45 \uf0b15 IU/kg, administered every \nother day) if criteria justifying regimen escalation are met: over a 4-week period, the occurrence of 2 or \nmore spontaneous joint bleeds or the occurrence of 3 or more spontaneous bleeds (consisting of joint bleeds, \nand/or significant soft tissue/muscle or other site bleeds).  Subjects who meet dose escalation criteria while \non this more intensive regimen may dose escalate to a higher intensity regimen designated by the \ninvestigator.  During prophylaxis, subjects will also use moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), as needed, for the \ntreatment of bleeds (ie, on-demand), should they occur.\nClinical and laboratory examinations, including assessments for FVIII inhibitor development, will be \nconducted during the course of the study.\nMoroctocog alfa (AF-CC) efficacy and safety will be assessed over the entire treatment period.\nA subset of subjects may participate in assessments for FVIII PK characterization after administration of \nmoroctocog alfa (AF-CC).  This subset of subjects will undergo a baseline PK assessment, receiving a single \nopen-label dose of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) (50 \uf0b15 IU/kg, rounded to the closest complete vial) with blood \nsampled for FVIII activity measurements before and at 0.5, 8, 24, 28 (optional), and 32 hours after the start \nof infusion. \nMain Inclusion Criteria: Males \uf0b36 months to <16 years of age at the time of screening visit with \nmoderately severe to severe hemophilia A (FVIII activity \uf0a32%), with previous FVIII replacement therapy \nexperience (\uf0b320 exposure days).\nMain Exclusion Criteria: Current or history of FVIII inhibitor.\nConcomitant Treatment: Regular medication, other than FVIII concentrates, may continue unchanged.\nTest Articles(s) and Administration: Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) study drug; single 50 \uf0b15 IU/kg (rounded to \nclosest complete vial) intravenous infusions administered for PK assessment;either 45 IU/kg twice per week \nor 25 IU/kg every other day for prophylaxis treatment (or according to investigator prescription in the event \nthat escalation criteria are met while the subject is practicing the initial protocol-defined escalated regimen).\nSafety Evaluation: Safety variables will be as follows: the incidence of adverse events (by severity and by \nrelationship to moroctocog alfa (AF-CC)); the incidence of FVIII inhibitor development, development of \nantibodies to moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), CHO cell proteins, and TN8.2.  Laboratory-based assessments for \nFVIII inhibitor will be conducted at intervals of approximately every 3 months.\nEfficacy Evaluation: Efficacy variables will include ABR, number of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) infusions \nper bleed, response of bleed to moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) treatment (4-point scale of assessment), time \nMoroctocog alfa (AF-CC) \n3082B2-313-WW \u2013 (B1831001) \nFinal Amendment 10, 02 October 2015\nPage 18\ninterval between bleed onset and prior moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) routine prophylaxis dose, incidence of \nprophylaxis regimen escalation, incidence of less than expected therapeutic effect (LETE), consumption of \nmoroctocog alfa (AF-CC), and compliance with assigned prophylaxis regimen.  All subjective assessments \nwill be provided by the caregiver or investigator.\nPharmacokinetics: FVIII activity in plasma (FVIII:C) will be analyzed using noncompartmental methods \nand the following PK parameters calculated for each subject: FVIII:C 0.5 hours after the beginning of the \ninfusion (C0.5hr), incremental recovery, area-under-the FVIII:C-time curve to the last measureable FVIII:C \n(AUCt) and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC\u221e), terminal phase half-life (t\u00bd), clearance (CL), steady-state \nvolume of distribution (Vss), and mean residence time (MRT). Summary statistics of each parameter will be \nreported.\nStatistical Considerations, General: This study will provide descriptive safety, efficacy and PK data of \nmoroctocog alfa (AF-CC) treatment in previously treated pediatric patients at least 6 months to <16 years of \nage. The sample size of each cohort of the study was based on the statistical comparison of ABR between \nthe first and second segments.  Additional information regarding sample size estimates is provided below.\nStatistical Considerations, Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a \nmean change in ABR during a period of protocol-defined moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis \n(~25 \uf0b15 IU/kg, administered every other day) compared to a period of on-demand therapy with moroctocog \nalfa (AF-CC).  Only subjects who practice on-demand therapy with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) during \nsegment 1, before starting protocol-defined moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis in segment 2, will be \nincluded in this analysis.  For these subjects, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to \ncompare the mean ABR during their on-demand and prophylaxis treatment periods.  In a completed ReFacto \nPreviously Untreated Patients (PUP) study (3082A1-301-WW), a reduction in the ABR was observed for \nsubjects during their periods of prophylaxis (\uf0b32 infusions per week) compared to their periods of on-demand \ntherapy (reduction of 5.7 \uf0b16.9 bleeds per year [11.85 to 6.15 bleeds per year], ABR decrease of 48%, N=39).  \nBased upon this experience, a more conservative decrease in ABR of 40% (corresponding to a mean change \nof 4.75 bleeds per year) and a standard deviation of 7 were selected for use in sample size calculations.  A \nsample size of 18 OD subjects who practice on-demand therapy in segment 1, followed by prophylaxis in \nsegment 2, provides 80% power to detect such a difference using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  Due to an \nexpected attrition rate of up to 25%, approximately 24 OD subjects, who practice on-demand therapy during \nsegment 1, were planned to be enrolled to ensure that 18 are evaluable for the comparison of ABRs in the \non-demand versus the prophylaxis setting.  Because enrollment into the OD cohort has been closed, all \navailable data will be analyzed.\nStatistical Considerations, Secondary Objectives: A secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of \ndosing schedule on prophylactic efficacy. For the comparison of high-versus low-frequency prophylaxis \ndosing schedule, a subset analysis of data from the completed ReFacto PUP study (Wyeth protocol \n3082A1-301-WW) revealed an ABR of 5.7 \uf0b15.2 (N=26) in patients receiving a high-frequency prophylaxis \nregimen (3 infusions per week) compared to an ABR of 7.1 \uf0b14.1 (N=13) in patients receiving a \nlower-frequency prophylaxis regimen (2 infusions per week).  However, the treatment assignment was not \nrandomized and prophylaxis regimens were not controlled in that study.  To avoid selection bias and \ninter-patient variability affecting outcome, two protocol-defined prophylaxis regimens (a high- and a \nlow-frequency dosing regimen) will be assessed in a crossover design. Assuming an intra-class correlation \nof 30% and a standard deviation of 6 bleeds per year based on this previous ReFacto PUP study, a \nwithin-subject standard deviation of 5 bleeds per year was used for sample size calculations for the \ncomparison between the 2 protocol-defined prophylaxis regimens (A and B).  Given this, 36 RP cohort \nsubjects are needed to provide 80% power to demonstrate equivalence of the two regimens.  Allowing for an \nattrition rate of 25%, approximately 48 RP subjects need to be enrolled to support this objective.\nBased on a sample size re-estimation using data from the ongoing study, a difference of means of 1.3 bleeds \nper year between the two protocol-defined prophylaxis regimens with a corresponding standard deviation of \nthe difference of 6.5 was obtained requiring 38 subjects to provide 80% power to demonstrate equivalence \nMoroctocog alfa (AF-CC) \n3082B2-313-WW \u2013 (B1831001) \nFinal Amendment 10, 02 October 2015\nPage 19\nof the two regimens (A and B).  Allowing for an attrition rate of 30%, approximately 56 RP subjects would \nneed to be enrolled. The two prophylaxis regimens will be considered equivalent if the limits of the 2-sided \n90% confidence interval for the difference in observed mean ABRs fall wholly within the interval defined by \nfewer than 4 bleeds per year.\nFVIII:C pharmacokinetics after administration of moroctocog alfa and moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) have been \nwell described in a wide range of ages.  Younger patients (median age 10 \uf0b18.3 months, N=59) had lower \nrecoveries than older patients (median age 26 \uf0b112 years, N=101), with mean values of 1.5 \uf0b10.6 and \n2.4 \uf0b10.4 IU/dL per IU/kg, respectively.  Younger children have also been observed to have higher clearance \nof FVIII:C when adjusted by weight and shorter half-lives.  A secondary objective of this study allows for \ncontinued characterization of the FVIII:C PK after administration of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in children \nyounger than 16 years of age, thus improving our understanding the FVIII:C pharmacokinetics in children.  \nDescriptive statistics of single-dose PK parameters will define this characterization.  Subjects opting to \nparticipate are required to be \uf0b36 months to <16 years of age at the time of the baseline PK assessment.\nInterim Report and Analysis: An independent data monitoring committee will provide guidance during the \ncourse of the study, with review intervals of approximately every 6 months.  Prior to study completion, \nselected (safety, efficacy and/or PK) data from this study may be summarized and reported to regulatory \nauthorities to support regulatory submissions or requests. The analyses for these summaries would be based \non descriptive statistics.\nPer discussions with the FDA, a final report for the OD cohort will be submitted comparing prophylaxis \nefficacy and safety versus on-demand therapy according to Section 3.3 of the statistical analysis plan.\nAdditionally, after approximately 38 evaluable RP subjects, who practiced prophylaxis for both segment 1\nand segment 2, complete the study, a final report for the RP cohort will be submitted.\nEthical Considerations: This study will be conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations \nincluding, but not limited to, the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical \nPractice (GCP) and the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The \ninstitutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) must review and approve the protocol \nand informed consent form (ICF) before any subjects are enrolled.  Before any procedures specified in the \nprotocol are performed, the subject\u2019s legally authorized representative must sign and date the \nIRB/IEC-approved informed consent form.\nMoroctocog alfa (AF-CC) 3082B2-313-WW \u2013 (B1831001) Final Amendment 10, 02 October 2015Page 20",

The duration of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) treatment \nin this study (18 - 24 months depending on the cohort) ensures that sufficient experience with \nmoroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is obtained.\nPharmacokinetic assessment of FVIII:C after FVIII therapy has shown lower FVIII:C\nrecovery, in young children. For moroctocog alfa, this has also been observed: a mean\nincremental recovery of 1.5 \uf0b10.6 IU/dL per IU/kg, in 59 children with median age 10 \uf0b18.3 \nmonths was reported compared with mean incremental recovery of 2.4 \uf0b10.4 IU/dL per IU/kg\nin 101 patients with a median age of 26 \uf0b112 years.18  Younger patients also have higher \nclearance, when adjusted for body size and shorter half-lives compared with older children \nand adults.

                "Content": "There will have been two cohorts enrolled into the study; one in which the subject practices on-demand therapy for the first segment of the study, followed by routine prophylaxis for the second segment, and, another cohort in which the subject practices routine prophylaxis for both segments.  Study subjects will be hereafter referred to by their segment 1 treatment modality: on-demand (OD) subjects and routine prophylaxis (RP) subjects.  Enrollment into the OD cohort has been closed. Enrollment for the RP cohort is ongoing.Enrollment for the RP cohort will continue and will be conducted as an open-label, multicenter trial of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in approximately 56 subjects (\uf0b36 months to <16 years of age) with moderately severe to severe hemophilia A.  The study will be conducted in two 12-month segments (Also refer to Section 6).At study start, a subset of subjects may participate in optional assessments to characterize the PK of FVIII after moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) administration.  Subjects who are eligible and opt to participate will undergo a baseline PK assessment, receiving a single open-label dose of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) (50 \uf0b15 IU/kg rounded to the nearest complete vial) with blood sampled for FVIII activity measurements before and at 0.5, 8, 24, 28 (optional), and 32 hours after the start of the infusion. All RP subjects will practice prophylaxis with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) according to 1 of 2 randomly assigned moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) regimens, each delivering approximately 90 IU/kg/week, but differing in dosing schedule.  Randomization will be stratified by hemophilia A severity: FVIII activity <1% or 1-2% (central laboratory screening result).  Each segment will be 12 months in duration.Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) 3082B2-313-WW \u2013 (B1831001) Final Amendment 10, 02 October 2015Page 29In the first segment, subjects will be randomly assigned to Regimen A: 45 \uf0b15 IU/kg, administered twice per week or Regimen B: 25 \uf0b15 IU/kg, administered every other day.For regimen A, the interval between prophylactic infusions should be 3 to 4 days, and should not exceed 4 days.  For regimen B, the interval between prophylactic infusions should be approximately 48 hours (eg, an appropriate dosing schedule for Regimen B is as follows Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Monday\u2026etc). After completion of the first segment, all subjects will cross over to the alternate prophylactic regimen for segment 2.  Subjects who received Regimen A in segment 1 will follow regimen B in segment 2.  Conversely, those subjects who received Regimen B in segment 1 will follow Regimen A in segment 2.During prophylaxis, a subject\u2019s treatment will be escalated to a higher intensity prophylaxis regimen comprised of the most intensive components of both regimens A and B (45 \uf0b15 IU/kg, administered every other day) if criteria justifying regimen escalation are met (see Section 15.3.3).  Subjects who meet dose escalation criteria while on this more intensive regimen may dose escalate to a higher intensity regimen designated by the investigator.  The subject will follow the assigned regimen(s) until the respective 12-month period of prophylaxis with study drug has been completed (segment 1 or 2); the 12-month period is inclusive of treatment time on all the prophylaxis regimens assigned during the respective study segment.  During prophylaxis, subjects will also use moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), as needed, for the treatment of bleeds (ie, on-demand), should they occur.Clinical and laboratory examinations, including assessments for FVIII inhibitor development, will be conducted during the course of the study.",

Prospective subjects may be notified of the study\u2019s existence, but no study procedures may be performed before obtaining informed consent/assent.  The investigator will maintain a subject-screening logbook at the study site.  All subjects screened at the study site will be entered into the logbook (see Section 23).After obtaining informed consent/assent, the investigator and monitor determine a subject\u2019s eligibility by history and specific laboratory assays.  The central laboratory will be used for all screening blood tests.  The local laboratory will also be used specifically for 2 tests: FVIII activity (FVIII:C) and FVIII inhibitor.  Local laboratory measurements of FVIII:C and FVIII inhibitor will be used by the investigator to assess eligibility, although parallel samples will be analyzed at the central laboratory and will also be used to confirm eligibility for subjects.  (NOTE: During the treatment phase of the study, all tests for FVIII:C and/or FVIII inhibitor performed at the local laboratory should have duplicate samples from the same phlebotomy shipped to the central laboratory for analyses.  The treatment phase starts at visit 2 and ends at the Final Study Visit.)  If the local or central laboratory results for either FVIII:C or FVIII inhibitor show the subject is ineligible, the subject will be considered a screen failure.

In the event that a subject develops a confirmed FVIII inhibitor, the investigator will contact the Sponsor. The Sponsor and the investigator will determine whether the subject will remain in the study or be withdrawn from the study.Subjects withdrawn from the study will complete the procedures of the Final Study Visit and Final Study Contact as described in Section 15.1.11 and 15.1.12 for RP subjects.  In addition to the Final Study Visit procedures described in Section 15.1.11 for RP subjects, subjects with a confirmed FVIII inhibitor should be rechallenged, unless medically contraindicated, with a single moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) infusion of 50 \uf0b15 IU/kg at the Final Study Visit, following the 72-hour FVIII washout required for this visit (see Study Reference Manual for instructions regarding study drug reconstitution, administration, and data recording).All blood sample collections required at the Final Study Visit (see Section 15.1.11 for RP subjects), as well as the physical examination and collections of weight and vital signs, will occur before the moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) infusion for rechallenge.  A blood sample will be collected at 0.5 hours (\u00b13 minutes) after administration of the rechallenge infusion and sent to the central laboratory for FVIII: C analysis.  Vital signs (including temperature [Celsius], blood pressure, pulse, and respiration) will be collected just before (ie, within approximately 20 minutes of) the 0.5-hour sample collection.  Three (3) to 5 days (inclusive of a 72-hour FVIII washout if possible) after the moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) infusion for rechallenge, blood samples will be collected for FVIII:C, FVIII inhibitor, and anti-FVIII antibody testing at the central laboratory.  Samples collected for the rechallenge analysis must be prepared and identified according to instructions provided in the Study Reference Manual.  After at least 28 days following the Final Study Visit, the subject will complete the procedures of the Final Study Contact, as described in Section 15.1.12 for RP subjects.NOTE: All tests for FVIII:C and/or FVIII inhibitor performed at the local laboratory should have duplicate samples from the same phlebotomy shipped to the central laboratory for analyses.  In cases of FVIII inhibitor development, these duplicate analyses will continue until the Final Study Contact.  Thus, a duplicate sample of all samples tested at the local laboratory for FVIII inhibitor development should also be sent to the central laboratory for confirmatory testing.

The criteria for regimen escalation will be the occurrence of either of the following:a.2 or more spontaneous (atraumatic) bleeds into major joints (such as elbow, ankle, or knee joint) and/or into other target joints over a 4-week (28-day) period in the absence of a confirmed FVIII inhibitor.ORb. 3 or more spontaneous (atraumatic) bleeds (consisting of joint bleeds and/or significant soft tissue/muscle or other site bleeds) over a 4-week (28-day) period in the absence of a confirmed FVIII inhibitor.Significant spontaneous bleeds are defined as those that lead to a transient or persistent loss of function.19  The loss of function may be transient and may evidence itself by a reluctance of the subject to utilize the affected body part in usual activities be it on account of pain, associated swelling or limitation in motion.  This specification is intended to prevent regimen escalation based upon clinically insignificant or minor bleeding episodes (eg, ecchymoses, epistaxis). The investigator will review these criteria with the subject/caregiver at the time study drug is first dispensed for protocol-assigned prophylaxis treatment, during telephone contacts, and at study visits.  In the event that any of the criteria for regimen escalation are met, the subject/caregiver must contact the investigator as soon as possible, and the investigator will confirm that the subject has met criteria.  The subject\u2019s treatment will be escalated to a higher intensity prophylaxis regimen comprised of the most intensive components of both regimens A and B: 45 \uf0b15 IU/kg, administered every other day.  The investigator will provide the subject/caregiver with instructions for the new, more intense prophylaxis regimen.  The subject will now follow the protocol-assigned regimen escalation, and arrangements for adequate study drug supplies will be made.  Further prophylaxis regimen escalations will be prescribed by the investigator with each recurrence of escalation criteria.  The subject will follow the assigned regimen(s) until the respective 12-month period of prophylaxis with study drug has been completed (segment 1 or 2); the 12-month period is inclusive of treatment time on all the prophylaxis regimens assigned during the respective study segment.",

For this purpose, spontaneous bleeds are further categorized as \u201csignificant\u201d.  Significant spontaneous bleeds are defined as those that lead to a transient or persistent loss of function (see Section 15.3.3).Traumatic Bleeding Episodes: Bleeding episodes should be classified as traumatic if a subject records a bleeding event when there is a known or presumed reason for the bleed.  For example, if a subject were to exercise strenuously and then have a bleed in the absence of any obvious injury, the bleed would be recorded as a traumatic bleed.

LETE can occur in 3 specific circumstances.  All types of LETE in aggregate and individually will be summarized as part of the efficacy information collected in this study.  The following criteria define LETE.Less than Expected Therapeutic Effect in the On-Demand SettingLETE occurs in the on-demand setting if the subject records 2 successive \u201cNo Response\u201d ratings after 2 successive study drug infusions, respectively.  The infusions must have been administered within 24 hours (\uf0a324 hours) of each other for treatment of the same bleeding event in the absence of confounding factors (described below).  Therefore, LETE in the on-demand setting is based on the response to treatment of a bleed.  The only confounding factors are as follows:\uf0b7Known presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor.\uf0b7Known inadequate dose for the type and/or severity of bleed in the opinion of the investigator.\uf0b7Delay of greater than 4 hours between onset of bleed to infusion.\uf0b7Delay of greater than 24 hours before administration of a follow-up infusion.\uf0b7Known compromised study drug.\uf0b7Faulty administration of study drug.\uf0b7The subject has an underlying, predisposing condition responsible for the bleed in the opinion of the investigator (eg, kidney stones or use of medications known to impair platelet function, such as aspirin or NSAIDs).For the purposes of this study, LETE in the on-demand setting will be summarized only from eCRFs.

Therefore, LETE in the prophylaxis \nsetting is the occurrence of a bleed.  The only confounding factors are as follows:\n\uf0b7\nKnown presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor.\n\uf0b7\nKnown inadequate prophylactic dose (ie, a dose less than that prescribed in subject\u2019s \nregimen).\n\uf0b7\nKnown lack of adherence to the prescribed prophylaxis regimen.\n\uf0b7\nBleed occurs in a target joint identified at the start of the study.\n\uf0b7\nKnown compromised study drug.\n\uf0b7\nFaulty administration of study drug.\n\uf0b7\nThe subject has an underlying, predisposing condition responsible for the bleed in the \nopinion of the investigator (eg, kidney stones or use of medications known to impair \nplatelet function, such as aspirin or NSAIDs).\nFor the purposes of this study, LETE in the prophylaxis setting will be summarized only \nfrom eCRFs.  In the absence of identified confounding factors, monitors will query a site if a \nspontaneous bleed within 48 hours (\u226448 hours) of a prophylactic dose is recorded and LETE \nis not noted.\nLess than Expected Therapeutic Effect (Low Recovery)\nLETE can also be lower than expected recovery of FVIII in the opinion of the investigator \nfollowing infusion of study drug in the absence of confounding factors.  There are no planned \nrecovery measurements outside the PK assessment that subjects may undergo at study start.  \nDuring the course of this study, additional recovery measurements should be done only for \nassessment of a possible FVIII inhibitor.  (NOTE: During the treatment phase of the study, \nall tests for FVIII:C and/or FVIII inhibitor performed at the local laboratory should have \nduplicate samples from the same phlebotomy shipped to the central laboratory for analyses.)  \nTherefore, LETE (Low Recovery) can happen only if a recovery measurement is performed \nfor clinical management of a subject and an inhibitor is not confirmed by the central \nlaboratory.  The only confounding factors for low recovery are as follows:\n\uf0b7\nKnown presence or subsequent identification of a FVIII inhibitor.\n\uf0b7\nKnown compromised study drug.\n\uf0b7\nFaulty administration of study drug.\nMoroctocog alfa (AF-CC) 3082B2-313-WW \u2013 (B1831001) Final Amendment 10, 02 October 2015Page 59",

ABRs will reflect the incidence of bleeds treated with FVIII replacement therapy.  To avoid potential bias related to prior treatment, the first month of each protocol-defined prophylaxis treatment will serve as a washout period; ABR analyses will be performed with and without data from this washout period. \uf0b7For the primary objective of demonstrating that moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis reduces the ABR relative to on-demand therapy, the null hypothesis is that prophylactic treatment does not reduce the ABR relative to on-demand treatment.  The alternative hypothesis is that prophylactic therapy does reduce the ABR.\uf0b7To test the hypothesis, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to compare the mean ABR between subjects in on-demand (segment 1) and prophylaxis (segment 2) treatment regimens.  Only subjects who practice on-demand therapy with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) during segment 1, before starting the protocol-defined moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis in segment 2, will be included in this analysis.  The ANOVA will include factors for treatment regimen (study segment 1 or 2).  The model will also include a blocking factor for subjects to ensure that the comparison of ABRs from each treatment regimen is performed on a within subject basis.  The p-value for treatment regimen calculated in ABR of the ITT population will be used to test the null hypothesis; a p-value less than 0.05 will be considered significant.\uf0b7For the secondary objective of assessing the effect of a high- versus low-frequency dosing schedule on the efficacy of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis, the null hypothesis is that there is a difference in mean ABR between the two prophylaxis regimens.  The alternative hypothesis is that the two prophylaxis regimens are similar enough to be considered clinically equivalent.  To test this hypothesis, the twoprotocol-defined prophylaxis regimens (a high- and a low-frequency dosing regimen) will be assessed in a crossover design.  Only subjects who practice protocol-defined prophylaxis regimens in segment 1 and 2, respectively: the low- followed by the high-frequency dosing regimen (AB), or the high- followed by the low-frequency dosing regimen (BA) will be included in this analysis.The 90% 2-sided confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference in ABRs for the 2 prophylaxis regimens for ITT subjects will be constructed using the t distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom (n equals the number of subjects) to assess the equivalence of these 2 regimens.

                "Content": "The sample size of each cohort of the study is based on the statistical comparison of ABR between the first and second segments.  Data from a previous ReFacto PUP study (Wyeth protocol 3082A1-301-WW) guided assumptions for the sample size estimates for objectives of this study.  Additional information regarding each of these sample size estimates is provided below.In the completed ReFacto 3082A1-301-WW PUP study, a reduction in the ABR was observed for subjects during their periods of prophylaxis (\uf0b32 infusions per week) compared to their periods of on-demand therapy (reduction of 5.7 \uf0b16.9 bleeds per year, [11.85 to 6.15 bleeds per year], ABR decrease of 48%, N=39).  Based upon this experience, a more conservative decrease in ABR of 40% (corresponding to a mean change of 4.75 bleeds per year) and a standard deviation of 7 were selected for use in power calculations for the comparison of ABRs in the on-demand versus prophylaxis setting for this study (see Section 22.4.2 for description of statistical analysis).  A sample size of 18 OD subjects who practice on-demand therapy in segment 1, followed by prophylaxis in segment 2, provides80% power to detect such a difference using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.  Due to an expected attrition rate of up to 25%, approximately 24 OD subjects, who practice on-demand therapy during segment 1, were planned to be enrolled to ensure that 18 are evaluable for the comparison of ABRs in the on-demand versus prophylaxis setting.  Because enrollment into the OD cohort has been closed, all available data will be analyzed.For the RP cohort, the comparison of high- versus low-frequency prophylaxis dosing schedules, a subset analysis of data from the completed ReFacto PUP study (Wyeth protocol 3082A1-301-WW) revealed an ABR of 5.7 \uf0b15.2 (N=26) in patients receiving a high-frequency prophylaxis regimen (3 infusions per week) compared to an ABR of 7.1 \uf0b14.1 (N=13) in patients receiving a lower-frequency prophylaxis regimen (2 infusions per week).  However, the treatment assignment was not randomized and prophylaxis regimens were not controlled in that study.  To avoid selection bias and inter-patient variability affecting outcome, two protocol-defined prophylaxis regimens (a high- and a low-frequency dosing regimen) will be assessed in a crossover design. Assuming an intraclass correlation of 30% and a standard deviation of 6 bleeds per year based on this previous ReFacto PUP study, a within-subject standard deviation of 5 bleeds per year was used for sample size calculations for the comparison between the two protocol-defined prophylaxis regimens (A and B).  Given this, 36 RP subjects are needed to provide 80% power to demonstrate equivalence of the two regimens (see Section 22.5.3 for description of statistical analysis).  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) 3082B2-313-WW \u2013 (B1831001) Final Amendment 10, 02 October 2015Page 66Allowing for an attrition rate of 25%, approximately 48 RP subjects need to be enrolled to support this objective.Based on a sample size re-estimation using data from this ongoing study, a difference of means of 1.3 bleeds per year between the two protocol-defined prophylaxis regimens (A and B) with a corresponding standard deviation of the difference of 6.5 was obtained requiring 38 subjects to provide 80% power to demonstrate equivalence of the two regimens.  Allowing for an attrition rate of 30%, approximately 56 RP subjects need to be enrolled.  The two prophylaxis regimens will be considered equivalent if the limits of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval for the difference in observed mean ABRs fall wholly within the interval defined by fewer than 4 bleeds per year.",

A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product; 2. An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).3. A male has been exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception or is exposed during his partner\u2019s pregnancy.If a study subject or study subject\u2019s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study subject\u2019s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this information to the Pfizer drug safety unit on an SAE report form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or (pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up to theinitial EDP Form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) 3082B2-313-WW \u2013 (B1831001) Final Amendment 10, 02 October 2015Page 74Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as serious adverse events follows: \uf0b7\u201cSpontaneous abortion\u201d includes miscarriage and missed abortion;\uf0b7Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as serious adverse events.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as serious adverse events when the investigator assesses the neonatal death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product.Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the investigator.  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the study subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.

In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of subjects\u2019 personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws.The informed consent/assent documents must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws.The informed consent/assent documents used during the informed consent process must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection.The investigator must ensure that each study subject or his legally acceptable representative, or parent(s) or legal guardian if a minor, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. Whenever consent is obtained from a subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative/parent(s) or legal guardian, the subject\u2019s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC.  If the investigator determines that a subject\u2019s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonably be consulted, then, as permitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, the subject\u2019s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained.  If the study subject does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record why the subject did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the subject\u2019s legally acceptable representative, the consent signer\u2019s relationship to the study subject (eg, parent, spouse), and that the subject\u2019s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally it must be documented in the source documents.If the study includes minor subjects who reach the age of majority during the study, as recognized under local law, they must re-consent as adults to remain in the study.  If the enrollment of \u2018emancipated minors\u2019 is permitted by the study age criteria, the IRB/EC, and local law, they must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the permission of a parent or legal guardian.The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject's legally acceptable representative, parent(s) or legal guardian and the subject\u2019s assent, when applicable, before any study-specific activity is performed.  The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent/assent document.",
