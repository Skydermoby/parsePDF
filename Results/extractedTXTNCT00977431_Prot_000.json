                "Content": " Approximately 42,000 new cases of primary brain tumours are diagnosed annually in the US, EU-5 and Japan. Malignant gliomas are the most common type. Malignant gliomas comprises WHO grade IV tumours, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; ~ 55% of all brain tumours) and WHO grade III tumours (e.g. anaplastic astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma). Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent malignant glioma and is associated with a particularly aggressive course and poor prognosis. Little improvement in overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) has been achieved in the past 20 years. Surgical resection and radiotherapy have been the mainstay of treatment; only recently the benefits of chemotherapy have been shown in a randomised trial testing the combination of temozolomide (TMZ) with radiotherapy followed by maintenance (adjuvant) TMZ against radiotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Based on demonstrated improved OS, TMZ plus radiotherapy followed by TMZ maintenance therapy is considered standard treatment for newly diagnosed GBM (R08-1056). There are several reasons for the poor response of GBM. First, tumour cells extensively infiltrate the surrounding brain parenchyma, thereby limiting the overall utility of surgical resection. Second, the blood-brain barrier is an obstacle to the adequate delivery of chemotherapy agents for brain tumours, particularly the infiltrating component of tumour where the malignant cells are intercalated in the normal brain parenchyma. Only small and lipophilic molecules are able to cross the intact blood-brain barrier to reach these deep-sitting tumour cells. Although contrast enhancement on imaging studies does indicate a partial disruption of the blood-brain barrier, this represents only a part of these diffusely infiltrating tumours. Third, GBM is refractory to most cancer cytotoxic agents, and occasional responses are short-lived with development of resistance, a direct consequence of genetic transformation and tumour heterogeneity characteristic of this neoplasm. Patients with glioblastoma and malignant gliomas with a methylated promoter of the MGMT-DNA-repair gene have a better survival and progression-free survival than patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter who express high levels of this DNA-repair enzyme compromising the therapeutic effect of TMZ (R08-5066). Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that EGFR activation may contribute to radiation resistance (R09-0092, R09-0099, R09-0094, R09-0097) and that EGFR-mediated radiation resistance can be abrogated by inhibiting EGFR (R09-0183, R09-0093). Several types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been reported in GBMs, and in nearly all cases the alterations have been reported in tumours with EGFR amplification (R08-1064). Although mutations in the EGFR kinase regions have not been detected in malignant glioma as they have in some subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer, (R08-1064, R08-1063, R06-1645), about 40% of tumours with EGFR amplification express the mutant receptor EGFRvIII (R06-1645). The EGFRvIII mutation represents an in-frame Boehringer Ingelheim Page 18 of 91 BI Trial No.: 1200.38                Trial Protocol Revision E                     <c17151786-01> Proprietary confidential information \u00a9 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies    deletion of exons 2-7 from the EGFR extracellular domain that causes a defect in the extracellular ligand binding domain and constitutive activation in a ligand-independent manner. A recent analysis of 649 cases of GBMs revealed that EGFRvIII positivity is an independent prognostic factor for poor survival (R06-1645) and may provide a rationale for the clinical development of BIBW 2992 in GBM. Thus, EGFR plays a major role in the pathogenesis of malignant glioma and provides rational development of EGFR targeted therapies. ",

                        "Content": " BIBW 2992 is a highly selective and potent low molecular weight, irreversible inhibitor of the erbB-family of tyrosine kinase receptors EGFR (erbB1 / HER1) and HER 2 (erbB2). All references in this protocol concerning BIBW 2992 refer to the free base compound BIBW 2992 BS which is used as the oral formulation (U03-3218).  The potency of BIBW 2992 was determined in enzymatic assays using recombinant human wild-type EGFR (IC50 0.5 nM) and HER2 (IC50 14 nm) (U03-3218). A panel of recombinant human kinases tested in parallel was not inhibited, demonstrating the high target specificity of BIBW 2992 (U03-3218). Molecular modeling revealed that BIBW 2992 binds covalently and with high affinity to Cys773 within the catalytic cleft of the ATP-binding pocket of the EGF receptor. It has been reported that this specific molecular interaction results in irreversible inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (R02-2292). Experimental data from in vitro washout studies confirmed the irreversible binding of BIBW 2992 to its molecular target. In constitutively EGFR-overexpressing A431 human epidermoid cancer cells, BIBW 2992 inhibition of EGFR-signaling lasted for up to 7 hours after removal of the compound from the cell cultures (U03-3218). In contrast, A431 cells exposed to reversible EGFR TKIs regained full receptor function almost immediately after inhibitor washout. The efficacy and potency of BIBW 2992 was demonstrated in vitro in receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation assays in various human cancer cell models (P06-08275, U07-1338-01). The specific activity of BIBW 2992 was determined in two independent in vitro assay systems: i) EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation using immunoprecipitation and Western blot and ii) clonogenic, anchorage-independent cell growth in a soft-agar assay system (P06-08275). The in vivo activity of BIBW 2992 against EGFR was investigated in an A431 subcutaneous xenograft model (U03-3218). Daily oral treatment with BIBW 2992 at doses of 20 mg/kg resulted in an almost complete inhibition of tumour growth over a period of 25 days. Similar anti-tumour activity was observed in NCI-N87 tumour bearing mice treated with BIBW 2992 at similar concentrations. In these in vivo studies, BIBW 2992 plasma concentrations of 80-285 nM corresponding to an AUC0-24 of 589-3198 nM*h were required for anti-tumour Boehringer Ingelheim \nPage 19 of 91 \nBI Trial No.: 1200.38                Trial Protocol Revision E                     <c17151786-01> \nProprietary confidential information \u00a9 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies \n \n \n \nactivity. All BIBW 2992 doses shown to be effective in mouse xenograft models were well \ntolerated. \nLimitations imposed by the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) may have an impact on the clinical \nactivity of EGFR TKIs. BIBW 2992 does not cross the BBB in healthy rats (U03-1562). It \ncan be assumed that due to the disrupted BBB in human GBMs BIBW 2992 might reach the \ncontrast-agent enhancing part of the tumor. Also, brain metastases in some patients with \nNSCLC have responded to treatment with BIBW 2992. \nBIBW 2992 is a potent, irreversible, orally available EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor \ndisplaying significant anti-tumour activity in a once daily dosing schedule. It did not show \nrelevant inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, but BIBW 2992 is a CYP3A4 substrate \n(U05-1723-01), although this metabolic pathway is not the dominant one. Drug-drug \ninteractions with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors are not expected. \nBIBW 2992 is a substrate of the P-gp transporter. Concomitant administration of the potent \nP-gp inhibitor ritonavir did not relevantly change the exposure to 40 mg BIBW 2992  when \ntaken simultaneously with or 6 h after BIBW 2992  but increased the bioavailability of BIBW \n2992  (single dose of 20 mg) by 48% and 39% for AUC0-\u221e and Cmax when given 1 h before \nBIBW 2992, respectively. Pretreatment with the potent P-gp inducer rifampicin decreased the \nplasma exposure of 40 mg BIBW 2992 by 34 % BIBW 2992 (AUC0-\u221e) and 22 % (Cmax), \nrespectively. Caution should be exercised when combining BIBW 2992 with potent P-gp \nmodulators. \n \nPreclinical Pharmacology and toxicology profile \nThe absolute bioavailability of BIBW 2992 after oral ingestion is 45% in rats with a median \ntmax reached after 4 hours and a terminal half-life (t1/2) of 4.5 hours. In rats the exposure was \ndose proportional and no gender-related effects or compound accumulation was observed. \nBIBW 2992 is primarily excreted via the faeces. No relevant inhibition of cytochrome P450 \nisoenzymes was found. BIBW 2992 is however a CYP3A4 substrate (U05-1723-01). Since \nthis is not considered a dominant metabolic pathway, in vitro drug-drug interactions with \nCYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors are not expected (U03-3218). \nIn vivo BIBW 2992 was metabolised only to a minor extent and the metabolism was \ngoverned by adduct formation to proteins or nucleophilic small molecules. It was found that \nmetabolism is of subordinate role for BIBW 2992 and that enzyme-catalyzed metabolic \nreactions play a negligible role for the metabolism of BIBW 2992 in vivo. Only approx. 2 % \nof the dose were metabolised by FMO3 in vivo. The CYP3A4-dependent N-demethylation \nwas even too low to be quantitatively detected in human volunteers (U07-1737, U06-2055-\n01, U07-1296-01). Therefore, intrinsic (e.g. genetic predisposition) or extrinsic (e.g. by \ncomedications) effects on the activity of FMO3 or CYP3A4 in vivo are expected to be of \nlittle, if any, relevance for the pharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992. \nBoehringer Ingelheim \nPage 20 of 91 \nBI Trial No.: 1200.38                Trial Protocol Revision E                     <c17151786-01> \nProprietary confidential information \u00a9 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies \n \n \n \nThe human ADME data confirmed the results of the preclinical [14C] ADME studies and all \nmetabolites of the human [14C] ADME study were observed in the rat or the minipig (see \nU04-1028 and U06-1093), respectively). \nIn acute toxicology studies, oral administration of single doses in rats and mice indicated a \nlow acute toxic potential of BIBW 2992. Changes in renal and hepatic function occurred only \nat doses that were 10-30 fold above the levels required for antitumour activity. BIBW 2992 \nhad effects on gastrointestinal function that were dose-dependent and in high doses, leading \nto profound inhibition. No acute toxic effects on the central nervous system were detected. \nIn oral repeated dose studies for up to 26 weeks in rats and minipigs, the main target organs \nwere the gastrointestinal tract (rats and minipigs), kidneys (rat), and the skin (rats). In the \ngastrointestinal tract, increasing systemic exposure was associated with dose-dependent \natrophy of the epithelium and concomitant focal erosions/ulcerations in the stomach of rats \nand minipigs. Clinically this resulted in diarrhoea in both species and faecal occult blood in a \nsingle minipig. In rat kidneys papillary necrosis and dilated tubules were found. Similar \npathologic findings, i.e., papillary necrosis in rats and dogs have been described previously \nfor the EGFR-small molecule inhibitor gefitinib. However, nephrotoxicity has not been \nreported as a side-effect of gefitinib therapy in humans. A secondary pathophysiologic effect \non renal function in BIBW 2992-treated animals due to diarrhoea-induced dehydration and \nemaciation has to also be considered. \nCutaneous alterations, i.e., epithelial atrophy were observed in rats. However, BIBW 2992 is \nnot irritating to intact skin in albino rabbits and the effects observed in rats are most likely \nrelated to the specific pharmacodynamic mechanism of EGFR-inhibition (U03-3218). \nA variety of organs including the aerodigestive tract and reproductive organs were affected \nby epithelial atrophy. These atrophic changes were not severe and fully reversed during a 2-\nweek recovery period. \nMinor cardiovascular effects (increased blood pressure and heart rate) and a dose-dependent \ndecrease of QT time in the electrocardiogram (ECG) occurred in BIBW 2992-treated \nminipigs. These data do not indicate a risk for QT-prolongation related arrhythmia. BIBW \n2992 had no pro-arrhythmic potential, as determined by the effects on HERG-mediated \npotassium current or on guinea pig papillary muscle action potential configuration. \nBIBW 2992 demonstrated mutagenic potential in bacteria but had no genotoxic potential in \nvivo even at highly toxic/lethal doses in animals. Because of its specific pharmacodynamic \nmechanism of action, BIBW 2992 is potentially embryo/foetotoxic and/or teratogenic. \nPreclinical GBM related pharmacology experiments \nAlthough BIBW 2992 did not sensitize head and neck cancer cells (FaDu) to radiotherapy in \nvitro, in a FaDu xenograft model the anti-tumour activity of a single 20 Gy irradiation dose \nwas significantly improved by subsequent daily BIBW 2992 treatment (U04-2147). \nTherefore, the available preclinical data support further studies in combining BIBW 2992 \nwith radiation therapy. \nBoehringer Ingelheim \nPage 21 of 91 \nBI Trial No.: 1200.38                Trial Protocol Revision E                     <c17151786-01> \nProprietary confidential information \u00a9 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies \n \n \n \nIn transfected cell lines, the EGFRvIII mutation confers a high level of resistance to \nreversible receptor kinase inhibitors such (first generation TKIs) such as gefitinib and \nerlotinib in contrast to irreversible inhibitors like HKI-272 and BIBW 2992, with the latter \nbeing the most potent compound in these cell lines. This might explain at least in part why \nreversible TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib have shown only modest activity when \ninvestigated in several studies in recurrent (R09-0277, R09-0095 R09-0524, R09-0525) or \nnewly diagnosed malignant glioma (R09-0184). \nThe above studies also demonstrated that dose escalations of gefitinib and erlotinib were \nnecessary in patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs), frequently used in \npatients with malignant gliomas. These compounds (EIAEDs) are known to profoundly \ndiminish exposures to several molecular targeting cancer therapeutics as well as \nchemotherapeutics. In contrast, the metabolism of BIBW 2992 is not expected to be affected \nby concurrent administration of cytochrom P450-enzyme-inducing medications. Thus, it is \nexpected that patients treated with BIBW 2992 will have more consistent drug exposure of \nthe tumour compared to other EGFR inhibitors for GBM patients, regardless of concurrent \nanti-epileptic agent administration. \nBIBW 2992 Phase I and Phase II trial program \nNine Phase I open-label trials are completed or ongoing with BIBW 2992 including a roll-\nover trial. As of September 2008, 439 patients with advanced solid tumours have been \nexposed to BIBW 2992 alone or in combination with docetaxel or paclitaxel in these trials \nwith doses ranging from 10mg to 160mg daily.  \nBIBW 2992 showed moderately fast absorption with median tmax values between 1 h to 6 h \nafter administration. The gMean terminal half-life (t1/2) of BIBW 2992 mainly ranged \nbetween 13 h to 57 h. In general, the maximum blood concentration (Cmax) and the integral of \nthe concentration time curve (AUC) of BIBW 2992 increased in a dose-proportional way \n(U03-3218). BIBW 2992 displayed a food effect with a decreased systemic exposure in the \nfed state compared to administration of BIBW 2992 under fasted conditions. Steady state was \nreached within 8 days after the first administration. \nCurrently, a combined phase I/II study (1200.36 study) in patients with recurrent GBM is \nconducted in the US. The study determines the MTD and pharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992 \nadministered in combination with TMZ (phase I part). In the phase II part of the study the \nefficacy and safety of BIBW 2992 monotherapy and BIBW 2992 / TMZ combination therapy \ncompared to TMZ monotherapy (three treatment arms) is estimated. Data from the phase I \npart of this trial indicate that 40mg of BIBW 2992 in combination with TMZ is well \ntolerated. \nThe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIBW 2992 was identified as 50mg once daily in \nphase I continuous dosing monotherapy trials. \nThe Adverse Events (AEs) observed to date in Phase I and Phase II trials are consistent with \nthose reported for other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dose dependent diarrhoea and skin-\nrelated adverse events including rash and acne). Other AEs were in the expected range for \nBoehringer Ingelheim Page 22 of 91 BI Trial No.: 1200.38                Trial Protocol Revision E                     <c17151786-01> Proprietary confidential information \u00a9 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies    patients with advanced cancer disease (U03-3218). In the BIBW 2992 Phase I monotherapy trials, the most frequent drug-related adverse events were associated with gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (rash, dry skin, pruritus, acneiform rash, and acne), general disorders and administration site conditions (fatigue, mucosal inflammation), respiratory disorders (epistaxis), and metabolism and nutritional disorders (anorexia, dehydration). Diarrhoea is the single most often reported gastrointestinal AE. An increased incidence of diarrhoea grade 3 (22.4%) has been observed in phase II monotherapy trials (starting dose of 50 mg qd). Prompt and proactive management of diarrhoea together with timely treatment pause and dose reduction is crucial to reduce the severity of diarrhoea and its potential complications such as dehydration leading to serum electrolyte changes (hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia) and/or renal impairment.  Nausea and vomiting are the other commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events and can be generally managed successfully with the use of antiemetics.   Skin related adverse events present in a number of forms, i.e., rash (including erythematous, maculo-papular, papular, etc.), acne, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, skin reaction and pruritis. Folliculitis as well as nail changes (including paronychia) are other reported manifestations of skin-related adverse events with BIBW 2992. Early and adequate management of skin-related adverse events can reduce the frequency and the severity of them (R07-4077). ",

                        "Content": " Temozolomide (TMZ) is an orally administered, second generation imidazotetrazine prodrug with essentially 100% oral bioavailability. TMZ spontaneously converts to the active alkylating agent 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4- carboximide (MTIC) with extensive tissue distribution, including penetration of the blood\u2013brain barrier and the cerebrospinal fluid. TMZ has notable antitumour activity against recurrent GBM (R08-1057), recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma, and advanced malignant melanoma, and other refractory cancers. TMZ has shown activity when added to radiotherapy for treatment of newly diagnosed GBM (R08-1056).   TMZ is rapidly absorbed and spontaneously converts to the active metabolite MTIC. Maximum plasma concentrations are observed 30 to 90 minutes after oral intake, and the plasma half-life is approximately 2 hours, with some delayed absorption when taken with food. Pharmacokinetics in the CSF compared with plasma showed an AUC of approximately 20% of the AUC. Patients usually tolerate TMZ well; mild to moderate adverse effects are nausea and vomiting that are usually easily controlled with standard antiemetic drugs, constipation, and some fatigue. The most serious and dose-limiting toxicity, observed in less than 10% of patients, is noncumulative myelosuppression, particularly thrombocytopenia occurring 3 to 4 weeks after treatment start,  TMZ is indicated for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy and subsequently as monotherapy treatment. TMZ is also Boehringer Ingelheim Page 23 of 91 BI Trial No.: 1200.38                Trial Protocol Revision E                     <c17151786-01> Proprietary confidential information \u00a9 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies    indicated for treatment of malignant glioma, showing recurrence or progression after standard therapy. In the concomitant phase TMZ is administered orally at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy (60 Gy administered in 30 fractions) without dose reductions, but delay or discontinuation of TMZ can be considered weekly according to haematological and non-haematological side effect criteria. The TMZ is usually continued throughout the 42 day concomitant period (up to 49 days) in absence of adverse reaction.  Four weeks after completing the TMZ + Radiotherapy phase, TMZ is administered for up to 6 cycles of monotherapy treatment. The dose in cycle 1 (monotherapy) is 150 mg/m2 once daily for 5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, the dose is escalated to 200 mg/m2 in absence of side effects. In this study, patients are stratified according to the methylation status of the MGMT promoter: patients with unmethylated MGMT status will received BIBW 2992 only and patients with methylated MGMT status will received BIBW 2992 and TMZ, both in combination with radiotherapy. The rationale for this design is based on an increasing body of evidence that patients with an unmethylated MGMT promotor only marginally if at all benefit from the addition of TMZ to standard radiotherapy (R08-5066, R08-5067, R08-5252, R08-5253, R08-5254, R08-5255, R08-5256, R08-5429). Moreover, an international group of investigators from the US, Canada, and Europe is collaborating on trial RTOG 0525 in which both clinical and molecular markers are being used to prospectively assess MGMTpromoter methylation status. This trial results are expected to validate MGMT promoter methylation as a molecular marker of response and/or prognosis. The trial accrued 1,153 patients and results are expected in about 1.5 years. In 2005 Hegi et al showed an advantage regarding Progression Free Survival for treatment with TMZ in addition to RT only for patients whose tumours had a methylated MGMT promoter (R08-5067). However, results of the 5-year OS analysis of the EORTC-NCIC trial comparing RT with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ versus RT alone showed some survival benefit for patients treated with TMZ and RT regardless of the methylation status of their tumours. In a subgroup of 60 patients with unmethylated MGMT the median Overall Survival was 12.6 months in the combined treatment arm versus 11.8 months in the RT only arm [HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-8 (R10-6416). While the study was not powered to show significant interaction between treatment and MGMT-status and the finding is based only on a few patients who were alive after more than 2 years, it suggests that at least no detrimental effect of combined treatment with TMZ and RT is to be expected in patients with unmethylated tumours. In view of these data, once the MTD of BIBW2992 in combination with Radiotherapy will be determined in patients with unmethylated MGMT status, patients with unmethylated MGMT status will be able to enter in the BIBW 2992 and TMZ in combination with radiotherapy group.

                "Content": " The rationale of adding BIBW 2992 to standard radiotherapy (with or without TMZ, depending on the methylation status of the MGMT promotor) is based on findings that the tyrosine kinase EGFR has been implicated in supporting oncogenesis and progression of human solid tumours and is a promising target for anticancer therapy. EGFR is amplified in approximately 50% of GBMs (R08-1064) and is overexpressed in over 60% of malignant gliomas independent of amplification status (R08-1063). Because of the redundancy of the EGFR signaling pathway but also because of expected additive effects, combining BIBW 2992 with standard radiotherapy and alkylating agents like TMZ might result in complementary action and be superior compared to the single agent therapeutic approach in newly diagnosed malignant glioma. TMZ as the chemotherapeutic agent to be combined with BIBW 2992 is expected to show additive activity, complimentary mechanisms of action, non-overlapping toxicities, and a lack of PK interaction. Both, the preclinical profile of BIBW 2992 (superior efficacy in tumour cell lines harboring the EGFRvIII mutation compared to gefitinib and erlotinib, irreversible mode of action) and the clinical profile of this compound (efficacy in EGFR-driven tumours and favorable safety profile) supports this Phase I/II exploratory approach in GBM.

                "Content": " The outcome for patients diagnosed with GBM is poor, with a median overall survival of only little more than a year. In the past tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to target the molecular pathways involved in tumour growth. There is evidence that these agents are effective in GBM and particularly in the subgroup of patients whose tumours harbour mutations like EGFRvIII. The currently available preclinical data indicate that BIBW 2992 has a potency which is potentially superior to reversible EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib) (P08-06904).  Since the adverse reaction profile of TMZ is different from BIBW 2992, significant overlapping side effects are not expected. In a phase I/II trial of erlotinib and TMZ with RT in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM no cumulative effect between RT and the EGFR inhibitor have been reported (R09-0184). The most common side effects with BIBW 2992 are expected to be primarily gastrointestinal (including diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and anorexia) as well as fatigue and rash. Proactive management of these common side effects and the proposed dose reduction scheme will ensure that the proposed regimen is well tolerated. Although skin and gastrointestinal adverse events are common with BIBW 2992, they are rarely serious and almost always reversible.

Although rare, drug-induced liver injury is under constant surveillance by sponsors and regulators and is considered a protocol-specified significant adverse event.  Timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to distinguish an effect of the underlying malignancy on liver function from other causes are important for patient safety.  The following are considered as Protocol-specified significant events:    Hepatic injury defined by the following alterations of liver parameters:     o For patients with normal liver function (ALT, AST and bilirubin within normal limits) at baseline an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample. Patients showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to APPENDIX 10.8 of this clinical trial protocol and the \"DILI checklist\" provided in the ISF    o For patients with abnormal liver function at baseline an elevation of AST and/or ALT >5 fold ULN combined with an elevation of bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample. Patients showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to APPENDIX 10.8 of this clinical trial protocol and the \"DILI checklist\" provided in the ISF.         Protocol-specified significant events are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to Serious Adverse Events, even if they do not meet any of the seriousness criteria - for details please see chapter 8.4.1.  If the investigator determines any protocol-specific significant event is related to study drug, the administration of the study drug must be managed according to section 4.1.4.1.2 of the protocol.

Objectives of this analysis will be: \u2022 To determine the MTD for each regimen (Regimen M and Regimen U); \u2022 To recommend the optimal dose of BIBW 2992 to investigate in future studies.  This analysis will therefore summarise incidence of DLT, for MTD determination. The analysis will also report safety observations collected beyond the concomitant treatment period where feasible, to facilitate selection of the optimal dose.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, requires or prolongs patient hospitalisation, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. BI has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be always serious. In order to support the investigator with the identification of these \u201calways serious adverse events\u201d, if a non serious AE is identified to be serious per BI definition, a query will be raised. The investigator must verify the description and seriousness of the event.  If the event description is correct, the item \u201cserious\u201d needs to be ticked and an SAE has to be reported in expedited fashion following the same procedure as above.

All \nfields should be treated daily. QA checks of delivery with on treatment imaging should be \ncarried out according to local practice. \nDose limits \nThe planning priority is to treat CTV and a minimum of 1cm margin to the prescribed dose. It \nis suggested that dose to critical structures such as the brain stem and the optic apparatus is \nkept below 55Gy although this should not be at the expense of CTV coverage. Peripheral \nportion of PTV may be adjusted to achieve normal tissue sparing. Scalp sparing techniques to \navoid permanent hair loss should be used as is standard practice in the department but they \nmust not compromise on a minimum 1cm CTV-PTV margin. \nRadiotherapy schedule \nRadiotherapy should be given as fractionated treatment, delivering a total dose of 60 Gy in 6 \nweeks specified at 100%, given as a once daily schedule of 2 Gy per fraction, for a total of 30 \nfractions.  All fields should be treated daily.  \nDelays in Radiotherapy \nDelays should be avoided if at all possible. There is a potential risk of bleeding in patients \nwith low platelets, and if a platelet count < 25 x 109/l is recorded, radiotherapy should be \ndelayed until the platelets have recovered to > 50 x 109/l.   \nMedical management during radiotherapy \nCortisosteroids should not be prescribed routinely for patients during radiotherapy.  However \nin patients with raised intracranial pressure and/or progressive  neurological deficit \nresponsive to steroids, they can be prescribed at the discretion of the clinical team.  The aim \nshould be to titrate the dose to the lowest necessary to control the problems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoehringer Ingelheim Page 89 of 91 BI Trial No.: 1200.38                Trial Protocol Revision E                     <c17151786-01> Proprietary confidential information \u00a9 2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies    ",

If the alert is confirmed on initial sample, or it is not possible to repeat testing using intial sample, the following must be completed; 1) Evaluate the patient within 48 hours and,   2) Perform the following laboratory tests: 1. Repeat  of AST, ALT, bilirubin (with fractionation to total and direct)  2. Haptoglobin 3. Complete blood count and cell morphology 4. Reticulocyte count 5.  Creatinine Kinase (CK) 6.

If the initial alert values (i.e. AST,ALT, and bilirubin) are confirmed on the second sample described as above, then an abdominal ultrasound or clinically appropriate alternate imaging  (to rule out biliary tract, pancreatic or intrahepatic pathology, e.g. bile duct stones or neoplasm) must be completed within 48 hours   The findings from the hepatic imaging (including comparison to prior imaging if available) must be made available as soon as possible as part of the adverse event reporting process.  In the event the etiology of the abnormal liver tests results is not identified based on the imaging (e.g. biliary tract, pancreatic or intrahepatic pathology), then the \u201cDILI checklist\u201d must be completed.
