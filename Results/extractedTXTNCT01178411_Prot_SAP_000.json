                                "Content": " Tivantinib is the most advanced representative of a newly discovered class of trans 3,4 disubstituted pyrrolidine-2,5-diones having the potential to treat cancer.1  Tivantinib is a novel, small molecule inhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase. The expression of c-MET is dysregulated in many types of human malignancies with overexpression of c-MET kinase, c-MET-activating genetic mutations, c-MET amplifications, and increased expression of the c-MET ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). This dysregulation is implicated with a poor prognosis with greater tumor proliferation and increased angiogenesis with migration and invasion.2,3 The c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase is the only known high-affinity receptor for HGF, also known as scatter factor. The binding of HGF to the c-MET extracellular ligand-binding domain results in receptor multimerization and phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the intracellular portion of c-MET.4,5 Activation of c-MET results in the binding and phosphorylation of adaptor proteins such as growth factor receptor-bound-associated binder-1 (Gab-1), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb-2), Src homology 2 domain-containing and Casitas B-lineage lymphoma progene (c-Cbl), and subsequent activation of signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/activated protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK), signal transducers and activators of transcription protein (STAT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK (Ras/MEK/Erk) pathways. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor and HGF are expressed in numerous tissues and their expression is normally confined predominantly to cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin, respectively.6,7 Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor and HGF are deregulated in human cancers and may contribute to dysregulation of cell growth, tumor cell dissemination, and tumor invasion during disease progression and metastasis. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor and HGF are highly expressed relative to surrounding tissue in numerous cancers, and this expression correlates with poor subject prognosis.8,9,10,11 Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor and HGF may protect tumors against cell death induced by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents and, as such, may contribute to chemoresistance and radioresistance of tumors. Therefore, inhibitors of c-MET may be useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of proliferative disorders. Tivantinib selectively inhibits the inactive or unphosphorylated form of human c-MET and shows in vitro biochemical activity against recombinant c-MET with an inhibition constant (Ki) of approximately 355 nM. The potency of tivantinib inhibition of c-MET activity is independent of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, which suggests that tivantinib\u2019s inhibition is of noncompetitive nature. Tivantinib was profiled against 230 protein kinases, and while tivantinib inhibits c-MET kinase activity, it is not a promiscuous kinase inhibitor. In nonclinical studies, tivantinib showed broad-spectrum in vitro anti-cancer activity against human tumor cell lines, including breast, colon, lung, pancreas, and gastric cancer cell lines. The potency of tivantinib in cancer cells expressing detectable c-MET in anti-proliferative assays yield IC50 values from 0.1 mM to 0.6 mM. The ability of tivantinib to inhibit c-MET phosphorylation correlated with its ability to inhibit growth in c-MET expressing cancer cells, thereby indicating its anti-cancer activity. In single-agent in vivo studies, tivantinib was ArQule, Inc.  18 February 2014 ARQ 197-299 Amendment 2  Confidential Page 10 of 66 shown to be efficacious against multiple human cancer xenograft models and was well tolerated without drug-related clinical signs or deaths. The tivantinib development program is predicated on the hypothesis that tivantinib-mediated inhibition of the c-MET pathway, either alone or in combination with other anti-cancer compounds, will be beneficial in treating malignancies.  Detailed information of the nonclinical and clinical studies is provided in the tivantinib Investigator\u2019s Brochure (IB).12  ",

A Phase 3 study in subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is ongoing (ARQ 197-A-U303). Completed and ongoing studies have included subjects with colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, HCC, microphthalmia transcription factor associated tumors, non-central nervous system germ cell tumors, NSCLC, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Approximately 127 healthy subjects have received tivantinib in completed Phase 1 studies.  Another 2691 subjects with cancer have been randomized in ongoing or completed Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies of tivantinib. Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies demonstrated early clinical activity of tivantinib as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents (including erlotinib, sorafenib, gemcitabine, irinotecan, and cetuximab).  In all studies, subjects have been treated with assigned therapy until unacceptable toxicity, documented progression of disease, or another criterion for discontinuation has been met.  Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of tivantinib have been conducted in 14 Phase 1 studies that include 127 healthy subjects and 426 subjects with cancer. In general, AUC and Cmax increased with an increasing dose of tivantinib, although this increase was not dose proportional.  Following human oral administration with a meal, tivantinib is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. The drug is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 isozymes with no parent compound being detected in the urine and only traces of parent compound being detected in the feces. Tivantinib exposure is affected by the following factors: CYP2C19 genotype, history of hepatocellular carcinoma, coadministration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor, dosage form (i.e., crystalline vs. amorphous), formulation (capsule vs. tablet), and fed status during tivantinib administration.

The majority of drug-related adverse events (AEs) have been mild to moderate with manageable toxicities.  ArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 11 of 66 \nMyelosuppression \nMyelosuppression (including anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, \nleukopenia, pancytopenia, and neutropenic sepsis) has been reported in single agent and \ncombination therapy clinical studies of tivantinib.  There have been fatal outcomes for some \nneutropenic events. Complete blood count should be performed as advised in the protocols.  \nCaution is advised when any CYP2C19 inhibitors and/or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are used \nas concomitant therapy, and in subjects with known CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status. Dose \nmodifications were made in the HCC studies because of higher incidences of neutropenia and \nfebrile neutropenia, which were associated with higher drug levels in these subjects.  \nSubjects who experience severe myelosuppression including neutropenia should be \nmonitored more closely throughout the study, and dose modifications or interruptions should \nbe made as specified in the original protocols. For subjects with severe neutropenia, febrile \nneutropenia, or neutropenic sepsis, supportive care, including use of haematopoietic growth \nfactors and antibiotics should be considered. \nBradycardia \nBradycardia has been reported in single agent and combination therapy clinical studies of \ntivantinib. In general, bradycardia was most commonly reported as a nonserious adverse \nevent. Most of these events were mild to moderate in severity (Grade 1\u20132.) Most subjects \nwere asymptomatic and recovered without additional therapy, though the bradycardic effect \nmay be prolonged. However, cases of bradycardia requiring hospitalization have been \nreported, and some subjects received placement of permanent pacemakers. \nSubjects who appear to be at a greater risk for severe bradycardia are those with pre-existing \nbradycardia or sick sinus syndrome or those patients receiving beta-blocker therapy. In these \npatients, tivantinib should be used with caution. \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended prior to initiation of tivantinib therapy \nand is to be repeated at any visit when a subject has a heart rate \u226450 beats per minute (bpm), \nor as clinically indicated. In general, heart rate and ECG should be monitored as specified in \nthe original protocol, and dose reduction should be considered for subjects with persistent \nbradycardia and symptomatic hypotension.     \nInterstitial Lung Disease \nThere have been reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or similar events in subjects \nenrolled in tivantinib studies. The reported events included ILD, pneumonitis, acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and diffuse alveolar damage.  \nIn the majority of the reports, tivantinib was given in combination with agents with known \nassociation with ILD, including erlotinib and gemcitabine. An association of tivantinib and \nILD has not been established. However, it is recommended to investigate the cause for a \nmarked increase in respiratory symptoms in subjects participating in tivantinib studies, \nparticularly in Asian patients. \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 12 of 66 \nMONOTHERAPY STUDIES \nARQ 197-101 \nARQ 197-101 was an open-label study of tivantinib in subjects with metastatic solid tumors, \nincluding renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and other c-MET-expressing tumors, that were \nrefractory to available systemic therapies or for whom no standard effective systemic therapy \nexisted. A total of 79 subjects were enrolled and treated in this study.  The most common \nreasons for discontinuing treatment were disease progression (59.5%), symptomatic \ndeterioration without evidence of progression (19.0%), and subject request (10.1%). The \nmost common (\u2265 10%) AEs were fatigue (40.5%), nausea and vomiting (27.8% each), \nanemia/hemoglobin decreased (24.0%), and diarrhea (21.5%). One subject had an AE \n(neutropenia) that led to a dose reduction, which was considered drug-related. A total of \n28 of 79 (35.4%) subjects reported serious adverse events (SAEs).  The most common SAEs \nwere disease progression and dehydration, each experienced by 5 (6.3%) subjects. There \nwere eight deaths within 30 days of the last dose of study drugs; five of the deaths resulted \nfrom disease progression.  The other deaths, one each, were due to the following: cardio-\npulmonary arrest, pancytopenia, and respiratory failure. \nARQ 197-103 \nARQ 197-103 was an open-label study of tivantinib in subjects with advanced solid tumors \nwho were refractory to available therapy or for whom no standard effective systemic therapy \nexisted, including subjects with advanced prostate cancer. A total of 51 subjects were \nenrolled and treated in this study.  The most common reasons for discontinuing treatment \nwere progressive disease (74.5%), AE (13.7%), and symptomatic deterioration without \nevidence of progression (5.9%). The most common AEs were fatigue (49.0%), nausea \n(29.4%), anemia (27.5%), vomiting (25.5%), anorexia and constipation (23.5% each), and \nback pain and weight decreased (21.6% each). Seven (13.7%) subjects experienced AEs that \nled to treatment discontinuation. Two subjects discontinued treatment due to \nhyperbilirubinaemia and one subject each discontinued treatment due to chest infection, \ninfection, fatigue, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, febrile neutropenia, and \nnausea. Serious adverse events were reported in 22 (43.1%) subjects.  Serious adverse events \nreported at a \u2265 5% incidence (more than one subject) were febrile neutropenia (5.9%) and \ndisease progression (9.8%). There were five deaths during treatment or within 30 days of the \nlast dose of study drug.  All deaths were due to disease progression and were judged to be not \nrelated to study drug. \nARQ 197-114 \nARQ 197-114 was an open-label study of tivantinib in cirrhotic subjects with HCC who had \nreceived not more than two prior systemic regimens. A total of 21 subjects were enrolled and \ntreated in this study. The most common reasons for discontinuing treatment were progressive \ndisease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (61.9%), clinically \nunacceptable toxicities (19.0%), and clinical disease progression (9.5%). The most common \nAEs were asthenia and neutropenia (57.1% each), anemia (52.4%), anorexia (47.6%), \nleukopenia (38.1%), and fatigue, edema peripheral, and diarrhea (33.3% each). In this study, \nAEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 4 of 21 (19.0%) subjects and all were considered \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 13 of 66 \nto be drug-related.  One subject had a dose reduction due to neutropenia and anemia. A \nsecond subject had dose reduction due to bradycardia and dyspnea. A third subject had dose \nreduction due to anemia. The fourth subject had a dose reduction due to asthenia. Serious \nadverse events reported for more than one subject were neutropenia (three subjects), and \nanemia, leukopenia, and disease progression (two subjects each). Five subjects died during \ntreatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. The cause of death in one subject \n(septic shock) was considered related to study drug. Other deaths were considered unrelated \nto study drug and were the result of the following causes: disease progression (two subjects), \nperitoneal hemorrhage (one subject), and pneumonia (one subject). \nARQ 197-A-U157 \nARQ 197-A-U157 was an open-label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-way \ncrossover, relative bioavailability study of a capsule and a tablet formulation of tivantinib in \nsubjects with advanced solid tumors. A total of 26 subjects were enrolled in the study and \n25 (96.2%) completed the 14-day crossover study phase. One subject withdrew from the \n14-day crossover study phase due to disease progression, and 25 (96.2%) subjects continued \nin the extension phase. Bradycardia was reported for 6 of 26 (23.1%) subjects and 6 of \n25 (24.0%) subjects in the cross-over and extension phases, respectively; the majority of the \nevents of bradycardia were considered related to study treatment. Neutropenia was reported \nfor 4 of 25 (16.0%) subjects in the extension phase; 2 subjects had neutropenia that was \nconsidered to be study-drug related. Most of the AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Grade \u22653 \nevents in the extension phase of the study included anemia, neutropenia, pneumonia, failure \nto thrive, haemoptysis, respiratory failure (Grade 5), lactic acidosis, and bone pain, which \nwere experienced by 1 subject (4.0%) each, and Grade \u22653 dyspnoea, experienced by \n2 subjects (8.0%). There were no SAEs reported during the crossover phase of the study. \nDuring the extension phase of the study, four subjects had SAEs considered unrelated to \nstudy treatment and three of these subjects died due to the SAEs, which included progressive \ndisease (fatal), respiratory failure (fatal), and metastatic NSCLC (fatal). None of the deaths \nwere considered related to study treatment. \nARQ 197-0701 \nARQ 197-0701 was an open-label study of tivantinib in Japanese subjects with advanced or \nrecurrent solid tumors who had been classified as extensive metabolizers (EM) or poor \nmetabolizers (PM) based on CYP2C19 genotype, including 25 subjects with NSCLC, and \nwho were refractory to available therapy or for whom no standard therapy existed. A total of \n47 subjects were enrolled and treated in the study. The most common reason for \ndiscontinuing treatment was disease progression (43 subjects). Sixteen SAEs were reported \nin 11 subjects.  Two SAEs were reported more than once: neutrophil count decreased \n(2 subjects) and white blood cell count decreased (2 subjects). No subjects died during the \nstudy or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. \nARQ 197-A-U158 \nARQ 197-A-U158 was a Phase 1, open-label, single-sequence, crossover study to determine \nthe effect of multiple doses of tivantinib on the single-dose PK of omeprazole/S-\nwarfarin/caffeine/midazolam and digoxin when co-administered with tivantinib in cancer \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 14 of 66 \nsubjects. A total of 28 subjects were enrolled into the study. All 28 subjects completed Probe \nReference Treatment and initiated tivantinib.  Twenty-two (78.6%) subjects completed the \nPrimary Objective Phase. Of the six (21.4%) subjects who discontinued from the Primary \nObjective Phase, three (10.7%) discontinued due to an AE, two (7.1%) due to other reasons, \nand one (3.6%) due to progressive disease.  The most commonly reported AEs were fatigue \n(7 [25.0%] subjects), constipation (5 [17.9%] subjects), and vomiting (5 [17.9%] subjects). \nTwenty-four SAEs were reported in 13 subjects.  Disease progression was reported in \n4 subjects, anemia was reported in 3 subjects, and neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and white \nblood cell count decreased were each reported in 2 subjects. No subject died due to an \nadverse event during the Primary Objective Phase of the study or during the Extension Phase. \nThree subjects died after completing the Primary Objective Phase and one subject died \nbefore completing the Primary Objective Phase, all due to disease progression.   \nARQ 197-A-U159 \nARQ 197-A-U159 was a single-blind, single-sequence study assessing the effect of tivantinib \non the QTc interval in subjects with cancer. A total of 38 subjects were enrolled in the study; \n1 subject was discontinued from the study prior to dosing with tivantinib.  The remaining \n37 (97.4%) subjects all completed the Primary Objective Phase.  All of the 37 subjects \nentered the Extension Phase.  Of these, 30 received tivantinib in combination with one or two \nother drugs while 7 continued on tivantinib monotherapy. Adverse events were reported in \n37 (97.4%) subjects during the study. During the Primary Objective Phase, the most \ncommonly (\u2265 5% ) reported AEs occurring after tivantinib dosing were fatigue (6 [16.2%] \nsubjects), nausea (3 [8.1%] subjects), vomiting (2 [5.4%] subjects), and headache (2 [5.4%] \nsubjects). During the Extension Phase, AEs reported by \u2265 10% of subjects included \nneutropenia (11 [29.7%] subjects); nausea, fatigue (9 [24.3%] subjects each); diarrhea \n(8 [21.6%] subjects); constipation, dyspnea (7 [18.9%] subjects each); anemia, dermatitis \nacneiform (6 [16.2%] subjects each); and decreased appetite, tumor pain, and alopecia \n(5 [13.5%] subjects each).  No subject had an SAE during the Primary Objective Phase, and \n4 (10.8%) subjects experienced SAEs during the Extension Phase. No subject was \ndiscontinued due to AEs during any phase of the study. No subject died during the study due \nto an AE.  One subject died during the Extension Phase due to disease progression.   \nARQ 197-004 \nARQ 197-004 was an open-label study of tivantinib in gastric cancer subjects following \ngastrectomy, to determine exposure and progression free survival (PFS) rate in gastric \ncancer. A total of 31 subjects were enrolled and treated in this study. The most common \nreason for discontinuing treatment was progressive disease (27 [87.1%] subjects). The most \ncommon AEs were anorexia (33.3%), nausea (30.0%), alkaline phosphatase increased, \nanemia, and fatigue (each 23.3%), and abdominal pain, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \nincreased, and constipation (each 20.0%). There were no deaths during study treatment or \nwithin 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  \nARQ 197-204 \nARQ 197-204 was an open-label study of tivantinib in subjects 13 years of age or older with \nhistologically or cytologically confirmed MiT tumors (alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear cell \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 15 of 66 \nsarcoma, or translocation associated RCC). A total of 47 subjects were enrolled and treated in \nthe study. The most common reason for discontinuing treatment was disease progression \n(31 [66.0%] subjects discontinued due to progressive disease by RECIST and 7 [14.9%] \nsubjects discontinued due to clinical progression). Of the 47 enrolled subjects, 18 received \ntivantinib 120 mg twice daily (BID) (capsule formulation), 21 received tivantinib 360 mg \nBID (capsule formulation), and 8 initiated treatment with tivantinib 120 mg BID and had \ntheir dose escalated to 360 mg BID. The most common (\u2265 10%) AEs were the following: \nfatigue (66.0%), nausea (51.1%), vomiting (38.3%), anemia (25.5%), cough (25.5%), and \nbradycardia/sinus bradycardia, diarrhea, and headache (21.3% for each). Seven subjects \n(14.9%) experienced neutropenia. Six subjects (12.8%) experienced leukopenia. One \nadditional event of febrile neutropenia was reported as an SAE. In this study, 2 of 47 (4.3%) \nsubjects discontinued treatment due to an AE. One subject in the 360 mg BID treatment \ngroup experienced thrombocytopenia, and one subject in the 120 mg BID treatment group \nexperienced diarrhea, fatigue, headache, and cough. In this study, AEs leading to dose \nreduction (neutropenia, leukopenia, and febrile neutropenia) occurred in 3 of 47 (6.4%) \nsubjects. Disease progression was reported in two subjects during the treatment phase of the \nstudy. Three subjects had SAEs (febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and deep vein \nthrombosis) that were considered possibly related to study treatment; all three of these events \nresolved (the deep vein thrombosis resolved with sequelae). There were two deaths during \nthe study or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. Both deaths resulted from disease \nprogression and were not attributed to study drug. \nARQ 197-205 \nARQ 197-205 was an open-label study comparing tivantinib to gemcitabine in treatment-\nna\u00efve subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. \nA total of 43 subjects were enrolled and randomized in this study and 40 subjects received \nstudy drug. All subjects in the tivantinib group received 120 mg BID (capsule formulation) in \nthe fasted state. The most common reason for discontinuation was progressive disease \n(12 [63.2%] and 13 [61.9%] subjects in the tivantinib and gemcitabine groups, respectively). \nThree subjects (15.8%) and 2 subjects (9.5%) in the tivantinib and gemcitabine groups, \nrespectively, discontinued treatment due to AEs. The most common (\u2265 10%) AEs were \nfatigue (42.1%), edema peripheral, anorexia, and ascites (26.3% for each), and nausea, \nabdominal pain, and blood alkaline phosphatase increased (21.1% for each). Five subjects in \nthe gemcitabine group (23.8%) experienced neutropenia and two subjects in the gemcitabine \ngroup (9.5%) experienced leukopenia.  There were no events of neutropenia or leukopenia in \nthe tivantinib group. There were no events of bradycardia reported in this study. There were \n13 subjects (32.5%), 5 (26.3%) in the tivantinib treatment arm and 8 (38.1%) in the \ngemcitabine treatment arm, who discontinued treatment due to an AE. Adverse events \nleading to treatment discontinuation in the tivantinib arm included ascites (2 subjects), \nvomiting (1 subject), malignant neoplasm progression (1 subject), and cholangitis (1 subject). \nAdverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in the gemcitabine arm included \nabdominal pain upper (1 subject), fatigue (3 subjects), malignant neoplasm progression \n(2 subjects), pneumonia (1 subject), and hip fracture (1 subject). Malignant neoplasm \nprogression was the most common SAE, occurring in 13 (32.5%) subjects; anemia and \nfatigue were the second most common SAEs, occurring in 3 (7.5%) subjects each. Thirteen \n(32.5%) subjects died during study treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 16 of 66 \nincluding 9 subjects who received tivantinib and 4 subjects who received gemcitabine. None \nof the AEs leading to death was considered related to treatment. Malignant neoplasm was the \nreason for death for all 9 subjects in the tivantinib treatment group.  \nARQ 197-215 \nARQ 197-215 was a randomized, placebo-controlled study of tivantinib in subjects with \nHCC who had radiographic disease progression after systemic first-line therapy or were \nunable to tolerate the therapy. Subjects randomized to placebo were given the opportunity to \nreceive tivantinib under open-label crossover after they had documented radiographic disease \nprogression during the double-blind portion.   \nBased on healthy volunteer studies and on previous clinical trials in subjects with cancer, a \ndosing regimen of crystalline tivantinib at 360 mg BID (capsule formulation) was \nrecommended for all clinical trials.  Following notification of a Grade 5 pancytopenia event, \na detailed review of all cases of Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia was conducted. A review of the data \nidentified 10 subjects who developed Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia.  Eight severe neutropenia \nevents occurred within the first month of treatment with study drug; one case occurred in the \nfirst week of Cycle 2, and one transient Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in Cycle 3. Three \nsubjects who developed Grade 4 (febrile) neutropenia in Cycle 1 died within 30 days from \nthe onset of the event, though the study drug was not held as recommended by the revised \nprotocol. The review showed a higher rate of Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia, occurring in \napproximately 20% of HCC subjects, compared to approximately 5% in the total population \nof subjects who received tivantinib. Based on this observation, coupled with the higher \nexposure found in the HCC subject population, the decision was made to reduce the dose of \ntivantinib to 240 mg BID (capsule formulation) for all subjects in this study.  \nA total of 107 subjects were enrolled and treated in this study. The most common reasons for \ndiscontinuing treatment during the double-blind period were disease progression (68.2%) and \ndeath (13.1%).  Twenty-three of the 36 subjects who had been randomized to the placebo \ngroup entered the crossover period and were treated with tivantinib. The most common \n(\u2265 10%) AEs during the double-blind period of the study were asthenia (24.3%), fatigue \n(23.4%), decreased appetite (22.4%), diarrhea (19.6%), edema peripheral (19.6%), \nneutropenia (18.7%), ascites (16.8%), anemia (15.9%), abdominal pain (15.0%), cough \n(13.1%), pyrexia (12.1%), and nausea (11.2%). Severe AEs that occurred in at least a 2-fold \ngreater frequency in tivantinib-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects included \nneutropenia (14.1% versus 0) and anemia (12.7% versus 0). The frequency of these severe \nAEs was lower in the 240 mg BID group compared to the 360 mg BID group (neutropenia \n[6.1% versus 21.1%], anemia [9.1% versus 15.8%]). Severe AEs of myelosuppression were \nreported only in the tivantinib treatment group. Twenty-one of 107 (19.6%) subjects had AEs \nthat led to treatment discontinuation during the double-blind period, including 6 of \n33 (18.2%) subjects in the tivantinib 240 mg BID group, 7 of 38 (18.4%) subjects in the \ntivantinib 360 mg BID group, and 8 of 36 (22.2%) subjects in the placebo group.  The most \ncommon AE leading to discontinuation from study treatment was disease progression \n(6.5%).Three of 23 (13.0%) subjects had AEs that led to treatment discontinuation during the \ncrossover period, including asthenia (1 subject) and disease progression (2 subjects).  SAEs \nwere reported for 38 of 107 (35.5%) subjects, including 24 of 71 (33.8%) subjects treated \nwith tivantinib and 14 of 36 (38.9%) subjects treated with placebo. The most common \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 17 of 66 \n(\u2265 5%) SAE reported in this study was disease progression (7.5%).  In this study, 23 (21.5%) \nsubjects died on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug during the double-\nblind period (13 [18.3%] tivantinib-treated subjects and 10 [27.8%] placebo-treated subjects). \nThe 13 deaths that occurred during the double-blind period for tivantinib-treated subjects \nwere attributed to the following causes: disease progression (4 subjects), neutropenic sepsis \n(3 subjects, including one subject who died both of neutropenic sepsis and multiorgan \nfailure), hepatic failure (3 subjects), cachexia (1 subject), hemorrhage (1 subject), and \nmetabolic acidosis (1 subject). The 10 deaths that occurred during the double-blind period for \nplacebo-treated subjects were attributed to the following causes: disease progression \n(4 subjects), cachexia (2 subjects), portal hypertension (1 subject), acute coronary syndrome \nand pulmonary edema (1 subject), upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1 subject), and suicide \n(1 subject). Three of 23 (13.0%) subjects had AEs resulting in death during the crossover \nperiod, including disease progression (2 subjects) and hepatic failure (1 subject).   \nARQ 197-A-U251 \nARQ 197-A-U251 was an open-label study of tivantinib in subjects with relapsed or \nrefractory non-central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors. Twenty-seven subjects were \nenrolled and treated in this study. The primary reason for discontinuation was disease \nprogression in 24 (88.9%) subjects. The most common (\u2265 10%) AEs were fatigue (37.0%), \nnausea (25.9%), cough and dyspnea (22.2% each), vomiting, edema peripheral, and \ndecreased appetite (14.8% each), and constipation, back pain, and neuropathy peripheral \n(11.1% each). AEs of Grade 3 or higher occurred in 12 subjects (44.4%). These included \nanemia, vision blurred, peritoneal hemorrhage, fatigue, hypersensitivity, cellulitis, \npneumonia, neutrophil count decreased, pain in extremity, aphasia, cerebral hemorrhage, \nheadache, hemiplegia, paraparesis, sciatica, spinal cord compression, syncope, insomnia, \ncough, dyspnea, and superior vena caval occlusion, which were reported in 1 subject (3.7%) \neach and back pain, which was reported in 2 subjects (7.4%).  The events of pneumonia and \nsyncope were considered drug-related; all other events of Grade 3 or higher were considered \nnot related to treatment. Three subjects (11.1%) discontinued study treatment due to AEs. \nThree subjects (3.7% each) discontinued study treatment due to Grade 2 ascites, Grade 4 \ncerebral hemorrhage, or Grade 3 sciatica.  Of these AEs, Grade 4 cerebral hemorrhage and \nGrade 3 sciatica were SAEs.  The primary reason of study treatment discontinuation was \nprogressive disease for all 3 subjects. There were no deaths during treatment or within \n30 days of the last dose.   \nARQ 197-A-U303 \nARQ 197-A-U303 is an ongoing Phase 3 randomized, double-blind study of tivantinib in \nsubjects with MET diagnostic-high inoperable HCC treated with one prior systemic therapy. \nIn August 2013, following a higher than expected incidence of neutropenia-related adverse \nevents, the study Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) evaluated all available unblinded data \nincluding preliminary pharmacokinetics. The DMC advised that the tivantinib starting dose \nshould be reduced to 120 mg BID (tablet formulation). The protocol was amended \naccordingly and enrollment continues. This study remains blinded. \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 18 of 66 \nCOMBINATION THERAPY STUDIES \nARQ 197-111 \nARQ 197-111 was an open-label study of tivantinib in combination with erlotinib, in subjects \nwith locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed after at least one prior \ntreatment regimen. A total of 32 subjects were enrolled and treated in this study. Progressive \ndisease (23 [71.9%] subjects) was the most common reason for treatment discontinuation. \nThe most common (\u2265 10%) AEs were fatigue (37.5%), nausea (31.3%), diarrhea (28.1%), \nbradycardia/sinus bradycardia (28.1%), abdominal pain (28.1%), and anemia (21.9%). There \nwere 14 events of myelosuppression (7 anemia, 3 neutropenia, 2 thrombocytopenia, \n1 lymphopenia, and 1 leukopenia) reported in 9 subjects. Among them, 10 events (5 anemia, \n3 neutropenia, 1 thrombocytopenia, and 1 leukopenia) occurred in 6 subjects and were \nconsidered drug-related. Thirteen of the 15 events (86.7%) occurred when subjects were \nreceiving tivantinib at a dose of 360 mg BID (capsule formulation). In this study, a total of \n14 cardiac events (9 sinus bradycardia, 2 bradycardia, 1 cardio-respiratory arrest, \n1 palpitations, and 1 sick sinus syndrome) were reported in 10 subjects. The majority of \nbradycardia events were asymptomatic and resolved. Five of 9 subjects with sinus \nbradycardia, bradycardia, or sick sinus syndrome had a history of bradycardia and/or an \nabnormal ECG finding of sinus arrhythmia at baseline. Three severe cardiac-related events \noccurred in 3 subjects including one Grade 3 sinus bradycardia, one Grade 3 sick sinus \nsyndrome, and one Grade 5 cardiac arrest. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred \nin 7 of 32 (21.9%) subjects. Four of the 7 subjects were discontinued from study medication \ndue to 5 possible or probable drug-related AEs (neutropenia, hypoglycemia, fatigue, nausea, \nand vomiting). Two of the 8 (25%) AEs that resulted in study drug discontinuation were \nSAEs: one of life-threatening severity (neutropenia Grade 4) and the other that resulted in \ndeath (disease progression Grade 5). Other AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were \ncomprised of hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and pleural effusion, each occurring in \n1 subject. Two of 32 (6.3%) subjects had AEs (both fatigue) that led to treatment reductions. \nOne of the events of fatigue was considered to be related to study drug. Serious adverse \nevents were reported for 13 subjects.  There were no predominant SAEs, although disease \nprogression was reported most often (3 of 32 subjects [9.4%]).  There were three SAEs \ninvolving cardiac events, sinus bradycardia, cardio-respiratory arrest, and sick sinus \nsyndrome and 2 reports of syncope possibly related to bradycardia. Five of 32 subjects \n(15.6%) had 6 SAEs that were considered related to combination treatment, including sinus \nbradycardia (Grade 3) in one subject, sick sinus syndrome (Grade 3) in one subject, \nneutropenia (Grade 4) in one subject, neutropenia and leukopenia (both Grade 4) in one \nsubject, and syncope (Grade 3) in one subject. Six (18.8%) deaths occurred during the study \nor within 30 days of study treatment.  All deaths were considered by Investigators to be not \nrelated to combination treatment and were the result of the following: cardiac arrest (1), \ndisease progression (3), hepatic failure (1), and dyspnea (1). \nARQ 197-116 \nStudy ARQ 197-116 was a study of tivantinib in combination with sorafenib in subjects with \nsolid tumors, including RCC, HCC, NSCLC, and melanoma. A total of 87 subjects were \nenrolled and treated in this study. The most common reason for discontinuing treatment was \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 19 of 66 \nprogressive disease (71.3% for radiographic progression and 6.9% for clinical progression). \nThe most common (\u2265 20% of subjects) AEs were diarrhea (46%), fatigue (43.7%), rash \n(43.7%), anorexia (39.1%), weight decreased (37.9%), hypophosphatemia (28.7%), alopecia \n(27.6%), hyperglycemia (26.4%), nausea (25.3%), hypertension (24.1%), vomiting (21.8%), \nhypernatremia (21.8%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (21.8%), and \nlymphopenia (20.7%). The distribution of AEs was similar among all cancer types. The drug-\nrelated AEs reported most frequently (\u2265 20% of subjects) were rash (40.2%), diarrhea \n(37.9%), anorexia (33.3%), fatigue (31.0%), alopecia (25.3%), palmar-plantar \nerythrodysesthesia syndrome (21.8%), and weight decreased (20.7%). Severe AEs \n(\u2265 Grade 3) were experienced by 61 (70.1%) of the 87 subjects.  The severe AEs occurring in \n\u2265 5% of subjects were hypertension (11.5%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome \n(8%), fatigue (6.9%), hyponatremia (6.9%), hypophosphatemia (6.9%), disease progression \n(5.7%), hyperbilirubinemia (5.7%), pneumonia (5.7%), hyperuricemia (5.7%), and rash \n(5.7%). Serious adverse events including deaths were reported by 33 (37.9%) of the \n87 subjects in the study. Infections and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders, and general \ndisorders and administration site conditions were the most frequent system organ classes \n(SOC) with 9.2%, 8.0%, and 6.9% of subjects, respectively. There were 9 subjects with AEs \nthat led to death: 3 with HCC, 2 with lung cancer, and 1 each with RCC, melanoma, breast \ncancer, or other cancer (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus). In four of these subjects, the AE \nleading to death was progressive disease.   \nARQ 197-117 \nARQ 197-117 was an open-label study of tivantinib in combination with gemcitabine in \nsubjects with locally advanced, inoperable, or metastatic primary solid tumors, including \nbreast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer. A total of \n74 subjects were enrolled and treated in this study. The most common reason for \ndiscontinuing tivantinib and gemcitabine treatments was radiographically confirmed disease \nprogression (42 [56.8%] and 40 [54.1%], respectively). The most common AEs were \nthrombocytopenia (56 [75.7%] subjects), anemia (54 [73.0%] subjects), neutropenia \n(51 [68.9%] subjects), fatigue (43 [58.1%] subjects), and nausea (39 [52.7%] subjects). \nSevere AEs (\u2265 Grade 3) were thrombocytopenia (22 [29.7%] subjects), anemia (28 [37.8%] \nsubjects), neutropenia (32 [43.2%] subjects), leukopenia (5 [6.8%] subjects), febrile \nneutropenia (3 [4.1%] subjects), and pancytopenia (1 [1.4%] subjects). There were 19 cardiac \nevents (4 tachycardia, 3 palpitations, 2 atrial fibrillation, 2 congestive cardiac failure, 1 acute \nmyocardial infarction, 1 atrial flutter, 1 bradycardia, 1 cardiomyopathy, 1 cardiopulmonary \nfailure, 1 cyanosis, 1 left ventricular failure, and 1 mitral valve incompetence) reported in \n12 subjects. Overall, 1 of 74 (1.4%) subjects experienced bradycardia, 2 (2.7%) experienced \natrial fibrillation, 3 (4.1%) experienced palpitations, and 3 (4.1%) experienced tachycardia. \nAt the time of the last recorded evaluation, 11 of the 19 (57.9%) cardiac-related events were \nresolved, 7 (36.8%) were ongoing, and 1 (5.3%) subject died. Seventeen of 74 (23.0%) \nsubjects had a total of 21 AEs that led to treatment discontinuation. Seven of the 17 subjects \ndiscontinued due to myelosuppressive events, including neutropenia (4 subjects), \nthrombocytopenia (2 subjects), anemia (2 subjects), and febrile neutropenia (1 subject). Other \nAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were single events each of breast cancer, wound \ncomplication, bacteremia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, sepsis, fatigue, acute respiratory \nfailure, dyspnea, respiratory failure, disease progression, small bowel obstruction, and \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 20 of 66 \npneumonitis. Four of 74 (5.4%) subjects each had one tivantinib dose reduction during the \nstudy period, from 360 mg BID to 240 mg BID (capsule formulation). Adverse events \nleading to dose reductions in these 4 subjects included neutropenia (3 subjects) and fatigue \n(1 subject).  All four subjects were among the 32 subjects who experienced AEs leading to a \nreduction in gemcitabine. All dose reductions for gemcitabine were due to myelosuppressive \nAEs. Serious adverse events were reported for 39 of 74 (52.7%) subjects.  The most \ncommonly reported SAEs were anemia (6 [8.1%] subjects) and disease progression \n(9 [12.2%] subjects. Overall, 15 (20.3%) deaths occurred during study treatment or within \n30 days of the last dose, which resulted from the following: disease progression (8 subjects), \nacute respiratory failure (1 subject), cardiopulmonary failure (1 subject), hepatic failure \n(1 subject), neutropenia (1 subject), sepsis (1 subject), upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage \n(1 subject), and death (1 subject).    \nARQ 197-209 \nARQ 197-209 was a randomized, double-blind study of erlotinib plus tivantinib treatment \ncompared with erlotinib plus placebo, in subjects with inoperable locally advanced or \nmetastatic (Stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC who had received at least one prior chemotherapy \nregimen (other than erlotinib or other EGFR-inhibiting agents). A total of 167 subjects \nenrolled in this study; 84 subjects received erlotinib plus tivantinib and 83 subjects received \nerlotinib plus placebo during the double-blind period. Thirty-five of 83 (42.2%) subjects who \nhad initiated treatment with erlotinib plus placebo crossed over to receive erlotinib plus \ntivantinib. The most common AEs reported in the tivantinib combination arm group were \nrash (65.5%), diarrhea (47.6%), fatigue (33.3%), anorexia (28.6%), nausea and vomiting \n(26.2% each), and pruritus, dry skin, and dyspnea (22.6%, each). Neutropenia was \nexperienced by 8 subjects in this study who were treated with erlotinib plus tivantinib. No \nneutropenia events were experienced by subjects during erlotinib plus placebo treatment. \nSinus bradycardia was reported for 3 of 84 (3.6%) subjects randomized to the tivantinib \ncombination arm (2 drug-related), and 2 of 35 (5.7%) additional subjects treated with \nerlotinib plus tivantinib during the crossover period (1 drug-related), for a total of 5 of \n119 (4.2%) subjects treated with erlotinib plus tivantinib in the study (3 drug-related). \nBradycardia was reported for 1 of 84 (1.2%) subjects in the randomized tivantinib \ncombination arm (considered drug-related) and 1 of 35 (2.9%) subjects in the crossover \npopulation (not drug-related), for a total of 2 of 119 (1.7%) subjects treated with erlotinib \nplus tivantinib. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 18 of \n84 (21.4%) subjects randomized to the tivantinib combination arm and 17 of 83 (20.5%) \nsubjects randomized to the placebo combination arm, including 7 of 35 (20.0%) subjects \nrandomized to the placebo combination arm who crossed over to receive the tivantinib \ncombination treatment. Three subjects had dose reductions, 1 subject in the erlotinib plus \ntivantinib group (due to Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 3 vomiting, and Grade 2 nausea) and 2 in \nthe erlotinib plus placebo group (due to Grade 2 rash pustular in one subject and due to \nGrade 4 diarrhea, Grade 3 dehydration, Grade 3 renal failure acute, and Grade 3 palmar-\nplantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome in another subject). In this study, 74 subjects (44.3%) \nexperienced SAEs. The most common SAE in both treatment arms was disease progression, \nreported for 6 (7.1%) and 7 (8.4 %) subjects in the tivantinib and placebo combination arms, \nrespectively. Adverse events with an outcome of death were reported in 38 subjects (22.8%) \nduring study treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of the study drug; 17 (20.2%) deaths \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 21 of 66 \noccurred in subjects randomized to the tivantinib combination arm and 21 (25.3%) occurred \nin subjects randomized to the placebo combination arm, including 7 subjects who died after \ncrossing over to the tivantinib combination arm. The most frequent cause of death in the \ntivantinib combination and crossover subjects was disease progression (9 subjects). Among \nsubjects in the tivantinib combination arm, 2 subjects died due to AEs considered at least \npossibly related to both tivantinib and erlotinib (leukopenia and pneumonia).    \nARQ 197-A-U252 \nARQ 197-A-U252 was a Phase 1/2 study of tivantinib in combination with irinotecan and \ncetuximab in subjects with colorectal cancer with wild-type KRAS. A total of 131 subjects \nenrolled in this study and 130 were treated. The primary reason for discontinuing treatment \nwas progressive disease (79 [60.3%]). All 130 treated subjects (100%) in both Phase 1 and \nPhase 2 experienced at least one AE. In Phase 1, the most common AEs were fatigue \n(77.8%), nausea and rash (66.7% each), and diarrhea and alopecia (55.6% each). In Phase 2, \nthe most common AEs that occurred in either treatment group were rash, diarrhea, and \nnausea. The most common AEs reported in the tivantinib combination arm were rash \n(59.2%), diarrhea (53.5%), nausea (46.5%), fatigue (43.7%), vomiting (33.8%), neutropenia \n(31.0%), and infections and infestations (29.6%). The proportions of placebo-treated subjects \nversus the proportions of tivantinib-treated subjects with any grade of myelosuppression \nevents were as follows: febrile neutropenia (1.7 % vs. 1.6%), leukopenia (5.1% vs. 8.1%), \nand thrombocytopenia (1.7% vs. 8.1%). Among cardiac disorder AEs of special interest, \nbradycardia and sinus bradycardia were reported by 0% of placebo-treated subjects vs. \n3.2% (bradycardia) and 4.8% (sinus bradycardia) of tivantinib-treated subjects and atrial \nfibrillation was reported by 0% of placebo-treated subjects vs. 3.2% of tivantinib-treated \nsubjects. Acute renal failure was reported by 0% of placebo-treated subjects and 3.6% of \ntivantinib-treated subjects during Phase 2. In Phase 1, two subjects discontinued study drug \nbecause of an AE. In Phase 2, a higher proportion of tivantinib-treated subjects than placebo-\ntreated subjects discontinued study drug due to an AE (19.4% vs. 11.9%). The most common \nAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were neutropenia and rash. One subject \neach had serious Grade 4 unrelated AEs of renal failure (acute), respiratory failure, or \nurosepsis that led to discontinuation from study medication. No deaths were reported for any \nof the 9 subjects in the Phase 1 portion of the study. In Phase 2, two subjects in each \ntreatment group died within 30 days of the end of study drug administration due to a SAE. \nAn additional 3 subjects in each treatment group died due to disease progression after that \ntime period. No AEs leading to death were considered related to study drug.   \nARQ 197-A-U302 \nARQ 197-A-U302 was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of tivantinib \nin combination with erlotinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic, non-squamous \nNSCLC. The study enrolled 1048 subjects, and 1037 subjects were included in the safety \nanalysis. Nine hundred seventy-eight (93.3%) subjects discontinued treatment. The most \ncommon reason for discontinuation was progressive disease; 645 (61.5%) subjects \ndiscontinued for radiographically confirmed progressive disease and another 90 (8.6%) \nsubjects discontinued for clinical disease progression. Adverse events were the reason for \ndiscontinuation for 113 (10.8%) subjects. The most common AEs within the erlotinib plus \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 22 of 66 \ntivantinib (ET) and the erlotinib plus placebo (EP) groups were diarrhea (ET: 34.6%, \nEP: 41.0%), rash (ET: 33.1%, EP: 37.3%), decreased appetite (ET: 29.0%, EP: 28.8%), \ndyspnea (ET: 26.2%, EP: 22.6%), and fatigue (ET: 26.2%, EP: 21.9%). The AEs indicative \nof myelosuppression were more frequent in the ET group compared with the EP group: \nneutropenia by any preferred term (ET: 13.8%, EP: 2.3%), febrile neutropenia (ET: 3.3%, \nEP: 0.4%), leukopenia (ET: 5.8%, EP: 1.0%), and anemia by any preferred term (ET: 16.7%, \nEP: 10.3%). The occurrence of these AEs at a severity of \u2265 Grade 3 was also more common \nin the ET group. Bradycardia was reported in 2.7% of subjects in the ET group and in no \nsubjects in the EP group; however, only 2 of the 14 cases in the ET group were of Grade 3 or \nhigher severity. Overall, 138 subjects (79 subjects [15.2%] in the tivantinib combination arm, \n59 subjects [11.4%] in the placebo combination arm) were discontinued from treatment \nbecause of AEs. Overall, there were 410 (39.5%) subjects with SAEs reported during the \nstudy; the most commonly reported SAEs were respiratory events including dyspnea and \npulmonary embolism, reported in 5.2% and 3.4% of subjects overall. Overall, 614 subjects \ndied during the study or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, most frequently as the \nresult of disease progression as attributed by the Investigator. A total of 142 subjects had \ndeaths associated with AEs: ET: 77 subjects, EP: 65 subjects. However, the Investigator \nultimately determined that many of these AEs were part of the underlying disease and \nattributed the deaths to disease progression. Using this revised Investigator attribution, \n66 subjects died as a result of AEs (other than disease progression): ET: 32 subjects; \nEP: 34 subjects. Of these deaths associated with AEs (other than disease progression), the \nmost common AEs were respiratory failure (ET: 5 subjects, EP: 6 subjects), sepsis or septic \nshock (ET: 5 subjects, EP: 1 subject), and pneumonia or bronchopneumonia (ET: 3 subjects, \nEP: 5 subjects). Five deaths in the ET group and 3 deaths in the EP group were considered by \nthe Investigator to be related to tivantinib/placebo.   \nDetailed data describing the clinical administration of tivantinib and complete safety \ninformation can be found in the Tivantinib Investigator\u2019s Brochure.12 \n \nArQule, Inc.  18 February 2014 ARQ 197-299 Amendment 2  Confidential Page 23 of 66 ",

Temporary dose interruption and/or dose reduction may be necessary due to adverse events. For recommendations for skin adverse events, see Table A4-1. If dose reduction is necessary, the sorafenib dose may be reduced to once a day. If further dose reduction is necessary, sorafenib may be given once every other day. Sorafenib (Nexavar\uf6da) Dose Modification Table A4-1 Sorafenib Dose Modifications for Dermatologic Toxicity Skin Toxicity Grade Occurrence Suggested Dose Modification Grade 1: Numbness, dysesthesia, paresthesia, tingling, painless swelling, erythema, or discomfort of the hands or feet that does NOT disrupt the subject\u2019s normal activities Any occurrence Continue treatment with sorafenib and consider topical therapy for symptomatic relief. Grade 2: Painful erythema and swelling of the hands or feet and/or discomfort affecting the subject\u2019s normal activities 1st occurrence Continue treatment with sorafenib and consider topical therapy for symptom relief. No improvement within 7 days or 2nd or 3rd occurrence Interrupt sorafenib treatment until toxicity resolves to Grade 0 or 1. When resuming treatment, decrease sorafenib dose by 1 dose level (dosing once a day or once every other day). 4th occurrence Discontinue sorafenib treatment. Grade 3: Moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering, or severe pain of the hands or feet, or severe discomfort that causes the subject to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living 1st or 2nd occurrence Interrupt sorafenib treatment until toxicity resolves to Grade 0 or 1. When resuming therapy, decrease sorafenib by 1 dose level (dosing once a day or once every other day). 3rd occurrence Discontinue sorafenib treatment.

Subjects receiving gemcitabine should be monitored prior to \neach dose with a complete blood count, including differential and platelet count. If marrow \nsuppression is detected, therapy should be modified or suspended according to the guidelines \nin Table A4-2. \nTable A4-2 \nGemcitabine Dosage Reduction Guidelines \nAbsolute Granulocyte \nCount ( \u00d7 106/L) \nPlatelet Count ( \u00d7 106/L) \nPercent of Full Dose (%) \n\u2265 1000 and \n\u2265 100,000 \n100 \n500 \u2013 999 or \n50,000 \u2013 99,999 \n75 \n< 500 or \n< 50,000 \nHold \nLaboratory evaluation of renal and hepatic function, including transaminases and serum \ncreatinine, should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. \nGemcitabine should be administered with caution in subjects who have evidence of \nsignificant renal or hepatic impairment, as there is insufficient information from clinical \nstudies to allow clear dose recommendation for these subject populations. \nRefer to the approved gemcitabine (Gemzar) package insert for details.  \nErlotinib (Tarceva\uf6da) Dose Reduction \nWhen dose reduction is necessary, the erlotinib dose should be reduced by a 50 mg \ndecrement. For this study, no more than 1 dose reduction will be allowed. \nPulmonary Symptoms: In subjects who develop an acute onset of new or progressive \npulmonary symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, or fever, treatment with erlotinib should be \ninterrupted pending diagnostic evaluation. If interstitial lung disease is diagnosed, erlotinib \nshould be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted, as necessary. \nDiarrhea: Diarrhea can usually be managed with loperamide. Subjects with severe diarrhea \nwho are unresponsive to loperamide or who become dehydrated may require dose reduction \nor temporary interruption of therapy. \nSkin Reactions: Skin reactions experienced by subjects receiving erlotinib tend to be \nmanaged easily with topical therapies and do not require treatment interruption or dose \nmodification (please refer to package insert for details). However, rare subjects with severe \nskin reactions may also require dose reduction or temporary interruption of therapy. \nConcomitant CYP3A4 Inhibitors: In subjects concomitantly treated with a strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, such as atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, \nnefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, or voriconazole, \na dose reduction should be considered if severe adverse reactions occur. \nHepatic Impairment: Erlotinib is eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. \nTherefore, caution should be used when administering erlotinib to subjects with hepatic \nimpairment. Dose reduction or interruption of erlotinib should be considered if severe \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \nARQ 197-299 Amendment 2 \n \nConfidential \nPage 59 of 66 \nadverse reactions occur. For additional dose modification information, please refer to the \npackage insert for erlotinib (Tarceva).  \nIrinotecan (Camptosar) and Cetuximab (Erbitux\uf6da) Dose Reductions \nRefer to the locally applicable irinotecan and cetuximab package inserts for dose reductions, \nmodifications, or delays due to irinotecan- or cetuximab-related toxicities. The recommended \ndose levels for reductions in irinotecan and cetuximab are shown in Table A4-3. General \nrecommendations for dose modifications are provided in Table A4-4. \nSupportive therapy for toxicities associated with irinotecan and/or cetuximab therapy may be \ngiven, according to institutional practice. \nA new cycle of treatment may begin when the ANC is \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L, the platelet count is \n\u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L, and any treatment-related gastrointestinal toxicity is resolved to \u2264 Grade 1. \nThe ANC level at baseline must be \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L and platelet count \u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L. If the \ninitiation of a new cycle or treatment during a cycle is delayed for 4 weeks or longer, the \nsubject should be removed from study treatment.

ARQ 197 selectively \ninhibits tyrosine kinase, c-Met, which has been \nimplicated in tumor invasiveness and \nmetastasis.  \nTivantinib is the most advanced representative of a \nnewly discovered class of trans 3,4 disubstituted \npyrrolidine-2,5-diones having the potential to treat \ncancer.  Tivantinib is a novel, small molecule \ninhibitor of c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase. The \nexpression of c-MET is dysregulated in many types \nof human malignancies with overexpression of c-\nMET kinase, c-MET-activating genetic mutations, \nc-MET amplifications, and increased expression of \nthe c-MET ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). \nThis dysregulation is implicated with a poor \nprognosis with greater tumor proliferation and \nincreased angiogenesis with migration and \ninvasion.  \nActivation of c-Met results in the binding and \nphosphorylation of adaptor proteins such as \nGab-1, Grb-2, Shc, and c-Cbl, and subsequent \nactivation of signal transducers such as PI3K, \nPLC-g, STATs, ERK1 and 2 and FAK.  c-Met \nand HGF are expressed in numerous tissues \nand their expression is normally confined \npredominantly to cells of epithelial and \nmesenchymal origin, respectively.  c-Met and \nHGF are dysregulated in human cancers and \nmay contribute to dysregulation of cell growth, \ntumor cell dissemination, and tumor invasion \nduring disease progression and metastasis.  c-\nMet and HGF are highly expressed relative to \nsurrounding tissue in numerous cancers and \nthis expression correlates with poor subject \nprognosis.  c-Met and HGF may protect tumors \nagainst cell death induced by DNA-damaging \nDeleted \n \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 4 of 53 \n \nagents and, as such, may contribute to \nchemoresistance and radioresistance of tumors.  \nTherefore, inhibitors of c-Met may be useful as \ntherapeutic agents in the treatment of malignant \nproliferative disorders.  \n \nActivation of c-MET results in the binding and \nphosphorylation of adaptor proteins such as growth \nfactor receptor-bound-associated binder-1 (Gab-1), \ngrowth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb-2), Src \nhomology 2 domain-containing and Casitas \nB-lineage lymphoma progene (c-Cbl), and \nsubsequent activation of signaling pathways, \nincluding phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/activated \nprotein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), focal adhesion \nkinase-1 (FAK), signal transducers and activators \nof transcription protein (STAT), and mitogen-\nactivated protein kinase/ERK (Ras/MEK/Erk) \npathways. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor \nand HGF are expressed in numerous tissues and \ntheir expression is normally confined \npredominantly to cells of epithelial and \nmesenchymal origin, respectively. Mesenchymal-\nepithelial transition factor and HGF are deregulated \nin human cancers and may contribute to \ndysregulation of cell growth, tumor cell \ndissemination, and tumor invasion during disease \nprogression and metastasis. Mesenchymal-\nepithelial transition factor and HGF are highly \nexpressed relative to surrounding tissue in \nnumerous cancers, and this expression correlates \nwith poor subject prognosis. Mesenchymal-\nepithelial transition factor and HGF may protect \ntumors against cell death induced by \ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents \nand, as such, may contribute to chemoresistance \nand radioresistance of tumors. Therefore, inhibitors \nof c-MET may be useful as therapeutic agents in \nthe treatment of proliferative disorders. \nAdded \nTivantinib selectively inhibits the inactive or \nunphosphorylated form of human c-MET and \nshows in vitro biochemical activity against \nrecombinant c-MET with an inhibition constant \n(Ki) of approximately 355 nM. The potency of \ntivantinib inhibition of c-MET activity is \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 5 of 53 \n \nindependent of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) \nconcentration, which suggests that tivantinib\u2019s \ninhibition is of noncompetitive nature. Tivantinib \nwas profiled against 230 protein kinases, and while \ntivantinib inhibits c-MET kinase activity, it is not a \npromiscuous kinase inhibitor. \nIn nonclinical studies, tivantinib showed broad-\nspectrum in vitro anti-cancer activity against \nhuman tumor cell lines, including breast, colon, \nlung, pancreas, and gastric cancer cell lines. The \npotency of tivantinib in cancer cells expressing \ndetectable c-MET in anti-proliferative assays yield \nIC50 values from 0.1 mM to 0.6 mM. The ability of \ntivantinib to inhibit c-MET phosphorylation \ncorrelated with its ability to inhibit growth in c-\nMET expressing cancer cells, thereby indicating its \nanti-cancer activity. In single-agent in vivo studies, \ntivantinib was shown to be efficacious against \nmultiple human cancer xenograft models and was \nwell tolerated without drug-related clinical signs or \ndeaths. \nThe tivantinib development program is predicated \non the hypothesis that tivantinib-mediated \ninhibition of the c-MET pathway, either alone or in \ncombination with other anti-cancer compounds, \nwill be beneficial in treating malignancies.  \n1.1 Overview of Clinical Experience (pp.10-11) \nARQ 197 has been or is currently being \nevaluated in ten Phase 1 clinical studies, four in \nhealthy normal volunteers to assess \npharmacokinetics (PK) and bioavailability \n(ARQ 197-110 (to assess different \npolymorphic forms), ARQ 197-112 (to assess \nPK in CYP2C19 poor and normal \nmetabolizers), ARQ 197-113 (to assess \ndifferent polymorphic forms), and ARQ 197-\nA-U151) and six dose escalation studies \ninvolving subjects with advanced solid tumors \n(ARQ 197-101, ARQ 197-103, ARQ 197-111, \nARQ 197-114, ARQ 197-116, and ARQ 197-\n117).  Five Phase 2 studies are being \nconducted, including one randomized placebo \ncontrolled combination study with erlotinib in \nsubjects with previously treated non small-cell \nAs of 23 Aug 2013, 30 Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies \n(completed and ongoing) have been conducted; \nrefer to the IB for additional information on these \nstudies. One Phase 3 study in subjects with non-\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is ongoing (ARQ \n197-006) and one is completed (ARQ 197-A-\nU302). A Phase 3 study in subjects with \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is ongoing (ARQ \n197-A-U303). Completed and ongoing studies have \nincluded subjects with colorectal cancer, gastric \ncancer, HCC, microphthalmia transcription factor \nassociated tumors, non-central nervous system \ngerm cell tumors, NSCLC, and pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma. Approximately 127 healthy \nsubjects have received tivantinib in completed \nPhase 1 studies.  Another 2691 subjects with cancer \nhave been randomized in ongoing or completed \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 6 of 53 \n \nlung cancer (ARQ 197-209), one single agent \nopen label study in subjects with \nmicrophthalmia transcription factor associated \ntumors (ARQ 197-204), one randomized, \nplacebo controlled single agent study in \nsubjects with unresectable hepatocellular \ncarcinoma (ARQ 197-215), one single agent \nopen label study in subjects with relapsed or \nrefractory germ cell tumors (ARQ 197-A-\nU251), and one randomized, placebo controlled \ncombination study irinotecan and cetuximab in \nsubjects with previously treated wild-type \nKRAS   metastatic colorectal cancer (ARQ \n197-A-U252). In addition, one Phase 2 \nrandomized, open-label single agent (ARQ 197 \nvs. gemcitabine) study (now terminated) was \nconducted in subjects with advanced pancreatic \ncarcinoma (ARQ 197-205). \nPhase 1, 2, and 3 studies of tivantinib. Phase 1 and \nPhase 2 studies demonstrated early clinical activity \nof tivantinib as monotherapy and in combination \nwith other anticancer agents (including erlotinib, \nsorafenib, gemcitabine, irinotecan, and cetuximab).  \n \nClinical PK data from multiple ARQ 197 \nclinical studies demonstrated that the Cmax \nincreased with increasing doses of ARQ 197; \nhowever, the exposure was not dose \nproportional. Inter-subject variability in PK \nappears to be due in part to CYP 2C19 genetic \npolymorphism. In healthy normal volunteers \n(Study ARQ 197-112) the PK of ARQ 197 was \ncompared in CYP 2C19 poor metabolizers \n(PMs) vs CYP 2C19 extensive metabolizers \n(EMs).  The study confirmed that CYP 2C19 \nPMs had much higher exposure as reflected by \nAUC(0-48) and Cmax (11-fold and 3-fold higher, \nrespectively and lower clearance (mean of 2.4 \nL/hr versus mean of 33.9 L/hr) than EMs.   \nClinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of tivantinib \nhave been conducted in 14 Phase 1 studies that \ninclude 127 healthy subjects and 426 subjects with \ncancer. In general, AUC and Cmax increased with an \nincreasing dose of tivantinib, although this increase \nwas not dose proportional.  \nFollowing human oral administration with a meal, \ntivantinib is rapidly and almost completely \nabsorbed. The drug is extensively metabolized by \nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 isozymes with no parent \ncompound being detected in the urine and only \ntraces of parent compound being detected in the \nfeces. Tivantinib exposure is affected by the \nfollowing factors: CYP2C19 genotype, history of \nhepatocellular carcinoma, coadministration of a \nCYP3A4 inhibitor, dosage form (i.e., crystalline vs. \namorphous), formulation (capsule vs. tablet), and \nfed status during tivantinib administration. \n1.1.1 Summary of the Most Common Drug \nRelated AEs and SAEs (pp.11-29) \n1.1.1 Safety in Clinical Trials (pp.11-29) \n \nAdded \nTivantinib demonstrated a manageable safety \nprofile with adverse drug reactions of \nmyelosuppression (including anemia, neutropenia, \nfebrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, \npancytopenia, and neutropenic sepsis) and \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 7 of 53 \n \nbradycardia. The majority of drug-related adverse \nevents (AEs) have been mild to moderate with \nmanageable toxicities.  \nMyelosuppression \nMyelosuppression (including anemia, neutropenia, \nfebrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, \npancytopenia, and neutropenic sepsis) has been \nreported in single agent and combination therapy \nclinical studies of tivantinib.  There have been fatal \noutcomes for some neutropenic events. Complete \nblood count should be performed as advised in the \nprotocols.  Caution is advised when any CYP2C19 \ninhibitors and/or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are \nused as concomitant therapy, and in subjects with \nknown CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status. Dose \nmodifications were made in the HCC studies \nbecause of higher incidences of neutropenia and \nfebrile neutropenia, which were associated with \nhigher drug levels in these subjects.  Subjects who \nexperience severe myelosuppression including \nneutropenia should be monitored more closely \nthroughout the study, and dose modifications or \ninterruptions should be made as specified in the \noriginal protocols. For subjects with severe \nneutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or neutropenic \nsepsis, supportive care, including use of \nhaematopoietic growth factors and antibiotics \nshould be considered. \nBradycardia \nBradycardia has been reported in single agent and \ncombination therapy clinical studies of tivantinib. \nIn general, bradycardia was most commonly \nreported as a nonserious adverse event. Most of \nthese events were mild to moderate in severity \n(Grade 1\u20132.) Most subjects were asymptomatic and \nrecovered without additional therapy, though the \nbradycardic effect may be prolonged. However, \ncases of bradycardia requiring hospitalization have \nbeen reported, and some subjects received \nplacement of permanent pacemakers. \nSubjects who appear to be at a greater risk for \nsevere bradycardia are those with pre-existing \nbradycardia or sick sinus syndrome or those \npatients receiving beta-blocker therapy. In these \npatients, tivantinib should be used with caution. \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 8 of 53 \n \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is \nrecommended prior to initiation of tivantinib \ntherapy and is to be repeated at any visit when a \nsubject has a heart rate \u226450 beats per minute (bpm), \nor as clinically indicated. In general, heart rate and \nECG should be monitored as specified in the \noriginal protocol, and dose reduction should be \nconsidered for subjects with persistent bradycardia \nand symptomatic hypotension.     \nInterstitial Lung Disease \nThere have been reports of interstitial lung disease \n(ILD) or similar events in subjects enrolled in \ntivantinib studies. The reported events included \nILD, pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome, acute lung injury, and diffuse alveolar \ndamage.  \nIn the majority of the reports, tivantinib was given \nin combination with agents with known association \nwith ILD, including erlotinib and gemcitabine. An \nassociation of tivantinib and ILD has not been \nestablished. However, it is recommended to \ninvestigate the cause for a marked increase in \nrespiratory symptoms in subjects participating in \ntivantinib studies, particularly in Asian patients. \nMONOTHERAPY STUDIES \nARQ 197-101 \nARQ 197-101 was an open-label study of tivantinib \nin subjects with metastatic solid tumors, including \nrenal cell carcinoma (RCC) and other c-MET-\nexpressing tumors, that were refractory to available \nsystemic therapies or for whom no standard \neffective systemic therapy existed. A total of 79 \nsubjects were enrolled and treated in this study.  \nThe most common reasons for discontinuing \ntreatment were disease progression (59.5%), \nsymptomatic deterioration without evidence of \nprogression (19.0%), and subject request (10.1%). \nThe most common (\u2265 10%) AEs were fatigue \n(40.5%), nausea and vomiting (27.8% each), \nanemia/hemoglobin decreased (24.0%), and \ndiarrhea (21.5%). One subject had an AE \n(neutropenia) that led to a dose reduction, which \nwas considered drug-related. A total of 28 of 79 \n(35.4%) subjects reported serious adverse events \n(SAEs).  The most common SAEs were disease \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 9 of 53 \n \nprogression and dehydration, each experienced by 5 \n(6.3%) subjects. There were eight deaths within \n30 days of the last dose of study drugs; five of the \ndeaths resulted from disease progression.  The \nother deaths, one each, were due to the following: \ncardio-pulmonary arrest, pancytopenia, and \nrespiratory failure. \nARQ 197-103 \nARQ 197-103 was an open-label study of tivantinib \nin subjects with advanced solid tumors who were \nrefractory to available therapy or for whom no \nstandard effective systemic therapy existed, \nincluding subjects with advanced prostate cancer. A \ntotal of 51 subjects were enrolled and treated in this \nstudy.  The most common reasons for discontinuing \ntreatment were progressive disease (74.5%), AE \n(13.7%), and symptomatic deterioration without \nevidence of progression (5.9%). The most common \nAEs were fatigue (49.0%), nausea (29.4%), anemia \n(27.5%), vomiting (25.5%), anorexia and \nconstipation (23.5% each), and back pain and \nweight decreased (21.6% each). Seven (13.7%) \nsubjects experienced AEs that led to treatment \ndiscontinuation. Two subjects discontinued \ntreatment due to hyperbilirubinaemia and one \nsubject each discontinued treatment due to chest \ninfection, infection, fatigue, palmar-plantar \nerythrodysesthesia syndrome, febrile neutropenia, \nand nausea. Serious adverse events were reported \nin 22 (43.1%) subjects.  Serious adverse events \nreported at a \u2265 5% incidence (more than one \nsubject) were febrile neutropenia (5.9%) and \ndisease progression (9.8%). There were five deaths \nduring treatment or within 30 days of the last dose \nof study drug.  All deaths were due to disease \nprogression and were judged to be not related to \nstudy drug. \nARQ 197-114 \nARQ 197-114 was an open-label study of tivantinib \nin cirrhotic subjects with HCC who had received \nnot more than two prior systemic regimens. A total \nof 21 subjects were enrolled and treated in this \nstudy.

In this study, AEs \nleading to dose reduction occurred in 4 of 21 \n(19.0%) subjects and all were considered to be \ndrug-related.  One subject had a dose reduction due \nto neutropenia and anemia. A second subject had \ndose reduction due to bradycardia and dyspnea. A \nthird subject had dose reduction due to anemia. The \nfourth subject had a dose reduction due to asthenia. \nSerious adverse events reported for more than one \nsubject were neutropenia (three subjects), and \nanemia, leukopenia, and disease progression (two \nsubjects each). Five subjects died during treatment \nor within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. \nThe cause of death in one subject (septic shock) \nwas considered related to study drug. Other deaths \nwere considered unrelated to study drug and were \nthe result of the following causes: disease \nprogression (two subjects), peritoneal hemorrhage \n(one subject), and pneumonia (one subject). \nARQ 197-A-U157 \nARQ 197-A-U157 was an open-label, randomized, \ntwo-treatment, two-period, two-way crossover, \nrelative bioavailability study of a capsule and a \ntablet formulation of tivantinib in subjects with \nadvanced solid tumors. A total of 26 subjects were \nenrolled in the study and 25 (96.2%) completed the \n14-day crossover study phase. One subject \nwithdrew from the 14-day crossover study phase \ndue to disease progression, and 25 (96.2%) subjects \ncontinued in the extension phase. Bradycardia was \nreported for 6 of 26 (23.1%) subjects and 6 of \n25 (24.0%) subjects in the cross-over and extension \nphases, respectively; the majority of the events of \nbradycardia were considered related to study \ntreatment. Neutropenia was reported for 4 of 25 \n(16.0%) subjects in the extension phase; 2 subjects \nhad neutropenia that was considered to be study-\ndrug related. Most of the AEs were Grade 1 or \nGrade 2.

There were no SAEs reported \nduring the crossover phase of the study. During the \nextension phase of the study, four subjects had \nSAEs considered unrelated to study treatment and \nthree of these subjects died due to the SAEs, which \nincluded progressive disease (fatal), respiratory \nfailure (fatal), and metastatic NSCLC (fatal). None \nof the deaths were considered related to study \ntreatment. \nARQ 197-0701 \nARQ 197-0701 was an open-label study of \ntivantinib in Japanese subjects with advanced or \nrecurrent solid tumors who had been classified as \nextensive metabolizers (EM) or poor metabolizers \n(PM) based on CYP2C19 genotype, including 25 \nsubjects with NSCLC, and who were refractory to \navailable therapy or for whom no standard therapy \nexisted. A total of 47 subjects were enrolled and \ntreated in the study. The most common reason for \ndiscontinuing treatment was disease progression \n(43 subjects). Sixteen SAEs were reported in 11 \nsubjects.  Two SAEs were reported more than once: \nneutrophil count decreased (2 subjects) and white \nblood cell count decreased (2 subjects). No subjects \ndied during the study or within 30 days of the last \ndose of study drug. \nARQ 197-A-U158 \nARQ 197-A-U158 was a Phase 1, open-label, \nsingle-sequence, crossover study to determine the \neffect of multiple doses of tivantinib on the single-\ndose PK of omeprazole/S-warfarin/caffeine/ \nmidazolam and digoxin when co-administered with \ntivantinib in cancer subjects. A total of 28 subjects \nwere enrolled into the study. All 28 subjects \ncompleted Probe Reference Treatment and initiated \ntivantinib.  Twenty-two (78.6%) subjects \ncompleted the Primary Objective Phase. Of the six \n(21.4%) subjects who discontinued from the \nPrimary Objective Phase, three (10.7%) \ndiscontinued due to an AE, two (7.1%) due to other \nreasons, and one (3.6%) due to progressive disease.  \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 12 of 53 \n \nThe most commonly reported AEs were fatigue (7 \n[25.0%] subjects), constipation (5 [17.9%] \nsubjects), and vomiting (5 [17.9%] subjects). \nTwenty-four SAEs were reported in 13 subjects.  \nDisease progression was reported in 4 subjects, \nanemia was reported in 3 subjects, and neutropenia, \nnausea, vomiting, and white blood cell count \ndecreased were each reported in 2 subjects. No \nsubject died due to an adverse event during the \nPrimary Objective Phase of the study or during the \nExtension Phase. Three subjects died after \ncompleting the Primary Objective Phase and one \nsubject died before completing the Primary \nObjective Phase, all due to disease progression.   \nARQ 197-A-U159 \nARQ 197-A-U159 was a single-blind, single-\nsequence study assessing the effect of tivantinib on \nthe QTc interval in subjects with cancer.

The most common reasons for \ndiscontinuing treatment during the double-blind \nperiod were disease progression (68.2%) and death \n(13.1%).  Twenty-three of the 36 subjects who had \nbeen randomized to the placebo group entered the \ncrossover period and were treated with tivantinib. \nThe most common (\u2265 10%) AEs during the double-\nblind period of the study were asthenia (24.3%), \nfatigue (23.4%), decreased appetite (22.4%), \ndiarrhea (19.6%), edema peripheral (19.6%), \nneutropenia (18.7%), ascites (16.8%), anemia \n(15.9%), abdominal pain (15.0%), cough (13.1%), \npyrexia (12.1%), and nausea (11.2%). Severe AEs \nthat occurred in at least a 2-fold greater frequency \nin tivantinib-treated subjects compared to placebo-\ntreated subjects included neutropenia (14.1% \nversus 0) and anemia (12.7% versus 0). The \nfrequency of these severe AEs was lower in the 240 \nmg BID group compared to the 360 mg BID group \n(neutropenia [6.1% versus 21.1%], anemia [9.1% \nversus 15.8%]). Severe AEs of myelosuppression \nwere reported only in the tivantinib treatment \ngroup. Twenty-one of 107 (19.6%) subjects had \nAEs that led to treatment discontinuation during the \ndouble-blind period, including 6 of 33 (18.2%) \nsubjects in the tivantinib 240 mg BID group, 7 of \n38 (18.4%) subjects in the tivantinib 360 mg BID \ngroup, and 8 of 36 (22.2%) subjects in the placebo \ngroup.  The most common AE leading to \ndiscontinuation from study treatment was disease \nprogression (6.5%).Three of 23 (13.0%) subjects \nhad AEs that led to treatment discontinuation \nduring the crossover period, including asthenia (1 \nsubject) and disease progression (2 subjects).  \nSAEs were reported for 38 of 107 (35.5%) subjects, \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 17 of 53 \n \nincluding 24 of 71 (33.8%) subjects treated with \ntivantinib and 14 of 36 (38.9%) subjects treated \nwith placebo. The most common (\u2265 5%) SAE \nreported in this study was disease progression \n(7.5%).  In this study, 23 (21.5%) subjects died on \ntreatment or within 30 days of the last dose of study \ndrug during the double-blind period (13 [18.3%] \ntivantinib-treated subjects and 10 [27.8%] placebo-\ntreated subjects). The 13 deaths that occurred \nduring the double-blind period for tivantinib-treated \nsubjects were attributed to the following causes: \ndisease progression (4 subjects), neutropenic sepsis \n(3 subjects, including one subject who died both of \nneutropenic sepsis and multiorgan failure), hepatic \nfailure (3 subjects), cachexia (1 subject), \nhemorrhage (1 subject), and metabolic acidosis (1 \nsubject). The 10 deaths that occurred during the \ndouble-blind period for placebo-treated subjects \nwere attributed to the following causes: disease \nprogression (4 subjects), cachexia (2 subjects), \nportal hypertension (1 subject), acute coronary \nsyndrome and pulmonary edema (1 subject), upper \ngastrointestinal hemorrhage (1 subject), and suicide \n(1 subject). Three of 23 (13.0%) subjects had AEs \nresulting in death during the crossover period, \nincluding disease progression (2 subjects) and \nhepatic failure (1 subject).   \n \nARQ 197-A-U251 \nARQ 197-A-U251 was an open-label study of \ntivantinib in subjects with relapsed or refractory \nnon-central nervous system (CNS) germ cell \ntumors. Twenty-seven subjects were enrolled and \ntreated in this study. The primary reason for \ndiscontinuation was disease progression in 24 \n(88.9%) subjects. The most common (\u2265 10%) AEs \nwere fatigue (37.0%), nausea (25.9%), cough and \ndyspnea (22.2% each), vomiting, edema peripheral, \nand decreased appetite (14.8% each), and \nconstipation, back pain, and neuropathy peripheral \n(11.1% each). AEs of Grade 3 or higher occurred in \n12 subjects (44.4%). These included anemia, vision \nblurred, peritoneal hemorrhage, fatigue, \nhypersensitivity, cellulitis, pneumonia, neutrophil \ncount decreased, pain in extremity, aphasia, \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 18 of 53 \n \ncerebral hemorrhage, headache, hemiplegia, \nparaparesis, sciatica, spinal cord compression, \nsyncope, insomnia, cough, dyspnea, and superior \nvena caval occlusion, which were reported in 1 \nsubject (3.7%) each and back pain, which was \nreported in 2 subjects (7.4%).  The events of \npneumonia and syncope were considered drug-\nrelated; all other events of Grade 3 or higher were \nconsidered not related to treatment. Three subjects \n(11.1%) discontinued study treatment due to AEs. \nThree subjects (3.7% each) discontinued study \ntreatment due to Grade 2 ascites, Grade 4 cerebral \nhemorrhage, or Grade 3 sciatica.  Of these AEs, \nGrade 4 cerebral hemorrhage and Grade 3 sciatica \nwere SAEs.  The primary reason of study treatment \ndiscontinuation was progressive disease for all 3 \nsubjects. There were no deaths during treatment or \nwithin 30 days of the last dose.   \nARQ 197-A-U303 \nARQ 197-A-U303 is an ongoing Phase 3 \nrandomized, double-blind study of tivantinib in \nsubjects with MET diagnostic-high inoperable \nHCC treated with one prior systemic therapy. In \nAugust 2013, following a higher than expected \nincidence of neutropenia-related adverse events, the \nstudy Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) \nevaluated all available unblinded data including \npreliminary pharmacokinetics. The DMC advised \nthat the tivantinib starting dose should be reduced \nto 120 mg BID (tablet formulation). The protocol \nwas amended accordingly and enrollment \ncontinues. This study remains blinded. \nCOMBINATION THERAPY STUDIES \nARQ 197-111 \nARQ 197-111 was an open-label study of tivantinib \nin combination with erlotinib, in subjects with \nlocally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that had \nprogressed after at least one prior treatment \nregimen. A total of 32 subjects were enrolled and \ntreated in this study. Progressive disease (23 \n[71.9%] subjects) was the most common reason for \ntreatment discontinuation. The most common (\u2265 \n10%) AEs were fatigue (37.5%), nausea (31.3%), \ndiarrhea (28.1%), bradycardia/sinus bradycardia \n(28.1%), abdominal pain (28.1%), and anemia \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 19 of 53 \n \n(21.9%). There were 14 events of \nmyelosuppression (7 anemia, 3 neutropenia, 2 \nthrombocytopenia, 1 lymphopenia, and 1 \nleukopenia) reported in 9 subjects. Among them, \n10 events (5 anemia, 3 neutropenia, 1 \nthrombocytopenia, and 1 leukopenia) occurred in 6 \nsubjects and were considered drug-related. Thirteen \nof the 15 events (86.7%) occurred when subjects \nwere receiving tivantinib at a dose of 360 mg BID \n(capsule formulation). In this study, a total of 14 \ncardiac events (9 sinus bradycardia, 2 bradycardia, \n1 cardio-respiratory arrest, 1 palpitations, and 1 \nsick sinus syndrome) were reported in 10 subjects. \nThe majority of bradycardia events were \nasymptomatic and resolved. Five of 9 subjects with \nsinus bradycardia, bradycardia, or sick sinus \nsyndrome had a history of bradycardia and/or an \nabnormal ECG finding of sinus arrhythmia at \nbaseline. Three severe cardiac-related events \noccurred in 3 subjects including one Grade 3 sinus \nbradycardia, one Grade 3 sick sinus syndrome, and \none Grade 5 cardiac arrest. AEs leading to \ntreatment discontinuation occurred in 7 of 32 \n(21.9%) subjects. Four of the 7 subjects were \ndiscontinued from study medication due to 5 \npossible or probable drug-related AEs (neutropenia, \nhypoglycemia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting). Two \nof the 8 (25%) AEs that resulted in study drug \ndiscontinuation were SAEs: one of life-threatening \nseverity (neutropenia Grade 4) and the other that \nresulted in death (disease progression Grade 5). \nOther AEs leading to treatment discontinuation \nwere comprised of hypoglycemia, \nhyperbilirubinemia, and pleural effusion, each \noccurring in 1 subject. Two of 32 (6.3%) subjects \nhad AEs (both fatigue) that led to treatment \nreductions. One of the events of fatigue was \nconsidered to be related to study drug. Serious \nadverse events were reported for 13 subjects.  \nThere were no predominant SAEs, although disease \nprogression was reported most often (3 of 32 \nsubjects [9.4%]).  There were three SAEs involving \ncardiac events, sinus bradycardia, cardio-\nrespiratory arrest, and sick sinus syndrome and 2 \nreports of syncope possibly related to bradycardia. \nFive of 32 subjects (15.6%) had 6 SAEs that were \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 20 of 53 \n \nconsidered related to combination treatment, \nincluding sinus bradycardia (Grade 3) in one \nsubject, sick sinus syndrome (Grade 3) in one \nsubject, neutropenia (Grade 4) in one subject, \nneutropenia and leukopenia (both Grade 4) in one \nsubject, and syncope (Grade 3) in one subject. Six \n(18.8%) deaths occurred during the study or within \n30 days of study treatment.  All deaths were \nconsidered by Investigators to be not related to \ncombination treatment and were the result of the \nfollowing: cardiac arrest (1), disease progression \n(3), hepatic failure (1), and dyspnea (1). \nARQ 197-116 \nStudy ARQ 197-116 was a study of tivantinib in \ncombination with sorafenib in subjects with solid \ntumors, including RCC, HCC, NSCLC, and \nmelanoma. A total of 87 subjects were enrolled and \ntreated in this study. The most common reason for \ndiscontinuing treatment was progressive disease \n(71.3% for radiographic progression and 6.9% for \nclinical progression). The most common (\u2265 20% of \nsubjects) AEs were diarrhea (46%), fatigue \n(43.7%), rash (43.7%), anorexia (39.1%), weight \ndecreased (37.9%), hypophosphatemia (28.7%), \nalopecia (27.6%), hyperglycemia (26.4%), nausea \n(25.3%), hypertension (24.1%), vomiting (21.8%), \nhypernatremia (21.8%), palmar-plantar \nerythrodysesthesia syndrome (21.8%), and \nlymphopenia (20.7%). The distribution of AEs was \nsimilar among all cancer types. The drug-related \nAEs reported most frequently (\u2265 20% of subjects) \nwere rash (40.2%), diarrhea (37.9%), anorexia \n(33.3%), fatigue (31.0%), alopecia (25.3%), \npalmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome \n(21.8%), and weight decreased (20.7%). Severe \nAEs (\u2265 Grade 3) were experienced by 61 (70.1%) \nof the 87 subjects.

Serious \nadverse events including deaths were reported by \n33 (37.9%) of the 87 subjects in the study. \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 21 of 53 \n \nInfections and infestations, gastrointestinal \ndisorders, and general disorders and administration \nsite conditions were the most frequent system \norgan classes (SOC) with 9.2%, 8.0%, and 6.9% of \nsubjects, respectively. There were 9 subjects with \nAEs that led to death: 3 with HCC, 2 with lung \ncancer, and 1 each with RCC, melanoma, breast \ncancer, or other cancer (adenocarcinoma of the \nesophagus). In four of these subjects, the AE \nleading to death was progressive disease.   \nARQ 197-117 \nARQ 197-117 was an open-label study of tivantinib \nin combination with gemcitabine in subjects with \nlocally advanced, inoperable, or metastatic primary \nsolid tumors, including breast cancer, \ncholangiocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic \ncancer. A total of 74 subjects were enrolled and \ntreated in this study. The most common reason for \ndiscontinuing tivantinib and gemcitabine treatments \nwas radiographically confirmed disease progression \n(42 [56.8%] and 40 [54.1%], respectively). The \nmost common AEs were thrombocytopenia (56 \n[75.7%] subjects), anemia (54 [73.0%] subjects), \nneutropenia (51 [68.9%] subjects), fatigue (43 \n[58.1%] subjects), and nausea (39 [52.7%] \nsubjects).

There were 19 cardiac events \n(4 tachycardia, 3 palpitations, 2 atrial fibrillation, 2 \ncongestive cardiac failure, 1 acute myocardial \ninfarction, 1 atrial flutter, 1 bradycardia, 1 \ncardiomyopathy, 1 cardiopulmonary failure, 1 \ncyanosis, 1 left ventricular failure, and 1 mitral \nvalve incompetence) reported in 12 subjects. \nOverall, 1 of 74 (1.4%) subjects experienced \nbradycardia, 2 (2.7%) experienced atrial \nfibrillation, 3 (4.1%) experienced palpitations, and \n3 (4.1%) experienced tachycardia. At the time of \nthe last recorded evaluation, 11 of the 19 (57.9%) \ncardiac-related events were resolved, 7 (36.8%) \nwere ongoing, and 1 (5.3%) subject died. \nSeventeen of 74 (23.0%) subjects had a total of 21 \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 22 of 53 \n \nAEs that led to treatment discontinuation. Seven of \nthe 17 subjects discontinued due to \nmyelosuppressive events, including neutropenia (4 \nsubjects), thrombocytopenia (2 subjects), anemia (2 \nsubjects), and febrile neutropenia (1 subject). Other \nAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were \nsingle events each of breast cancer, wound \ncomplication, bacteremia, gastrointestinal \nhemorrhage, sepsis, fatigue, acute respiratory \nfailure, dyspnea, respiratory failure, disease \nprogression, small bowel obstruction, and \npneumonitis. Four of 74 (5.4%) subjects each had \none tivantinib dose reduction during the study \nperiod, from 360 mg BID to 240 mg BID (capsule \nformulation). Adverse events leading to dose \nreductions in these 4 subjects included neutropenia \n(3 subjects) and fatigue (1 subject).  All four \nsubjects were among the 32 subjects who \nexperienced AEs leading to a reduction in \ngemcitabine. All dose reductions for gemcitabine \nwere due to myelosuppressive AEs. Serious \nadverse events were reported for 39 of 74 (52.7%) \nsubjects.  The most commonly reported SAEs were \nanemia (6 [8.1%] subjects) and disease progression \n(9 [12.2%] subjects. Overall, 15 (20.3%) deaths \noccurred during study treatment or within 30 days \nof the last dose, which resulted from the following: \ndisease progression (8 subjects), acute respiratory \nfailure (1 subject), cardiopulmonary failure (1 \nsubject), hepatic failure (1 subject), neutropenia (1 \nsubject), sepsis (1 subject), upper gastrointestinal \nhemorrhage (1 subject), and death (1 subject).    \nARQ 197-209 \nARQ 197-209 was a randomized, double-blind \nstudy of erlotinib plus tivantinib treatment \ncompared with erlotinib plus placebo, in subjects \nwith inoperable locally advanced or metastatic \n(Stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC who had received at least \none prior chemotherapy regimen (other than \nerlotinib or other EGFR-inhibiting agents).

Neutropenia was experienced by 8 subjects \nin this study who were treated with erlotinib plus \ntivantinib. No neutropenia events were experienced \nby subjects during erlotinib plus placebo treatment. \nSinus bradycardia was reported for 3 of 84 (3.6%) \nsubjects randomized to the tivantinib combination \narm (2 drug-related), and 2 of 35 (5.7%) additional \nsubjects treated with erlotinib plus tivantinib during \nthe crossover period (1 drug-related), for a total of \n5 of 119 (4.2%) subjects treated with erlotinib plus \ntivantinib in the study (3 drug-related).

In this study, 74 \nsubjects (44.3%) experienced SAEs. The most \ncommon SAE in both treatment arms was disease \nprogression, reported for 6 (7.1%) and 7 (8.4 %) \nsubjects in the tivantinib and placebo combination \narms, respectively. Adverse events with an \noutcome of death were reported in 38 subjects \n(22.8%) during study treatment or within 30 days \nof the last dose of the study drug; 17 (20.2%) \nArQule, Inc. \n \n18 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \nConfidential \nPage 24 of 53 \n \ndeaths occurred in subjects randomized to the \ntivantinib combination arm and 21 (25.3%) \noccurred in subjects randomized to the placebo \ncombination arm, including 7 subjects who died \nafter crossing over to the tivantinib combination \narm. The most frequent cause of death in the \ntivantinib combination and crossover subjects was \ndisease progression (9 subjects). Among subjects in \nthe tivantinib combination arm, 2 subjects died due \nto AEs considered at least possibly related to both \ntivantinib and erlotinib (leukopenia and \npneumonia).    \nARQ 197-A-U252 \nARQ 197-A-U252 was a Phase 1/2 study of \ntivantinib in combination with irinotecan and \ncetuximab in subjects with colorectal cancer with \nwild-type KRAS. A total of 131 subjects enrolled \nin this study and 130 were treated. The primary \nreason for discontinuing treatment was progressive \ndisease (79 [60.3%]). All 130 treated subjects \n(100%) in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 experienced at \nleast one AE. In Phase 1, the most common AEs \nwere fatigue (77.8%), nausea and rash (66.7% \neach), and diarrhea and alopecia (55.6% each). In \nPhase 2, the most common AEs that occurred in \neither treatment group were rash, diarrhea, and \nnausea.

In \nPhase 2, a higher proportion of tivantinib-treated \nsubjects than placebo-treated subjects discontinued \nstudy drug due to an AE (19.4% vs. 11.9%). The \nmost common AEs leading to discontinuation of \nstudy treatment were neutropenia and rash. One \nsubject each had serious Grade 4 unrelated AEs of \nrenal failure (acute), respiratory failure, or \nurosepsis that led to discontinuation from study \nmedication. No deaths were reported for any of the \n9 subjects in the Phase 1 portion of the study. In \nPhase 2, two subjects in each treatment group died \nwithin 30 days of the end of study drug \nadministration due to a SAE. An additional 3 \nsubjects in each treatment group died due to disease \nprogression after that time period. No AEs leading \nto death were considered related to study drug.   \nARQ 197-A-U302 \nARQ 197-A-U302 was a randomized, double-\nblinded, placebo-controlled study of tivantinib in \ncombination with erlotinib in subjects with locally \nadvanced or metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC. \nThe study enrolled 1048 subjects, and 1037 \nsubjects were included in the safety analysis. Nine \nhundred seventy-eight (93.3%) subjects \ndiscontinued treatment. The most common reason \nfor discontinuation was progressive disease; 645 \n(61.5%) subjects discontinued for radiographically \nconfirmed progressive disease and another 90 \n(8.6%) subjects discontinued for clinical disease \nprogression. Adverse events were the reason for \ndiscontinuation for 113 (10.8%) subjects. The most \ncommon AEs within the erlotinib plus tivantinib \n(ET) and the erlotinib plus placebo (EP) groups \nwere diarrhea (ET: 34.6%, EP: 41.0%), rash (ET: \n33.1%, EP: 37.3%), decreased appetite (ET: 29.0%, \nEP: 28.8%), dyspnea (ET: 26.2%, EP: 22.6%), and \nfatigue (ET: 26.2%, EP: 21.9%). The AEs \nindicative of myelosuppression were more frequent \nin the ET group compared with the EP group: \nneutropenia by any preferred term (ET: 13.8%, EP: \n2.3%), febrile neutropenia (ET: 3.3%, EP: 0.4%), \nleukopenia (ET: 5.8%, EP: 1.0%), and anemia by \nany preferred term (ET: 16.7%, EP: 10.3%).

Overall, 138 \nsubjects (79 subjects [15.2%] in the tivantinib \ncombination arm, 59 subjects [11.4%] in the \nplacebo combination arm) were discontinued from \ntreatment because of AEs. Overall, there were 410 \n(39.5%) subjects with SAEs reported during the \nstudy; the most commonly reported SAEs were \nrespiratory events including dyspnea and \npulmonary embolism, reported in 5.2% and 3.4% \nof subjects overall. Overall, 614 subjects died \nduring the study or within 30 days of the last dose \nof study drug, most frequently as the result of \ndisease progression as attributed by the \nInvestigator. A total of 142 subjects had deaths \nassociated with AEs: ET: 77 subjects, EP: 65 \nsubjects. However, the Investigator ultimately \ndetermined that many of these AEs were part of the \nunderlying disease and attributed the deaths to \ndisease progression.

For \nrecommendations for skin adverse events, see Table A4-1. If dose reduction is necessary, the \nsorafenib dose may be reduced to once a day. If further dose reduction is necessary, sorafenib \nmay be given once every other day. \nSorafenib (Nexavar\uf6da) Dose Modification \nTable A4-1 \nSorafenib Dose Modifications for Dermatologic Toxicity \nSkin Toxicity Grade \nOccurrence \nSuggested Dose Modification \nGrade 1: Numbness, \ndysesthesia, paresthesia, \ntingling, painless swelling, \nAny occurrence \nContinue treatment with \nsorafenib and consider topical \ntherapy for symptomatic relief. \nArQule, Inc. \n \n21 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \n \nConfidential \nPage 47 of 53 \n \nerythema, or discomfort of \nthe hands or feet that does \nNOT disrupt the subject\u2019s \nnormal activities \nGrade 2: Painful erythema \nand swelling of the hands \nor feet and/or discomfort \naffecting the subject\u2019s \nnormal activities \n1st occurrence \nContinue treatment with \nsorafenib and consider topical \ntherapy for symptom relief. \nNo improvement within 7 days \nor 2nd or 3rd occurrence \nInterrupt sorafenib treatment \nuntil toxicity resolves to \nGrade 0 or 1. When resuming \ntreatment, decrease sorafenib \ndose by 1 dose level (dosing \nonce a day or once every other \nday). \n4th occurrence \nDiscontinue sorafenib \ntreatment. \nGrade 3: Moist \ndesquamation, ulceration, \nblistering, or severe pain \nof the hands or feet, or \nsevere discomfort that \ncauses the subject to be \nunable to work or perform \nactivities of daily living \n1st or 2nd occurrence \nInterrupt sorafenib treatment \nuntil toxicity resolves to \nGrade 0 or 1. When resuming \ntherapy, decrease sorafenib by 1 \ndose level (dosing once a day or \nonce every other day). \n3rd occurrence \nDiscontinue sorafenib \ntreatment. \nPlease refer to the approved sorafenib (Nexavar) package insert for details. \n \nGemcitabine (Gemzar\uf6da) Dose Modification \nDosage adjustment of gemcitabine is based upon the degree of hematologic toxicity experienced \nby the subjects. Subjects receiving gemcitabine should be monitored prior to each dose with a \ncomplete blood count, including differential and platelet count. If marrow suppression is detected, \ntherapy should be modified or suspended according to the guidelines in Table A4-2. \nTable A4-2 \nGemcitabine Dosage Reduction Guidelines \nAbsolute Granulocyte \nCount ( \u00d7 106/L) \nPlatelet Count ( \u00d7 106/L) \nPercent of Full Dose (%) \n\u2265 1000 and \n\u2265 100,000 \n100 \n500 \u2013 999 or \n50,000 \u2013 99,999 \n75 \n< 500 or \n< 50,000 \nHold \nLaboratory evaluation of renal and hepatic function, including transaminases and serum \ncreatinine, should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. \nGemcitabine should be administered with caution in subjects who have evidence of significant \nArQule, Inc. \n \n21 February 2014 \n \nARQ 197-299 \n \nConfidential \nPage 48 of 53 \n \nrenal or hepatic impairment, as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow \nclear dose recommendation for these subject populations. \nRefer to the approved gemcitabine (Gemzar) package insert for details.  \nErlotinib (Tarceva\uf6da) Dose Reduction \nWhen dose reduction is necessary, the erlotinib dose should be reduced by a 50 mg decrement. \nFor this study, no more than 1 dose reduction will be allowed. \nPulmonary Symptoms: In subjects who develop an acute onset of new or progressive pulmonary \nsymptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, or fever, treatment with erlotinib should be interrupted \npending diagnostic evaluation. If interstitial lung disease is diagnosed, erlotinib should be \ndiscontinued and appropriate treatment instituted, as necessary. \nDiarrhea: Diarrhea can usually be managed with loperamide. Subjects with severe diarrhea who \nare unresponsive to loperamide or who become dehydrated may require dose reduction or \ntemporary interruption of therapy. \nSkin Reactions: Skin reactions experienced by subjects receiving erlotinib tend to be managed \neasily with topical therapies and do not require treatment interruption or dose modification \n(please refer to package insert for details). However, rare subjects with severe skin reactions may \nalso require dose reduction or temporary interruption of therapy. \nConcomitant CYP3A4 Inhibitors: In subjects concomitantly treated with a strong CYP3A4 \ninhibitor, such as atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, \nnelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, or voriconazole, a dose reduction \nshould be considered if severe adverse reactions occur. \nHepatic Impairment: Erlotinib is eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. \nTherefore, caution should be used when administering erlotinib to subjects with hepatic \nimpairment. Dose reduction or interruption of erlotinib should be considered if severe adverse \nreactions occur. For additional dose modification information, please refer to the package insert \nfor erlotinib (Tarceva).  \nIrinotecan (Camptosar) and Cetuximab (Erbitux\uf6da) Dose Reductions \nRefer to the locally applicable irinotecan and cetuximab package inserts for dose reductions, \nmodifications, or delays due to irinotecan- or cetuximab-related toxicities. The recommended \ndose levels for reductions in irinotecan and cetuximab are shown in Table A4-3. General \nrecommendations for dose modifications are provided in Table A4-4. \nSupportive therapy for toxicities associated with irinotecan and/or cetuximab therapy may be \ngiven, according to institutional practice. \nA new cycle of treatment may begin when the ANC is \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L, the platelet count is \n\u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L, and any treatment-related gastrointestinal toxicity is resolved to \u2264 Grade 1. \nThe ANC level at baseline must be \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 109/L and platelet count \u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L.
