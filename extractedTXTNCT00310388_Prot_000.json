Patient has successfully completed the Maintenance and \nTransition phases of Study VRX-RET-E22-302 for the treatment \nof partial-onset seizures \n2. Patient is expected to benefit from participation in the study in \nthe opinion of the Investigator. \n3. Women of childbearing potential and fertile males have to agree \nto use a medically acceptable method of birth control.  Females \nmust have a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 0, which will \nbe confirmed by the serum \u03b2-HCG pregnancy test at the last \nvisit (Visit 11) of the Transition phase of Study VRX-RET-E22-\n302.  A woman of childbearing potential is defined as a female \nwho is biologically capable of becoming pregnant.  A medically \nacceptable method of birth control includes an intrauterine \ndevice in place for at least 3 months, surgical sterilization (e.g. \ntubal ligation), or adequate barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm and \nfoam).  An oral contraceptive alone is not considered adequate \nfor the purpose of this study. \n4. In the opinion of the Investigator, patient is able to understand \nverbal and written instructions and will adhere to all study \nschedules and requirements. \n5. Patient or legal guardian (if applicable) is informed, given ample \ntime and opportunity to read and/or understand about his/her \nparticipation in the study, and has signed and dated the written \ninformed consent form. \nKEY EXCLUSION \nCRITERIA: \n1. Patient meets any of the withdrawal criteria in the previous VRX-\nRET-E22-302 study or is experiencing an ongoing serious \nadverse event. \n2. Patient is receiving any investigational drug or using any \nexperimental device in addition to Retigabine for treatment of \nepilepsy or any other medical condition. \n3. Patient has any other condition that would prevent compliance \nwith the study procedures or proper reporting of AEs. \n4.

The primary efficacy variable will be the percentage \nchange in the monthly seizure rate from the baseline phase to \nopen-label treatment. The proportion of responders (patients \nexperiencing \u2265 50% reduction in seizure frequency) from \nbaseline to the open-label treatment phase will also be \nevaluated. \n\u2022 \nSafety: Safety will be assessed by measurements of vital signs, \nweight, clinical laboratory evaluations (blood chemistry, \nhematology, and urinalysis), 12-lead ECGs, physical and \nneurological examinations, and evaluations of adverse events. \nPatients will additionally be assessed using the American \nUrological Association Symptom Index to assess the urinary \nvoiding function. \n \nSTATISTICAL \nANALYSIS: \nThe safety population will include all patients who successfully \ncomplete the Transition phase of Study VRX-RET-E22-302 and \nwere included in this long-term study. The Transition phase is the \nphase of Study VRX-RET-E22-302 during which patients were \nadjusted to a 300 mg TID dose of retigabine. No other population for \nanalysis is defined for this long-term extension study. \nAssessment of Efficacy: \n\"Monthly total partial seizure\" as well as \"monthly total seizure\" rates \nwill be calculated for the entire open-label part of Study VRX-RET-\nE22-304 and described statistically. \nBaseline monthly total partial seizure rate from Study VRX-RET-\nE22-302 will be used for the calculation of difference and % change \nin the open-label study. The % change will be classified into <0, [0, \n25), [25, 50), [50, 75), [75, 100] with a description of the \nfrequencies. The responder rate (defined as a reduction in seizure \nfrequency \u226550%) is the sum of the upper two classes.   \n \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n108\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304, Amendment 1 \nJuly 2, 2007 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 19 of 72 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \nSTATISTICAL \nANALYSIS \n(cont): \nAssessment of Efficacy (cont): \nThe number of seizure free days, in percent to the individual \nduration of the open-label treatment, will be calculated and \ndescribed statistically. In addition, frequencies for this percentage \nwill be classified into [0, 25), [25, 50), [50, 75), [75, 95), [95,100), \n=100. The most upper class represents completely seizure free \npatients, the next class almost seizure free patients. \nAdditional details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan \n(SAP). \n \nAssessment of Safety: \nAll adverse events will be encoded according to MedDRA 8.0. \nTreatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) will be analyzed, i.e. all \nadverse events starting or worsening between the start of the long-\nterm open-label study up to 30 days after end of taper-off study drug \nat the completion of the open-label study. Incidences on preferred \nterm and body system basis will be calculated for all TEAEs. In \naddition, all serious adverse events (SAEs) and all AEs leading to \npremature discontinuation will be presented as separate listings. A \nprospective analysis will be conducted in order to compare the \nresults of this study to Study VRX-RET-E22-302. \nTEAE from both studies (double-blind and open-label extension) will \nbe combined, i.e. each patient will be counted just once (with \npatient\u2019s respective TEAE). \nOther safety evaluations, such as vital signs, laboratory variables, \nECG variables, AUA symptom index will be analyzed descriptively. \nAdditional details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan \n(SAP). \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n109\n",

After Study Visit 1, all remaining study visits will have a window range of \u00b17 days around that visit day to accommodate individual schedules. \nEach study month will be defined as 30 calendar days. If a patient visit occurs outside the visit window, the study clinical monitor (CRA) should be notified and the reason for the deviation \nnoted. An attempt should be made to ensure that the patient returns for subsequent visits on schedule using the last visit of the Transition phase (Visit 11) of Study VRX-RET-E22-302, which \ncorresponds to the final, Baseline eligibility visit for the open-label extension study. \n3. \nThis open-label extension study will be continued until retigabine is approved and commercially available, or until the program is discontinued, followed by a 3-week tapering period and a 30 \nday post-study period for collection of adverse events.  After the first year, the study visits will occur every 4 months (3 visits per year).  After the first year, the assessments for the first 2 study \nvisits of each year (e.g. Visits 6, 7, 9 and 10) will be identical, and the assessments for the last study visit of each year (e.g. Visits 8 and 11) will be identical.   \n4. \nAll patients who discontinue early from study treatment during the open-label extension study will have their study medication tapered over a 3-week period, reducing their daily dose by one-\nthird per week, and then return for a final visit.  Patients who discontinue early during the first year of the open-label extension study will complete all assessments and evaluations scheduled \nfor Study Visit 5.  Patients who discontinue early during the second year of the open-label extension study will complete all assessments and evaluations scheduled for Study Visit 8.  Patients \nwho discontinue early during the third year of the open-label extension study will complete all assessments and evaluations scheduled for Study Visit 11.  Also, all adverse events should be \nfollowed and collected up to until 30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug (end of study drug taper-off). \n5. \nSupine and standing blood pressure, heart rate. \n6. \nIn addition to the scheduled pregnancy tests, a pregnancy test should be performed during the study whenever a woman\u2019s menstrual period is 5 days late. \n7. \nThe AUA Symptom Index and the PVR bladder ultrasound will only be performed during the first year of the open-label extension study (Visits 1, 2, and 5).   \n8. \nDispensation of study medication is not applicable at the final study visit, if a patient has discontinued early or completed the open-label extension study. \n9. \nStudy visits added per FDA comments that the open label extension trial should include more frequent hematological monitoring.

In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being of the \nhuman subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society. \n6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve \nprophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the \naetiology and pathogenesis of disease. Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, \nand therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through research for their \neffectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. \n7. In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and \ntherapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens. \n8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human \nbeings and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable \nand need special protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically \ndisadvantaged must be recognized. Special attention is also required for those who \ncannot give or refuse consent for themselves, for those who may be subject to giving \nconsent under duress, for those who will not benefit personally from the research and for \nthose for whom the research is combined with care. \n9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements \nfor research on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international \nrequirements. No national ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should be allowed to \nreduce or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set forth in this \nDeclaration. \nBASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH \n10. It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, health, privacy, and \ndignity of the human subject. \n11. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted \nscientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other \nrelevant sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, \nanimal experimentation. \n12. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may affect the \nenvironment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected. \n13. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects \nshould be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be \nsubmitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a \nspecially appointed ethical review committee, which must be independent of the \nInvestigator, the sponsor or any other kind of undue influence. This independent \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n156\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304, Amendment 1 \nJuly 2, 2007 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 67 of 72 \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \ncommittee should be in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which \nthe research experiment is performed. The committee has the right to monitor ongoing \ntrials. The researcher has the obligation to provide monitoring information to the \ncommittee, especially any serious adverse events. The researcher should also submit to \nthe committee, for review, information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional \naffiliations, other potential conflicts of interest and incentives for subjects. \n14. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations \ninvolved and should indicate that there is compliance with the principles enunciated in \nthis Declaration. \n15. Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically \nqualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. \nThe responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified \nperson and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given \nconsent. \n16. Every medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful \nassessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits to \nthe subject or to others. This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in \nmedical research. The design of all studies should be publicly available. \n17. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects \nunless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and \ncan be satisfactorily managed. Physicians should cease any investigation if the risks are \nfound to outweigh the potential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positive and \nbeneficial results. \n18. Medical research involving human subjects should only be conducted if the importance \nof the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the subject. This is \nespecially important when the human subjects are healthy volunteers. \n19. Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations \nin which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research. \n20. The subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the research project. \n21. The right of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always be respected. \nEvery precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject, the confidentiality \nof the patient's information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's \nphysical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. \n22. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed \nof the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n157\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304, Amendment 1 \nJuly 2, 2007 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 68 of 72 \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \naffiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and \nthe discomfort it may entail. The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from \nparticipation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without \nreprisal. After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician \nshould then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If \nthe consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-written consent must be formally \ndocumented and witnessed. \n23. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be \nparticularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or \nmay consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a \nwell-informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely \nindependent of this relationship. \n24. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of \ngiving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the Investigator must obtain informed \nconsent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. \nThese groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to \npromote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be \nperformed on legally competent persons. \n25. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give \nassent to decisions about participation in research, the Investigator must obtain that \nassent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. \n26. Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy \nor advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents \nobtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The \nspecific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them \nunable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for \nconsideration and approval of the review committee. The protocol should state that \nconsent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the \nindividual or a legally authorized surrogate. \n27. Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of \nresearch, the Investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative \nas well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources \nof funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be \ndeclared in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the \nprinciples laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n158\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304, Amendment 1 \nJuly 2, 2007 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 69 of 72 \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \nADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH \nMEDICAL CARE \n28. The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that \nthe research is justified by its potential prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic value. \nWhen medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to \nprotect the patients who are research subjects. \n29. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against \nthose of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does \nnot exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven \nprophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.1 \n30. At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured of \naccess to the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by \nthe study.2 \n31. The physician should fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the \nresearch. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the \npatient-physician relationship. \n32. In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic \nmethods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from \nthe patient, must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and \ntherapeutic measures, if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-\nestablishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be \nmade the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy. In all cases, \nnew information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. The other \nrelevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed. \n \n \n1 Note of clarification on paragraph 29 of the WMA Declaration of Helsinki \nThe WMA hereby reaffirms its position that extreme care must be taken in making use of a \nplacebo-controlled trial and that in general this methodology should only be used in the \nabsence of existing proven therapy. However, a placebo-controlled trial may be ethically \nacceptable, even if proven therapy is available, under the following circumstances: \n- Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons its use is necessary \nto determine the efficacy or safety of a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method; or \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n159\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304, Amendment 1 \nJuly 2, 2007 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 70 of 72 \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \n- Where a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method is being investigated for a minor \ncondition and the patients who receive placebo will not be subject to any additional risk of \nserious or irreversible harm. \nAll other provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki must be adhered to, especially the need \nfor appropriate ethical and scientific review. \n \n2 Note of clarification on paragraph 30 of the WMA Declaration of Helsinki \nThe WMA hereby reaffirms its position that it is necessary during the study planning process \nto identify post-trial access by study participants to prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic \nprocedures identified as beneficial in the study or access to other appropriate care. Post-trial \naccess arrangements or other care must be described in the study protocol so the ethical \nreview committee may consider such arrangements during its review. \n9.10.2004 \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n160\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304, Amendment 1 July 2, 2007 Open-Label Phase 3 Extension Study Page 71 of 72   CONFIDENTIAL ",

Classical antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) currently provide satisfactory seizure control in approximately 70% of patients; however, the remaining 30% of epilepsy patients are refractory to treatment.  The partial onset seizure is the most common type of seizure that is uncontrolled in adult patients.  The introduction of new AEDs (e.g., vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, zonisamide, and felbamate) during the last decade has increased therapeutic possibilities.  However, data from recent clinical trials demonstrate that none of the newer AEDs provides adequate seizure control in all patients.  The treatment of patients that do not respond to current AEDs remains a problem and motivates the continued search for compounds with high antiepileptic potential and low rates of side effects.  Retigabine (GKE-841 or D-23129), N-[2-amino-4(4-fluorobenzylamino)-phenyl] carbamic acid ethyl ester, is a new chemical entity discovered by ASTA Medica, Germany, and was acquired by Valeant Research & Development (Valeant) for development as an AED for the treatment of partial onset seizures. It is a deaza analog of flupirtine, currently marketed in some regions as a centrally acting analgesic with ancillary muscle relaxing properties. Two Phase 3 studies (VRX-RET-E22-301 and VRX-RET-E22-302) to compare the efficacy and safety of Retigabine (600 mg/day, 900 mg/day, or 1200 mg/day) to placebo as an adjunctive therapy in refractory patients with partial-onset seizures are currently being conducted. These studies are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group trials enrolling a total of approximately 790 patients, globally. Because of the serious nature of epilepsy, the retigabine clinical program had foreseen that all patients who enter and complete a Phase 3 study with retigabine will be given the opportunity to continue treatment, if they consent and if the Principal Investigator feels they can benefit from continued retigabine treatment. Hence, an open-label extension protocol was designed for each double-blind study. This study is the open-label extension of the Phase 3 Study VRX-RET-E22-302. VRX-RET-E22-302 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, study of 900 mg/day and 600 mg/day retigabine versus placebo. During the 4-week titration phase patients are titrated to the target dose.  510 patients are expected to be randomized to treatment. A 12-week maintenance phase follows. All patients who wish to enter the open-label extension protocol will enter a 4-week transition phase in which their dose will be titrated to 300 mg TID in order to maintain the blind to the maximum extent. Thereafter, the patients could enter this extension study (Study VRX-RET-E22-304).

Retigabine also has a concentration-dependent ancillary mode of action by increasing gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-evoked currents.  These effects, however, were seen at concentrations of 10 \u00b5mol/L, whereas the potassium channel-opening effects occur at concentrations as low as 0.1 \u00b5mol/L.11,12 Results from preclinical studies revealed that retigabine is effective in a broad range of animal models of epileptic seizures. Amygdala kindling is considered the most predictive animal model for human complex partial seizures.13 In kindled rats, intraperitoneal or oral doses of retigabine as low as 0.01 mg/kg were effective in increasing the threshold for induction.14 At a higher dose of 5 mg/kg retigabine also reduced seizure severity, seizure duration, and post-discharge duration in fully kindled rats.14 A clear separation between antiepileptic and neurotoxic effects is evident in these preclinical models.  In addition, preclinical testing has not revealed any tolerance, dependence, or withdrawal liabilities for retigabine.15 Retigabine is rapidly absorbed following p.o. (oral) administration with peak plasma concentrations being achieved 1-2 hours after dosing in mice and rats.16,17 The absolute bioavailability ranged from 44% to 70%.17 Retigabine is extensively distributed and rapidly eliminated from all tissues in rats over a 48- to 72-hour period after dosing.18,19 Retigabine is primarily metabolized by acetylation, glucuronidation, and oxidation mechanisms in rats and by glucuronidation in dogs. The active N-acetyl metabolite of retigabine has a pharmacological profile similar to retigabine but is 20 times less potent.20 The major route of excretion in rats and dogs is in feces, with some compound being excreted in urine.21,22,23 In humans, retigabine is mainly metabolized by N-glucuronidation and N-acetylation, and is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.20 Retigabine has low protein binding in all species, including humans.20 Both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that retigabine is unlikely to have any important drug-drug interactions with commonly used drugs.24,25,26,27 ",

The most commonly observed treatment-emergent adverse effects were in the MedDRA system organ class of Nervous System Disorders.  In a double-blind parallel group study comparing different titration rates (Study 3065A1-214), it has been shown that when the starting dose of retigabine is 300 mg/day (100 mg TID), the daily dose can be titrated to 1200 mg over a 6-week period with only 13% of patients discontinuing due to adverse events.  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study comprising 397 patients with epilepsy (Study 3065A1-205)52, daily doses of 900 mg and 1200 mg (administered orally in three divided doses) caused a significant reduction in total partial seizure frequency compared with placebo.  While a dose of 600 mg/day resulted in greater reduction of seizure frequency than placebo, the difference was not statistically significant.  The majority of patients tolerated their treatment as prescribed, with a minority discontinuing from the study prematurely. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events in 1200 mg dose group was about 2.5 times that in placebo group.  This is consistent with tolerability of other AEDs.  The commonly observed adverse events were in the MedDRA system organ class of Nervous System Disorder and many of these were dose related and were more frequent with retigabine compared with placebo.  There were few clinically important changes in vital signs, laboratory, or ECG parameters, or physical or neurological examinations. Patients participating in Study 3065A1-205 were eligible for an open-label extension phase (Study 3065A1-212) if they experienced improvement in seizure control, did not experience adverse events that would prevent inclusion, and did not violate the double-blind study protocol.  Patients who completed the interim (transition) phase of the double-blind portion of the study started with 300 mg TID, which could be increased weekly in increments of 150 mg/day, up to a maximum of 1200 mg daily.  Concomitant AEDs could be adjusted to achieve the best efficacy/safety ratio.  Patients who wished to discontinue retigabine during this open-label study entered a 3-week tapering period and a 10-day post-study follow-up period.  Seizure frequency was recorded daily in a diary maintained by each patient.  The efficacy of retigabine was evaluated by comparison of baseline seizure frequency (determined upon entry into the double-blind phase) with seizure frequency during retigabine therapy in the extension study; this was calculated as a percentage change in total partial seizure frequency. Of the 279 patients who completed Study 205, 222 enrolled in the open-label extension.  The majority of these patients were white (213 or 95.9%) with a median age of 36 years.

In a multiple dose-finding trial using fixed doses, regimens up to 200 mg twice a day (BID) were safe and well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose was found to be 250 mg BID.  However, after allowing for titration to the target dose, regimens up to 350 mg BID were tolerated without any dose-limiting adverse events (AEs). In general, central nervous system (CNS) AEs limited further dose increases.55 A total of 605 patients with epilepsy have been enrolled in clinical studies for retigabine. Retigabine was mostly administered as add-on therapy to various established background AEDs and to a minor extent as monotherapy by using various dose-titration regimens.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of retigabine when added to standard AEDs was 1200 mg/day.  Retigabine was administered using BID and TID regimens. The most common AEs were CNS-related (e.g., somnolence, dizziness, confusion, speech disorder, vertigo, amnesia, thinking abnormal, tremor, incoordination, ataxia, nervousness, paresthesia, abnormal gait, diplopia, and abnormal vision) and appeared in a dose-dependent manner.55  No AEs of retigabine on cardiac safety and in particular cardiac repolarization (QTc interval) were detected.  While the AE pattern from human pharmacology and clinical trials is similar, it is interesting to note that MTDs in healthy subjects appear to be different from those achieved in patients with epilepsy, despite the concomitant medication with standard AEDs in the latter group.  A complete description of preclinical pharmacology, toxicology, PK studies, and clinical safety and efficacy studies for retigabine can be found in the Investigator\u2019s Brochure.56 CONFIDENTIALRM2009/00475/00 VRX-RET-E22-304 203Retigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304 February 10, 2006 Open-Label Phase 3 Extension Study Page 19 of 61  CONFIDENTIAL ",

All laboratory tests with values that become abnormal after drug administration will be repeated as clinically indicated until the values return to normal, or until the etiology has been determined and the condition considered stable. Abnormal laboratory test results that are considered to be clinically important by the Investigator will be reported as an AE in the CRF.  A laboratory abnormality will not be considered an AE unless: \u2022 Intervention is required. \u2022 Changes in dose of retigabine are required (decrease, discontinued, interrupted). \u2022 Other treatment/therapy is required. \u2022 Associated with other diagnoses. Laboratory results will be reported to the Investigator who will review abnormal laboratory findings for clinical significance.  The Investigator will note any laboratory test results of clinical concern, or values that were outside normal ranges and provide details of the relationship to study drug and the action taken.  If a change in a laboratory value represents a medical condition, the medical condition will be listed in the AE record. If no correlation is possible, the direction of change (increase or decrease) rather than the actual value will be recorded. ",

The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles to provide guidance to physicians and other participants in medical research involving human subjects. Medical research involving human subjects includes research on identifiable human material or identifiable data. 2. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of the people. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, \"The health of my patient will be my first consideration,\" and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, \"A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the patient.\"  4. Medical progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation involving human subjects. CONFIDENTIALRM2009/00475/00 VRX-RET-E22-304 239Retigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304 \nFebruary 10, 2006 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 55 of 61 \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \n5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being of the \nhuman subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society. \n6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve \nprophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the \naetiology and pathogenesis of disease. Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, \nand therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through research for their \neffectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. \n7. In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and \ntherapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens. \n8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human \nbeings and protect their health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable \nand need special protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically \ndisadvantaged must be recognized. Special attention is also required for those who \ncannot give or refuse consent for themselves, for those who may be subject to giving \nconsent under duress, for those who will not benefit personally from the research and for \nthose for whom the research is combined with care. \n9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements \nfor research on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international \nrequirements. No national ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should be allowed to \nreduce or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set forth in this \nDeclaration. \nBASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH \n10. It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, health, privacy, and \ndignity of the human subject. \n11. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted \nscientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other \nrelevant sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, \nanimal experimentation. \n12. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may affect the \nenvironment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected. \n13. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects \nshould be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be \nsubmitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a \nspecially appointed ethical review committee, which must be independent of the \nInvestigator, the sponsor or any other kind of undue influence. This independent \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n240\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304 \nFebruary 10, 2006 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 56 of 61 \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \ncommittee should be in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which \nthe research experiment is performed. The committee has the right to monitor ongoing \ntrials. The researcher has the obligation to provide monitoring information to the \ncommittee, especially any serious adverse events. The researcher should also submit to \nthe committee, for review, information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional \naffiliations, other potential conflicts of interest and incentives for subjects. \n14. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations \ninvolved and should indicate that there is compliance with the principles enunciated in \nthis Declaration. \n15. Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically \nqualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. \nThe responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified \nperson and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given \nconsent. \n16. Every medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful \nassessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits to \nthe subject or to others. This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in \nmedical research. The design of all studies should be publicly available. \n17. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects \nunless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and \ncan be satisfactorily managed. Physicians should cease any investigation if the risks are \nfound to outweigh the potential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positive and \nbeneficial results. \n18. Medical research involving human subjects should only be conducted if the importance \nof the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the subject. This is \nespecially important when the human subjects are healthy volunteers. \n19. Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations \nin which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research. \n20. The subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the research project. \n21. The right of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always be respected. \nEvery precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject, the confidentiality \nof the patient's information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's \nphysical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. \n22. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed \nof the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional \naffiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n241\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304 \nFebruary 10, 2006 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 57 of 61 \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \nthe discomfort it may entail. The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from \nparticipation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without \nreprisal. After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician \nshould then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If \nthe consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-written consent must be formally \ndocumented and witnessed. \n23. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be \nparticularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or \nmay consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a \nwell-informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely \nindependent of this relationship. \n24. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of \ngiving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the Investigator must obtain informed \nconsent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. \nThese groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to \npromote the health of the population represented and this research cannot instead be \nperformed on legally competent persons. \n25. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give \nassent to decisions about participation in research, the Investigator must obtain that \nassent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. \n26. Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy \nor advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents \nobtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The \nspecific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them \nunable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for \nconsideration and approval of the review committee. The protocol should state that \nconsent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the \nindividual or a legally authorized surrogate. \n27. Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of \nresearch, the Investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative \nas well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources \nof funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be \ndeclared in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the \nprinciples laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. \nCONFIDENTIAL\nRM2009/00475/00 \nVRX-RET-E22-304 \n242\nRetigabine Protocol VRX-RET-E22-304 \nFebruary 10, 2006 \nOpen-Label Phase 3 Extension Study \nPage 58 of 61 \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL \nADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH \nMEDICAL CARE \n28. The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that \nthe research is justified by its potential prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic value. \nWhen medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to \nprotect the patients who are research subjects. \n29. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against \nthose of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does \nnot exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven \nprophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.1 \n30. At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured of \naccess to the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by \nthe study.2 \n31. The physician should fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the \nresearch. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study must never interfere with the \npatient-physician relationship. \n32. In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic \nmethods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from \nthe patient, must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and \ntherapeutic measures, if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-\nestablishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be \nmade the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy.
